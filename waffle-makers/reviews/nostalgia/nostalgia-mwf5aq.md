The Nostalgia MWF5AQ MyMini is [a great choice](https://healthykitchen101.com/waffle-makers/reviews/best/) if you’re looking for a compact waffle maker. This one can fit in the palm of your hand. Performance isn’t bad for the price, though it will not help you win baking competitions. Still, it will produce some tasty, 5-inch waffles in around 5 or 8 minutes.

It has a plug-and-play design, so it has a straightforward operation. The Nostalgia is also easy to clean, thanks to the non-stick coating on the waffle plates.

Unfortunately, the Nostalgia lacks a control panel, which limits its flexibility. It also did poorly in our safety test due to the waffle maker’s tendency to become dangerously hot after a cooking session, so handle it carefully.

**Things We Like**

*   Affordable
*   Surprisingly decent cooking performance for the price
*   High build quality; solid lid hinges
*   Waffle plates’ non-stick coating performs excellently

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   No control feature
*   Oven mitts are required for handling

The Nostalgia MWF5AQ MyMini, similar to the likes of the [DASH Mini](https://healthykitchen101.com/waffle-makers/reviews/dash/dash-dmw001aq-mini/), is the perfect choice for people needing a low-cost, [portable waffle maker](https://healthykitchen101.com/waffle-makers/reviews/best/mini-waffle-makers/). You can have this model for around $10, and its small size is appealing for hikers and RV-ers who want freshly-baked waffles on the go. The small, palm-sized waffles it can make are also great for small children and snacking.

Performance: Great, As Far As Mini Waffle Makers Go
---------------------------------------------------

performance Scores: **6.3**

*   Self-Mixed Recipe (50%) - **6.8**/10
    
*   Birch Benders Mix (50%) - **5.9**/10
    

To our surprise, the Nostalgia MWF5AQ proved to be one of the top performers in the mini category within our database. In our self-mixed recipe, the waffle that it churned out was delicious, according to our chef. While the waffle it made with the Birch Benders mix wasn’t quite as good in most respects (besides texture), it’s still considered palatable.

### Self-Mixed Recipe

Color: 6.5

35% \* 6.5 = 2.3

Texture: 6

25% \* 6 = 1.5

Taste: 7.5

40% \* 7.5 = 3.0

Heat Level: N/A

Cooking Time: 6 minutes

The crust’s coloration was decent, with an appealing light brown color throughout. Within the wells were some dark brown burnt spots. They weren’t charred, but they still introduced a slight bitterness to the waffle. The texture was soft and fluffy, thanks to a high aeration rate. And taste-wise, our chef rated it as flavorful but held back from giving it a higher score due to the bitterness from the burnt spots.

#### Color (35%) — 6.5/10

*   Color tone: Light brown (Both)
*   Color distribution: Even

On the whole, the waffle had good coloration. The outer crust was light brown, with most of the darker spots concentrated inside the wells. Though it had a slightly mottled appearance, we still considered the waffle’s coloration to be uniform.

#### Texture (25%) - 6/10

*   Texture: Good
*   Aeration level: High - air bubbles were plentiful and well-sized within the waffle

The interior of the waffle was fully developed and aerated, resulting in a soft, fluffy core. Large air bubbles and pockets could be seen throughout the waffle’s interior.

#### Taste (40%) - 7.5/10

*   Flavor: Rich and sweet, slightly bitter
*   Mouthfeel: Soft and fluffy

Our chef described it as having a rich, sweet taste. Although the burnt spots on the crust introduced a slight bitterness to the waffle’s flavor profile, it was still delicious. Hence, the waffle received a good score in this section.

### Birch Benders Mix

Color: 5

35% \* 5 = 1.8

Texture: 7

25% \* 7 = 1.8

Taste: 6

40% \* 6 = 2.4

Heat Level: N/A

Cooking Time: 8 minutes

Though the pale coloration of the waffle didn't look great, the texture and taste were decent. It was soft and pliant with a taste that—while not gourmet—was good enough for breakfasts and light snacks.

#### Color (35%) — 5/10

*   Color tone: Pale gold (Both)
*   Color distribution: Even

The crust had a very light gold tone, with the pockets being slightly darker. Because the color was too light with the same tone as undercooked batter, we didn’t rate the waffle highly in this section.

#### Texture (25%) - 7/10

*   Texture: Soft, but overly moist and mushy
*   Aeration level: Medium

The overall texture was acceptable but certainly could have been better. We found several air bubbles throughout the cake's core when cutting the waffle open. They were small and had inconsistent distribution, resulting in a soft but spongy waffle.

#### Taste (40%) - 6/10

*   Flavor: Sweet and slightly savory
*   Mouthfeel: Soft, but mushy in certain spots

Our chef rated the Nostalgia’s performance in this test as “Good.” The full flavor of the Birch Benders mix was extracted: we got a sweet, slightly salty taste profile in this waffle. But where it fell short was in the mouthfeel. Though it was indeed soft, its mushiness affected the overall experience greatly.

Design: Doesn’t Feel Cheap!
---------------------------

design Scores: **8.4**

*   Build Quality (60%) - **9.0**/10
    
*   Waffle Plates (30%) - **10**/10
    
*   Control Panel (10%) - **0**/10
    

The Nostalgia MWF5AQ is quite impressive out of the box with its eye-catching "Aqua" light blue color. The plastic construction is expected from such an affordable and compact model, but it doesn't feel cheap.

One drawback to this product is that it lacks a control panel. You only get an indicator light at the top, which helps you track the cooking process.

Length: 6.8" (17.1 cm)

Width: 6.5" (16.5 cm)

Height: 3.5" (8.9 cm)

Weight: 1.3 lbs (0.6 kg)

True to its name, the Nostalgia MWF5AQ has a lightweight and compact design. The waffle maker weighs 1.25 pounds and is small enough to fit in one’s palm. Consequently, Nostalgia has focused a lot on travelers and hikers in their marketing for the MWF5AQ as they may enjoy having a waffle maker that is small enough to fit in their backpacks or luggage.

### 9.0 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl8znejm50005qu886fmc694t.jpg" alt=" Nostalgia MWF5AQ Mini Build Quality" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl75m7r7c000wme8879vf5okq.jpg" alt="A close-up shot of the hinges of the Nostalgia MWF5AQ’s lid." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl75m84id000xme8886tzg2kg.jpg" alt="The back end of the Nostalgia Mini waffle maker (MWF5AQ).

The Nostalgia waffle maker has a solid build quality for the price. Although its plastic construction makes it look and feel quite cheap, every part is built and finished well. The coloring on the lid is vibrant, the lid hinges are solid and don’t wobble, and we didn’t find any significant design or build-related issues.

### 10 - Waffle Plates

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl75mbnji000zme8872gzb5gw.jpg" alt="An overview of the Nostalgia MWF5AQ’s black, non-stick waffle plates." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl75mbzzj0010me88bs3vem2c.jpg" alt="A close-up shot of one of the Nostalgia MWF5AQ’s black, non-stick waffle plates." width="300px" height="200px">

Plate Length: 4.5" (11.4 cm)

Plate Width: 4.5" (11.4 cm)

Non Stick Coating: Yes

Removable: No

Dishwasher Safe: No

The waffle plates are Belgian-style and are coated with a layer of non-stick. Nostalgia didn’t disclose the chemical composition of the non-stick layer. Nevertheless, throughout our performance tests, the coating held up well. We have never had to deal with a sticky waffle.

### Failed - Control Panel

Indicator Lights: Yes

Audible Alarm: No

Timer: No

Browning Control: No

The Nostalgia MWF5AQ has a single indicator light at the top. It does not have any additional control features.

Plug Style: Type A (Flat Blade Attachment Plug)

Ease of Use
-----------

usability Scores: **6.3**

*   Handling (25%) - **7.5**/10
    
*   Safety (40%) - **2.5**/10
    
*   Cleanability (25%) - **9.5**/10
    
*   Indicator Light Visibility (10%) - **10**/10
    

The Nostalgia is extremely easy to use since it has no control panel — wait until the top indicator light signals that your plates are heated, then pour in the batter and begin cooking.

Safety is a concern, as with most mini models we’ve tested. After a few cooking sessions, the whole waffle maker becomes piping hot. To handle it, you need to wear oven mitts.

Cleanability is great. The plastic housing doesn’t grip aggressively onto the dried batter. The non-stick coating on the waffle plates also works very well to prevent messy batter residues.

### 7.5 - Handling

Working with the Nostalgia waffle maker is easy. Since the waffle maker has no control feature, most people won’t need to read the instruction manuals before getting started.

The lid can be opened and closed smoothly, and the hinges are solid enough that the top doesn’t jiggle or sway too much from side to side.

Like most mini waffle makers, its small size means the surfaces on the unit heat up to dangerous temperatures after a while. So, oven mitts are a must for handling the waffle maker.

### 2.5 - Safety

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl75mi1jo0012me8837111x4r.jpg" alt="The temperature of the Nostalgia MWF5AQ’s top lid is being measured using a thermometer. The screen reads 169.9°F." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl75mib980013me8860hd39iv.jpg" alt="The temperature of the Nostalgia MWF5AQ’s base is being measured using a thermometer. The screen reads 127.9°F." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl75mijld0014me88btg5fw8q.jpg" alt="The temperature of the Nostalgia MWF5AQ’s handle is being measured using a thermometer. The screen reads 149.2°F." width="300px" height="200px">

Top Side Temperature: 169.9°F

Bottom Side Temperature: 127.9°F

Handle Temperature: 149.2°F

Due to its small size, the waffle maker’s surfaces heat up quickly. So, every surface—from top to bottom—got dangerously hot.

We also noticed the Nostalgia having the same problem as other mini-size waffle makers: hot steam. After a cooking session, a hot plume of steam wafts upward from the plates when you open the lid. The flash of pain can be startling if you’re unprepared and may cause you to drop the lid, potentially damaging the waffle plates.

As such, you should always wear oven mitts while operating this waffle maker (Nostalgia included this point in the safety section in the user’s manual).

At the top of the lid, the temperature measured around 170°F.

### 9.5 - Cleanability

Excess batter pouring out from within the baking chamber of the Nostalgia MWF5AQ.

The non-stick plates help a lot with the clean-up afterward. Since the batter and the waffle didn’t stick to the plates, we only had to wipe lightly with a cloth to remove the debris and residues.

But because it’s so small, there were waffle spills from time to time. But thanks to the outer shell of the waffle maker being made from smooth plastic, which doesn’t grip onto batter tightly, they can be cleaned with just a cloth and mild detergent.

### 10 - Indicator Light Visibility

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/clco9zogv0002rd88egnufv4n.jpg" alt="The red indicator light at the top of the Nostalgia’s lid. It is shining dimly in the harsh studio light." width="300px" height="200px">

The waffle maker’s sole indicator light is bright. We could observe it easily from afar as well as under harsh studio lighting.
