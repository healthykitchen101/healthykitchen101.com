Overall Verdict
---------------

Overall Score: **7.1**

*   Performance (50%) - **7.0**/10
    
*   Design (20%) - **7.8**/10
    
*   Ease of Use (30%) - **6.8**/10
    

The Bella 13991 outperformed many expensive Belgian-style waffle models in our performance tests. While the coloration of the waffles wasn’t too great, the texture and taste were quite good. 

It has a stately, compact design and is very easy to use and handle. Cleaning the waffle maker is painless, thanks to an included drip tray.

It’s a shame that the waffle maker has fairly poor build quality (despite the beautiful design). It also has a few concerning safety issues. These can be deal-breakers for some people.

**Things We Like**

*   Affordable
*   Did a good job in both of our performance tests
*   Overall design looks very premium
*   The non-stick coating functions well

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Poor build quality
*   The lid is dangerously loose

For an entry-level waffle maker, the Bella 13991 offers a decent bang for your buck. It has an attractive, durable stainless steel body arranged in a rotating design. Based on looks alone, it's easy to see why it's become such a hit with over 15,000 users.

But whether it lives up to expectations is a different matter. That’s why we’ve bought a review unit for our lab and put it through its paces to see if it would live up to the [top-performing waffle makers](https://healthykitchen101.com/waffle-makers/reviews/best/).

Here are our test results!

Performance: Not Great, Not Terrible
------------------------------------

performance Scores: **7.0**

*   Self-Mixed Recipe (50%) - **6.9**/10
    
*   Birch Benders Mix (50%) - **7.2**/10
    

Although our first impression of the waffle maker wasn’t great due to some glaring design issues, the Bella waffle maker did fairly well across both waffle test recipes. The texture and flavor of its waffles were great — they’re not restaurant-level, but they aren’t bad for family breakfasts and light meals.

### Self-Mixed Recipe

Color: 6.25

35% \* 6.25 = 2.2

Texture: 6

25% \* 6 = 1.5

Taste: 8

40% \* 8 = 3.2

Heat Level: Maximum

Cooking Time: 7 minutes

The coloration was decent despite the waffle’s wells looking slightly burnt, and some spots on the crust looked undercooked. It received only a passable grade due to having a low aeration rate. Fortunately, it picked up the slack with its tastiness.

#### Color (6.25) — 35%

*   Color tone: Very dark brown - Light brown (both)
*   Color distribution: Even

The crust was a bit dark, but there were no signs of charring. Dark spots mostly focused within the wells of the waffle. Outside the wells, the waffle mostly had a pretty light brown color.

But since it was darker than ideal, we couldn’t give it a higher score than a “good” 6.25.

#### Texture (6) — 25%

*   Texture: Mediocre
*   Aeration level: Medium; air bubbles have begun filling the interior of the waffle. However, their sizes were small, and their numbers were few.

Air bubbles have begun to fill the interior of the waffle. Unfortunately, they haven’t developed to their full sizes just yet. All the bubbles we saw were small, concentrating mostly near the crust, while the core of the waffle was dense.

#### Taste (8) — 40%

*   Flavor: Sweet with a buttery aftertaste
*   Mouthfeel: Slightly mushy

Our chef rated the waffle highly, citing its sweet flavor and buttery aftertaste. And though the mouthfeel was a bit underwhelming, it didn’t seriously affect the waffle’s quality.

### Birch Benders Mix

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl6zz3bge000oc6889ude9zzv.jpg" alt="BELLA 13991 Classic Birch Benders Mix Video" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl8labdd6000edn8857521pfb.jpg" alt="The golden top crust of a waffle baked for 8 minutes using a batter made from the Birch Benders mix." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl8labp63000fdn881noheljq.jpg" alt="The golden bottom crust of a waffle baked for 8 minutes using a batter made from the Birch Benders mix." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl8labzfb000gdn887iig0io3.jpg" alt="The cross-section of a waffle baked for 8 minutes, revealing its internal core filled with air bubbles and air cavities." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl8lac8h0000hdn8826oaa7nn.jpg" alt="A waffle baked for 8 minutes being torn down the middle by hand to test it for its consistency and texture." width="300px" height="200px">

Color: 8

35% \* 8 = 2.8

Texture: 7.8

25% \* 7.8 = 1.9

Taste: 6

40% \* 6 = 2.4

Heat Level: Maximum

Cooking Time: 8 minutes

In this test, the Bella waffle maker did a slightly better job, but not by a lot. 

Coloration is visibly improved with a more even, prettier coloration. Unfortunately, because the waffle is peppered with air pockets, it has several discolored spots. The texture is decent, but its aeration level is still low, resulting in a mushy texture. The mushy texture is one of the reasons why our chef didn't give the waffle a high score on the taste test.

#### Color (8/10) — 35%

*   Color tone: Light gold (Both)
*   Color distribution: Even

The crust on both sides of the waffle maker had a beautiful golden-brown color. On the crust were large formations of air bubbles, which had a pale yellow color of undercooked batter. Besides ruining the overall look of the waffle, they also messed with the color palette.

#### Texture (7.8/10) — 25%

*   Texture: Good
*   Aeration level: Medium; air bubbles have begun to develop, but they haven’t reached their maximum sizes

The waffle has filled out well with a thick, soft interior. It has a medium aeration rate, evidenced by the many tiny air bubbles within its core. The bubbles were in the process of forming and expanding, but the aeration process was cut short before it could reach completion. Thus, while the waffle was soft and spongy, it was still too moist on the inside to receive a higher score.

#### Taste (6/10) — 40%

*   Flavor: Sweet and slightly savory, cloying in undercooked parts
*   Mouthfeel: Soft and spongy for the most parts, mushy in certain spots

As a whole, the waffle’s flavor profile was decent. It had the signature sweet and slightly savory taste of the Birch Benders mix. However, certain parts of the waffle were undercooked and gave it an off-putting cloying taste, which negatively impacted its scoring on this test.

Design
------

design Scores: **7.8**

*   Build Quality (60%) - **7.0**/10
    
*   Waffle Plates (30%) - **9.0**/10
    
*   Control Panel (10%) - **8.5**/10
    

With its glossy stainless steel exterior similar to pricier models like the [Cuisinart WAF-F20P1](https://healthykitchen101.com/waffle-makers/reviews/cuisinart/cuisinart-waf-f20p1-double/) or the [Hamilton Beach 26031](https://healthykitchen101.com/waffle-makers/reviews/hamilton-beach/hamilton-beach-26031/), the Bella 13991 has all the hallmarks of a premium machine. But upon closer inspection, we found that the build quality isn’t very high, mainly due to the dangerously wobbly lid.

Apart from this glitch, other components of the Bella 13991, like the waffle plates, control panel, and power cord, are all up-to-par.

*   User manual
*   Drip tray

The box includes the waffle maker, a user manual, and a drip tray.

### Dimensions

Length: 16.7" (42.4 cm)

Width: 7.7" (19.6 cm)

Height: 7.3" (18.5 cm)

Weight: 5.2 lbs (2.4 kg)

The Bella 13991 is more difficult to store due to its rotating design, which brings its height to 7.3 inches. Fortunately, Bella makes storage less annoying by making the handle foldable. The waffle maker's footprint can be reduced with the handle folded and the body rotated vertically.

### 7.0 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl5hl5h5w000auz88e2fybaaf.jpg" alt="The Bella 13991 rotating waffle maker mid-turn.

The Bella 13991's body is made from stainless steel with a mirror finish, which gives it a somewhat premium look. However, we noticed that the mirror finish could be smudged easily and is highly susceptible to scratches. However, a much more serious issue was the extremely loose lid hinge. Whenever it's opened or adjusted, the lid wobbles dangerously.

### 9.0 - Waffle Plates

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl57udc6m001l6588db111p36.jpg" alt="A close-up of one of the Bella 13991’s waffle plates. The plate has a Belgian-style patterning and a black non-stick coating." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl57ueoe4001m6588g8lddswe.jpg" alt="An overview of the Bella 13991’s double waffle plates." width="300px" height="200px">

Number of Plates: 2

Grid Pattern: Belgian-style

Plate Area: 44.18 inch

Plate Length: 7.5" (19.1 cm)

Plate Width: 7.5" (19.1 cm)

Material: Cast aluminum

Non Stick Coating: Yes

Removable: No

Dishwasher Safe: No

The waffle plates are cast aluminum coated with a layer of PFOA-free Teflon. In all of our tests, the non-stick coating worked perfectly. The waffles slid cleanly off the plates without leaving messy residue behind.

A small anti-spill moat runs around the perimeter of each plate. The moat is too small to catch big spills, which isn’t particularly helpful.

### 8.5 - Control Panel

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl57ub06z001k65882k71a5x7.jpg" alt="A close-up on the Bella 13991 waffle maker’s control panel, with the two indicator lights and the browning control dial in frame." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl5hm1vv5000duz882jw78h7t.jpg" alt="BELLA 13991 Classic Control Panel video" width="300px" height="200px">

Indicator Lights: Yes

Audible Alarm: No

Timer: No

Browning Control: Yes

The temperature dial turns smoothly but doesn’t have any specific temperature notches or settings. Instead, there are only “Min” and a “Max” labels on either side. The user can tune the dial to any arbitrary point in between.

You will find a red POWER button under the dial, which shines when you plug in the waffle maker. The blue READY button beside it will light up when the plates are thoroughly heated and ready for use.

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl57u6066001j65884577eciw.jpg" alt="The power plug of the Bella 13991, highlighting the Type-A prongs." width="300px" height="200px">

Plug Style: Type A (Flat Blade Attachment Plug)

Length: 2.2 ft (0.7 m)

Cable Management: No

The power cord is relatively short, so you may have to use an extension cord. There is no cable management feature on the Bella 13991.

### Accessories: Drip Tray

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl49mfp5300021l8837ceed0r.jpg" alt="The removable black plastic drip tray of the Hamilton Beach 26031." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic

Removable: Yes

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

A drip tray accompanies the waffle maker in the shipping box. It slides in underneath the waffle maker’s body. The tray does a great job of catching spilled batter. It is removable and dishwasher-safe.

Ease of Use
-----------

usability Scores: **6.8**

*   Handling (25%) - **3.0**/10
    
*   Safety (40%) - **7.9**/10
    
*   Cleanability (25%) - **9.5**/10
    
*   Indicator Light Visibility (10%) - **5.0**/10
    

The Bella 13991’s flimsy construction didn’t do very well in both our handling and safety tests, but it scored points for being very easy to clean. Overall, the waffle maker only squeaked past the test by a hair.

### 3.0 - Handling

It failed the handling test due to the dangerously loose lid. Whenever we started a new waffle, we had to hold the lid with one hand while pouring with the other. If we dared remove that stabilizing hand, the lid had a good chance of snapping shut unexpectedly.

Except for this critical issue, the Bella 13991 is easy to use. The control panel is simple, and the waffle maker turns smoothly. A lock is built into the handle and keeps the lid securely shut when the waffle maker is flipped.

### 7.9 - Safety

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl57qd4bv000y65881glj11xh.jpg" alt="The temperature of the plastic base of the Bella 13991 waffle maker is being measured using a thermometer.

The screen reads 90.5°F." width="300px" height="200px">

Top Side Temperature: 153°F

Bottom Side Temperature: 85°F

Handle Temperature: 90°F

The unsteady lid is a serious safety issue. Fortunately, aside from the lid, we didn’t find any other significant safety problems.

The top of the lid got warm — but not dangerously so — at 147°F.

Both the handle and the base remained cool to the touch. The measured temperatures in these areas were respectively 90° and 85° after several rounds of testings.

### 9.5 - Cleanability

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl7brzrf00011td881pr2973p.jpg" alt="BELLA 13991 Classic Cleanability" width="300px" height="200px">

The Bella 13991 is very easy to clean. Though it’s prone to fingerprint smudges and scratches, the metal surfaces can be cleaned and polished with mild detergent. The waffle plates only need to be wiped down with paper towels every once in a while to get rid of waffle debris. We also don't find it difficult to scrub dried batter off the plastic parts of the waffle maker.

When a spill happens, the large drip tray can catch every droplet. The tray can be washed by hand or loaded into a dishwasher.

### 5.0 - Indicator Light Visibility

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl57tcu1o001h65882qnk1223.jpg" alt="The set of indicator lights at the top of the Bella 13991’s waffle maker. The blue READY light and the red POWER light are on." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl57tecyv001i65888y0oalbl.jpg" alt="The shining READY light at the bottom of the Bella 13991’s waffle maker." width="300px" height="200px">

The lights are very dim. It’s almost impossible to see them from afar under harsh lighting. Even with some ambient lights turned off, the indicator lights are still faint.
