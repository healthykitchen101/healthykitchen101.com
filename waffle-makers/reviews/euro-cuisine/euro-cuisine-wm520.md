The Euro Cuisine WM520 is a good choice if you’re looking for a heart-shaped (Norwegian-style) waffle maker.

Its performance, while not exceptional, is good enough for breakfasts and snacks. Thanks to the chrome accents, the exterior of the waffle maker has a premium look. The waffle plates within are well-constructed. They also have a ceramic coating for non-stick, which poses less risk health-wise than Teflon.

One concern with this model has to do with safety. The whole waffle maker gets very hot after only a few cooking sessions, so it’s recommended that you wear oven mitts while handling it.

**Things We Like**

*   Did a passable job in our self-mixed recipe test
*   Luxurious design with chrome lid
*   Easy to use control panel with clicky, responsive browning level dial
*   Eco-friendly PTFE and PFOA-free ceramic coating on the plates
*   Excellent cleanability

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Loose lid hinges
*   The rubber screw protectors can be easily lost
*   Many surfaces of the waffle maker became scorching hot after two-three cooking sessions

The Euro Cuisine WM520 Heart Shaped waffle maker differs from [the rest of the models](https://healthykitchen101.com/waffle-makers/reviews/best/) we’ve tested. It’s neither a Belgian-style nor American-style (or “classic-style”) waffle maker. Instead, it is a Norwegian-style waffle maker characterized by plates printed with five shallow, heart-shaped segments.

Here is how this model fares in our hands-on test.

Using the Euro Cuisine WM520, we were pleased with its consistent performance throughout our tests. Although not of five-star quality, the fluffy waffles would still be an ideal accompaniment to any breakfast table.

### Self-Mixed Recipe

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl6zw17ed000dc6886dg93xvx.jpg" alt="Euro Cuisine WM520 Self-Mixed Recipe Test" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl6ysinjp0010bx88aks5e4vs.jpg" alt="The light brown top crust of a waffle baked for 5 minutes 30 seconds using our self-mixed recipe." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl6ysm81t0012bx881q7912gw.jpg" alt="The light brown bottom crust of a waffle baked for 5 minutes 30 seconds using our self-mixed recipe." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl6yspcnz0013bx88328d8zdk.jpg" alt="A cross-section of a waffle baked for 5 minutes 30 seconds.

Color: 7.5

35% \* 7.5 = 2.6

Texture: 5

25% \* 5 = 1.3

Taste: 6

40% \* 6 = 2.4

Heat Level: Medium-high

Cooking Time: 5 minutes 30 seconds

The waffle has beautiful coloration: golden-brown on the outside with dark brown spots within the wells. However, the interior was mushy, which also affected the taste of the waffle by introducing a slight raw batter-like taste to its flavor profile.

#### Color (35%) — 7.5/10

*   Color tone: Light brown
*   Color distribution: Even

We rated the waffle to have great coloration. The outer crust had a light brown tone, and the diamond-shaped wells had a dark brown color. Examining the wells closely, we found that they weren’t charred, which is ideal.

Both sides of the waffle were roughly the same color, but the wells at the bottom were lighter-colored than the top.

#### Texture (25%) - 5/10

*   Texture: Mediocre
*   Aeration level: Low, minimal presence of air bubbles and air pockets

Though the outside of the waffle looked splendid, the interior was a different story. It was clear that the batter hadn’t had the chance to fully develop, judging by how mushy it still was.

The low aeration level was also apparent in the low number of air bubbles and air pockets within the waffle’s interior.

#### Taste (40%) - 6/10

*   Flavor: Sweet and savory, with a hint of raw batter
*   Mouthfeel: Soft and fluffy, but slightly dry

Our chef found the flavor of the waffle to be acceptable. The sweetness and the savory taste of the batter were there. However, there was also a slight taste of raw batter due to the undercooked interior, which effectively ruined the tasting experience.

### Birch Benders Mix

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl6zwz5gj000lc688d1jzg3hg.jpg" alt="Euro Cuisine WM520 Birch Benders Mix Test" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl6yqtos9000sbx8850ob2z6x.jpg" alt="The light brown top crust of a waffle baked for 5 minutes 30 seconds using a batter made from the Birch Benders mix." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl6yrwknq000ubx883pjjfms5.jpg" alt="The light brown bottom crust of a waffle baked for 5 minutes 30 seconds using a batter made from the Birch Benders mix." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl6yscood000ybx88c4esh23r.jpg" alt="A cross-section of a waffle baked for 5 minutes and 30 seconds.

Color: 7

35% \* 7 = 2.5

Texture: 5.5

25% \* 5.5 = 1.4

Taste: 6.5

40% \* 6.5 = 2.6

Heat Level: Medium-high

Cooking Time: 5 minutes 30 seconds

The Euro Cuisine WM520 managed to carry over the same level of performance it displayed in the self-mixed recipe test to this second test. The coloration—slightly lighter than in the previous test—was still considered good. Texturally, the waffle has a marginally better aeration rate compared to the waffle from the previous test. It resulted in a slightly better taste score from our chef due to the improved softness.

#### Color (35%) — 7/10

*   Color result: Light brown (Both)
*   Color distribution: Even

Both sides of the waffle were covered in a light brown-gold crust. While beautiful, it was a smidge lighter than ideal, resulting in a slightly lower score than the waffle made from our self-mixed recipe. Within the diamond-shaped wells of the waffle, the coloring was an attractive light brown.

#### Texture (25%) — 5.5/10

*   Texture: Mediocre
*   Aeration level: Low, few air bubbles

The aeration rate of the waffle remained low, but it still has more air pockets spread out throughout the interior than the waffle from the previous test. Texturally, the waffle was moist and mushy.

#### Taste (40%) — 6.5/10

*   Flavor: Savory, slightly sweet
*   Mouthfeel: Fairly soft, but mushy

Due to the improved texture, the tasting experience was also better. Since the Birch Benders mix had a different composition than our self-mixed recipe, the flavor was different too. It was more savory and less sweet, but tasty nonetheless.

Though the waffle was still considered mushy, our chef welcomed the soft texture.

Design: Luxurious & Intuitive

The Euro Cuisine WM520 has a luxe, chrome-plated housing. It gives the waffle maker a very luxurious appearance.

Though overall construction is sound, the flimsy lid hinges could do some refinement. Positioned on top of the lid is an intuitive control panel that pairs a dial for adjusting browning levels with two indicator lights (one for power, one for the ready status of the waffle maker).

### In the Box

In the box are the waffle maker itself and an instruction manual. No other accessory is included.

### Dimensions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/clakt4u07003lto888gzvgo6h.jpg" alt="The side profile of the Euro Cuisine WM520. Its mirror-like lid and the vertically-arranged control panel can be seen." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 10.0" (25.4 cm)

Width: 8.0" (20.3 cm)

Height: 4.5" (11.4 cm)

Weight: 4.0 lbs (1.8 kg)

The Euro Cuisine WM520 has an average size relative to other standard-size waffle makers in our database. It weighs 4 pounds and has a broad body that measures 10 inches long and 8 inches wide. Thus, it will take up quite a lot of space on your countertop.

Since it’s roughly the same size as the average Belgian or classic-style waffle maker, it shouldn’t be any more challenging to store.

### 9.0 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl846akyb0006lw889gv311md.jpg" alt="The Euro Cuisine WM520 Build Quality" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl6yqdwfj000pbx88ct1xaxjj.jpg" alt="The elaborate backside of the Euro Cuisine waffle maker (WM520)." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl6yqei45000qbx886r1ygbki.jpg" alt="A close-up view of the plastic detailing and components of the Euro Cuisine waffle maker." width="300px" height="200px">

The unit's build quality is very decent, on par with some of the best ones on our list, such as the [Hamilton Beach 26031](https://healthykitchen101.com/waffle-makers/reviews/hamilton-beach/hamilton-beach-26031/).

The outer chrome plate has a mirror finish, which looks stunning out of the box. However, like with any other mirror-finished surface, we noticed that it’s highly susceptible to scratches and fingerprints. Oil splashes during cooking can also cause faint black stains on the lid.

Due to being mounted on a pair of loose hinges, the lid tends to wobble when in use.

The chrome-plated lid aside, other components like the control panel and the bottom casing are made from plastic. The front handle is also made from plastic and is rubberized to protect the user from the heat.

Underneath the handle is a rubber piece that comes off very easily, only needing a light tug. Behind it is a pair of screws. We presume the screws are to attach the handle to the front of the lid. It’s a clever way to hide the hideous screws and make the design look seamless.

However, many people may throw it away, not knowing what it does since Euro Cuisine did not mention it in the manual. Or, it could be easily lost due to its size and how it comes off so readily.

### 10 - Waffle Plates

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl6yq78mb000obx8871n1fgbo.jpg" alt="An overhead shot of the black waffle plates of the Euro Cuisine waffle maker. The plates have heart-shaped patterns." width="300px" height="200px">

Number of Plates: 2

Grid Pattern: Norwegian-style

Plate Area: 50.27 inches

Plate Length: 8.0" (20.3 cm)

Plate Width: 8.0" (20.3 cm)

Material: Cast aluminum

Non Stick Coating: Yes

Removable: No

Dishwasher Safe: No

The waffle plates are built remarkably well. The patterning on the plates is clear and precise. Within each heart-shaped segment are several “spikes” in the shape of diamonds. They are responsible for creating the wells on the final waffle. Each spike is sharp and well-built.

According to Euro Cuisine, the plates are coated with a layer of non-stick ceramic. Additionally, it’s completely PFOA and PTFE-free. In our test, the coating worked well enough that we never had to deal with a sticky waffle.

### 9.5 - Control Panel

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl845va4c0004lw8805817r9z.jpg" alt="The Euro Cuisine WM520 Control Panel" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl6ypxgjo000ibx889g14b89k.jpg" alt="The control panel of the Euro Cuisine waffle maker. The browning control dial can be seen, along with the indicator lights." width="300px" height="200px">

Indicator Lights: Yes

Audible Alarm: No

Timer: No

Browning Control: Yes

The control panel consists of two indicator lights and a browning control knob.

The knob is tactile and makes a satisfying clicking sound as it turns. There are markings on the dial, which correspond to four heating modes.

These amount to a MIN and a MAX  mode. In-between are two unnamed heating modes marked with one and two dots. For easier identification, we named these settings “Medium” and “Medium High,” respectively.

Above the dial are two indicator lights; each one is marked. A red POWER button turns on when you plug in the unit. The yellow READY button at the back will turn on once the plates are heated and ready for use.

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl6ypg0j7000dbx8835x32m1b.jpg" alt="The power cord of the Euro Cuisine waffle maker. It has a Type A plug." width="300px" height="200px">

Plug Style: Type A (Flat Blade Attachment Plug)

Length: 2.3 ft (0.7 m)

Cable Management: Yes

The power cord is relatively short, measuring around 26.5 inches. You will need an extension cord if it can’t reach an outlet in your kitchen. The user manual has more information on what type of extension cord you can use with the waffle maker.

Underneath the waffle maker is a convenient cord wrap that you can use to make storage simpler.

The Euro Cuisine WM520's sole control input is the browning control dial, which lets you set the desired browning level by tuning it. Two indicator lights at the top inform you how far along your food is in cooking. Once you're finished cooking, the non-stick coating on the plates helps simplify cleaning.

Unfortunately, it didn't fare well in our safety test due to an alarmingly hot handle. Still, that doesn't detract from its overall ease of use and convenience.

### 8.5 - Handling

The Euro Cuisine WM520 is rather straightforward to use. Tune the browning dial to the desired setting, wait for the READY light to come on, then load in the batter. If you have used a waffle maker before, you should be able to do everything without consulting the user manual.

During our test, the wobbly lid was a point of annoyance. Fortunately, the wobbling motion wasn’t serious enough for it to become an obstruction or an outright safety problem.

### 2.5 - Safety

Top Side Temperature: 146.8°F

Bottom Side Temperature: 107.6°F

Handle Temperature: 137.8°F

The Euro Cuisine WM520 gets a fairly low score in this section. The entire waffle maker became piping hot after only three cooking sessions.

In particular, the control panel area became so hot that we had to use oven mitts to safely turn the browning control dial. Using a thermometer, we recorded a temperature of 146.8°F. You could receive a [burn injury](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539773/) if you held your bare fingers there for only a few seconds.

The temperature at the bottom of the waffle maker was, fortunately, merely warm at 107.6°F.

The handle is our most serious concern. After three cooking sessions, it had already heated up to a toasty 137.8°F. which may result in a minor burn. So, wear your oven mitts while handling the waffle maker.

### 10 - Cleanability

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl6zx6e6v000mc6886ifhh604.jpg" alt="Excess batter spilling out from the Euro Cuisine waffle maker’s cooking plates." width="300px" height="200px">

The non-stick layer on the waffle plates makes it very easy to clean. In our performance tests, very little debris or residue was left behind. Any leftovers could be easily wiped off with a clean cloth.

In the case of a batter spill: as the exterior of the waffle maker is made from smooth plastic, the dried-out batter doesn’t stick. We only had to apply a little bit of detergent and scrub lightly with a cloth to knock any dried batter traces loose.

### 10 - Indicator Light Visibility

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl846ez4r0008lw88ekoieknf.jpg" alt="The indicator lights of the Euro Cuisine. The red POWER light is closest to the dial, the orange READY light is to the back." width="300px" height="200px">

The indicator lights are bright. They can be seen from afar and underneath harsh studio lighting.
