Affordability is the main attractor that drew people to the Black and Decker WMD200B Double Waffle Maker. However, the waffle maker can offer more than just a wallet-friendly price tag. Its performance is acceptable across all waffle recipes in our tests. Although there is still room for improvement concerning the waffles' quality, none of the waffles were considered unpalatable by our chef.

The heating is even on both sides of the waffle maker. You can cook both waffles simultaneously and expect them to have the same qualities.

Though it may lack some standard features, such as a temperature control switch, its design, and overall build quality are excellent.

**Things We Like**

*   Capable of cooking two waffles at once with the double-sided design
*   Acceptable performance across all two tests
*   Solid build quality for the price
*   Plug-and-play design makes it very easy to use
*   Great cleanability thanks to the included drip tray

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Bulky and heavy
*   Tends to undercook the bottom of the waffle
*   Lacks a control panel

Being one of the more affordable [double-sided waffle makers](https://healthykitchen101.com/waffle-makers/reviews/best/), the Black and Decker WMD200B Double Waffle Maker offers consumers a fairly compelling deal. For far less than a premium double waffle maker like the [Cuisinart WAF-F20P1](https://healthykitchen101.com/waffle-makers/reviews/cuisinart/cuisinart-waf-f20p1-double/), you can also enjoy the unique perk of cooking two waffles at once.

But affordability and popularity won’t mean much if the [Belgian-style cookers](https://healthykitchen101.com/waffle-makers/reviews/best/belgian-waffle-makers/#4-black-decker-wmd200b-waffle-maker-best-budget-double-belgian-waffle-maker) doesn’t perform well. Therefore, we decided to put the WMD200B to the test in our lab. In this in-depth review, you will be able to get a closer look at this waffle maker and see for yourself what it’s capable of.

Performance: Tasty, but Uneven
------------------------------

performance Scores: **NaN**

*   Self-Mixed Recipe (50%) - **6.1**/undefined
    
*   Birch Benders Mix (50%) - **6.3**/undefined
    

Our head chef labeled the waffles made by the WMD200B as “decently tasty.” Unfortunately, the coloration and texture of the waffle could still use some improvements.

Our test unit has a recurrent issue with undercooking one side of its waffles, lending to each waffle having an uneven coloring and a mushier texture on the undercooked side.

### Self-Mixed Recipe

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl8jqyjiq001r1e886dtwb9so.jpg" alt="The very dark brown top crust of a waffle cooked in 5 minutes." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl8jqysds001s1e88hox4brpc.jpg" alt="The very dark brown bottom crust of a waffle cooked in 5 minutes." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl8jqz2eh001t1e886jvhbsxj.jpg" alt="The interior of a waffle with multiple air bubbles visible." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl8jqzc8c001u1e88710v7yab.jpg" alt="A waffle baked in 5 minutes being torn by hands to reveal the inner core during a texture test." width="300px" height="200px">

Color: 5.25

35% \* 5.25 = 1.8

Texture: 6.5

25% \* 6.5 = 1.6

Taste: 6.5

40% \* 6.5 = 2.6

Heat Level: N/A

Cooking Time: 5 minutes

The WMD200B’s performance was disappointing in this test. With the updated recipe, we had expected it to show better results. Unfortunately, the coloration, texture, and taste were still acceptable at best and mediocre at worst.

#### Color (35%) — 5.25/10

*   Color result: Very dark brown (Top)—Very light gold (Bottom)
*   Color distribution: Uneven

The BLACK+DECKER WMD200B still suffered from uneven heating, a problem we already noticed in the first rounds of testing. The top side of the waffle was so well-cooked that some spots looked charred. Meanwhile, the bottom was several shades lighter. The odd difference in coloring made the waffle look very unappealing.

#### Texture (25%) — 6.5/10

*   Texture: Mediocre
*   Aeration level: Medium level. Bubbles were beginning to form but hadn’t finished developing

The aeration rate was low. Nonetheless, we still saw plenty of air bubbles spread throughout the interior of the waffle. And while there was a degree of mushiness to the waffle, it wasn’t so bad to the point of being limp and soggy.

#### Taste (40%) — 6.5/10

*   Taste: Sweet and flavorful. A hint of bitterness from the burnt spots.
*   Mouthfeel: Soft. Burnt spots give the waffle a dry texture.

Flavor-wise, our chef gave the waffle a passable score. Although the flavors were there, the bitterness from the burnt top crust ruined the overall taste profile of the waffle. Plus, the unremarkable texture of the waffle didn’t do the WMD200B any good in this section.

### Birch Benders Mix

Color: 6.3

35% \* 6.3 = 2.2

Texture: 5

25% \* 5 = 1.3

Taste: 7

40% \* 7 = 2.8

Heat Level: N/A

Cooking Time: 7 minutes 30 seconds

Coloration is better with a more eye-catching golden brown tone. The color is distributed uniformly across the whole waffle. Despite not having a high aeration level, the waffle still attains a soft and spongy texture, albeit slightly mushy. Our chef rated the waffle’s taste as good, citing its sweet flavor. But she clocked a few points due to the taste of raw batter still being present.

#### Color (35%) — 6.3/10

*   Color result: Golden brown (Top) - Pale gold (Bottom)
*   Color distribution: Even

In the pre-made mix test the coloration was better compared to our self-made recipe. The top side achieved a beautiful golden brown color that was spread evenly throughout the waffle. The indents had slightly darker coloring, but they weren’t burnt or charred.

The bottom of the waffle was a lot less impressive. It had a pale yellow, almost white color, which seemed to point to the waffle being undercooked.

Interestingly, the same disparity in coloration between the two sides of the waffle can be observed in other performance tests that we’ve done with the WMD200B.

#### Texture (25%) — 5/10

*   Texture: Mediocre
*   Aeration level: Low level, bubbles were tiny in size.

The aeration level is low. The waffle was filled with small bubbles, which created a soft and spongy texture. However, because the batter hadn’t been fully developed, the core of the waffle still felt a little mushy and moist when touched.

#### Taste (40%) — 7/10

*   Taste: Sweet and flavorful, but with a hint of raw batter due to the undercooked bottom
*   Texture: Soft at the top, pulpy at the bottom.

Our chef rated the waffle “good”. The WMD200B brought out the waffle's sweet and slightly savory flavor.

Unfortunately, the undercooked bottom impacted the mouthfeel of the waffle, which was pulpy compared to the soft and consistent top side.

Design: Cheaper Than it Looks

*   Control Panel (10%) - **0**/undefined
    

The BLACK+DECKER WMD200B is an incredibly well-crafted machine for an entry-level product. Though it is made mostly from plastic, the waffle maker doesn’t look cheap. It’s not hard to imagine it as a mid-range or even a high-end model.

The non-stick waffle plates are coated with non-stick, which works well during our performance tests. This model's only downside is that it doesn’t come with a control panel.

### In the Box

*   Waffle maker
*   Drip tray
*   User manual

In the shipping box, you will find the waffle maker, a drip tray, and a user manual. Everything is nicely packaged in plastic wraps and foam blocks.

### Dimensions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl5dnho1k000ckp88ap8i6gmr.jpg" alt="The Black and Decker WMD200B waffle maker with measurement markers to the side, showing the height as 7 inches, the length as 13 inches, and the width as 7.5 inches." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 13.0" (33.0 cm)

Width: 7.5" (19.1 cm)

Height: 7.0" (17.8 cm)

Weight: 7.3 lbs (3.3 kg)

The body is bulkier and larger than standard models, which might make storage a challenge. The WMD200B is heavier, too. At 7.25 pounds, it is easily twice the weight of your average waffle maker. Most of the additional weight comes from the extra pair of waffle plates.

### 10 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl50j6ees002oh3889ri00vvx.jpg" alt="The back hinge of the Black and Decker WMD200B rotating waffle maker’s baking chamber. Two metallic cabling sleeves are snaking around the back." width="300px" height="200px">

The exterior of the waffle maker is made from black plastic. While durability is a definite concern, plastic is lighter and less thermally conductive, thus safer than metal.

Other parts of the waffle maker, like the base, the handle, and the hinges, are all solidly constructed. We especially like the metal-clad cabling connecting the heating elements and electronics. The metal cladding ensures durability and protects from electrical leakage.

### 9.5 - Waffle Plates

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl50pgri9002zh388en5r7737.jpg" alt="An overview of the Black & Decker double flip waffle maker WMD200B’s cooking plates." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl50phobh0030h388e36i49wp.jpg" alt="Close-up view of one of the Black and Decker WMD200B’s black, Belgian-style waffle plates." width="300px" height="200px">

Number of Plates: 4

Grid Pattern: Belgian-style

Plate Area: 36.32 inches

Plate Length: 6.8" (17.3 cm)

Plate Width: 6.8" (17.3 cm)

Material: Cast iron

Non Stick Coating: Yes

Removable: No

Dishwasher Safe: No

The waffle plates are made from cast iron and boast a layer of proprietary non-stick coating. BLACK+DECKER hasn’t elaborated much on its non-stick formula. However, they did tell us that the coating is: “stable, inert, non-reactive, and PFOA-free.” It seems to be the same coating they use for the waffle plates of the [BLACK+DECKER WMB500](https://healthykitchen101.com/waffle-makers/reviews/black-decker/black-decker-wmb500/).

The waffle plates are not removable.

### Failed - Control Panel

Indicator Lights: Yes

Audible Alarm: No

Timer: No

Browning Control: No

The BLACK+DECKER WMD200B does not come with a control panel.

Instead, it has a series of indicator lights. One is a red POWER light, which comes when you plug in the waffle maker. The other is a green READY Light, which lights up when the waffle maker reaches the correct cooking temperature.

You will find the lights at the waffle maker's top and bottom.

As it lacks any real control features, we cannot give it any points for this section.

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl50j4n0h002nh3881hdqf0mv.jpg" alt="A close-up view of the power plug of the Black and Decker WMD200B double flip waffle maker." width="300px" height="200px">

Plug Style: Type A (Flat Blade Attachment Plug)

Length: 2.0 ft (0.6 m)

Cable Management: No

The power cord is very short, measuring only around 24 inches. Be sure to keep the waffle maker close to a power outlet. If not, use an extension cord.

There’s no cable management feature on the waffle maker.

### Accessories: Drip Tray

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl50j31qr002mh38868o25ap1.jpg" alt="The removable and washable black, plastic drip tray of the Black and Decker double waffle maker WMD200B." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic

Removable: Yes

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

The BLACK+DECKER WMD200B comes with a plastic drip tray.

The BLACK+DECKER WMD200B is very easy to use overall. It can be operated with just one hand, from lifting the lid to flipping it. 

We also rate the cleanability of this waffle maker highly. Besides the non-stick waffle plates, which reduce batter residues, the add-on drip tray can help protect your countertop from any excess batter that spills out from the baking chamber.

It does get tricky, though, when you have to clean the tiny nooks and crannies of the waffle maker. Some parts are so small that it’s impossible to reach in and scrub out the dried batter residues.

### 9.5 - Handling

The large handle allows for an easier and more comfortable grip. Located right within the handle is the lid lock. It can be engaged or disengaged with a push or pull motion, respectively.

WMD200B is rotatable. The rotating mechanism of our review unit worked smoothly.

### 9.9 - Safety

The screen reads 87°F." width="300px" height="200px">

Top Side Temperature: 144°F

Bottom Side Temperature: 86°F

Handle Temperature: 87°F

The top side of the waffle maker can get quite hot after a few cooking sessions. We measured a peak temperature of 144°F, hot enough to cause a minor burn injury.

All other parts remained cool to the touch. The handle was 87°F, and the base of the waffle maker was 86°F.

### 8.5 - Cleanability

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl50is17i002hh3882knmhy39.jpg" alt="A close-up of dirty gunks and leftover batter within a small nook next to the handle of the Black and Decker WMD200B double Belgian waffle maker." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl50ismdo002ih3885zergwad.jpg" alt="The Black+Decker WMD200B Double waffle maker with batter spilling out from inside the waffle plates down to the drip tray below." width="300px" height="200px">

Most parts of the BLACK+DECKER WMD200B are easy to clean. But some awkward spots may give you trouble, such as the tiny nooks next to the handle. Liquid waffle batter can drip inside and dry out within. The size of the corner makes it very difficult to guide a towel inside and scrub out the dried mess.

The included drip tray makes dealing with batter spillages a lot easier.

### 7.0 - Indicator Light Visibility

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl50iqdte002gh388gdh3hh9m.jpg" alt="A close-up of the indicator lights on the Black and Decker WMD200B double Belgian waffle maker. Both lights are shining dimly, one green and one red." width="300px" height="200px">

The indicator lights were bright enough to see from across the room under normal lighting conditions. Under studio lighting, they became very difficult to see from afar. We had to walk up to the waffle maker to view the lights.
