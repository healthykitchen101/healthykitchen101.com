Considered a high-end waffle maker, the Cuisinart Double Waffle Maker (WAF-F20P1) has the look and cooking performance to suit its price. The waffles we cooked using the WAF-F20P1 during performance tests always came out beautifully and tasty.

From a design standpoint, the waffle maker is durable and beautifully constructed. However, some parts of the waffle maker are made from plastic rather than metal, which can negatively impact its durability. The WAF-F20P1 is also easy to use but a bit challenging to clean.

All in all, it's a great waffle maker to buy if you have a big budget. It’s a chart-topper in our top Belgian waffle maker list, which you can see through [this link](https://healthykitchen101.com/waffle-makers/reviews/best/belgian-waffle-makers/). Cuisinart also offers more budget-friendly options, such as the [Cuisinart WMR-CA classic waffle maker](https://healthykitchen101.com/waffle-makers/reviews/cuisinart/cuisinart-wmr-ca-classic/).

**Things We Like**

*   Strong cooking performance across all tests
*   Beautiful, durable stainless steel design
*   Comprehensive control panel with audible alarm
*   Intuitive lid locking mechanism
*   Comes with a batter measuring cup

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Mediocre performance with self-mixed recipe
*   Heavy and bulky
*   Certain parts are made of plastic

A double Belgian waffle maker like the Cuisinart WAF-F20P1 can appeal to large households. It cuts down on breakfast prep time by cooking two waffles at once.

We’ve tested the WAF-F20P1 in our lab to see how good it is compared to [waffle makers in our database](https://healthykitchen101.com/waffle-makers/reviews/best/). Here are the full test results!

Performance: Not Restaurant-Grade … But Close

This waffle maker gets a passing score. It wasn’t restaurant-quality by any means, and there were plenty of flaws in terms of coloration and texture. Nonetheless, the WAF-F20P1 still produced a decent waffle in our self-mixed recipe test.

### Self-Mixed Recipe

Color: 6.5

35% \* 6.5 = 2.3

Texture: 5.5

25% \* 5.5 = 1.4

Taste: 7

40% \* 7 = 2.8

Heat Level: 3

Cooking Time: 5 minutes

The Cuisinart waffle maker did a great job in the second version of the self-mixed recipe test. Compared to the result from the first attempt, the scores saw significant improvements. The coloring was darker than we’d prefer, but the crust wasn’t charred. And despite the texture being fairly mediocre, the waffle was flavorful, nevertheless.

#### Color (6.5/10) — 35%

*   Color tone: Very dark brown — Light gold (Both sides)
*   Color distribution: Even

The coloring was not optimal. Both sides of the waffle have a dark, toasted-looking appearance. The dark brown shading notably concentrated inside the waffle's wells and on the waffle's outer sections. Outside the wells and toward the center, the waffle has a very beautiful golden brown color.

#### Texture (5.5/10) — 25%

*   Texture: Mediocre
*   Aeration level: Low; bubbles were few and under-developed

Unfortunately, the texture was mediocre. Aeration was minimal, resulting in a fairly dense waffle that wasn’t as soft or spongy as we would have liked.

#### Taste (7/10) — 10%

*   Flavor: Tasty; creamy from the butter and sweet, slightly salty
*   Mouthfeel: Mushy due to the dense, un-aerated core

Despite the less-than-ideal coloring and texture, our chef gave the waffle a decent score. The addition of new ingredients to the recipe has fortified the waffle’s flavor profile. Alongside the usual sweetness of sugar, there was a rich, creamy taste of butter. And with one teaspoon of salt mixed in, the waffle also gained a slightly salty taste.

Overall, the WAF-F20P1 did a great job unlocking the batter's flavor profile.

### Birch Benders Mix

Taste: 10

40% \* 10 = 4.0

Heat Level: 3

Cooking Time: 5 minutes

The waffle maker performed wonderfully in our test with the Birch Benders mix. It is the first waffle maker so far to get two consecutive perfect scores from our chef. The coloration is excellent, with an evenly cooked golden-brown crust. The waffle's texture can still be improved, but ultimately very good. Taste-wise, though there were minor issues here and there (like an interior that's a bit too moist), our chef gave it a perfect score due to its great flavor and mouthfeel.

#### Color (10/10)

*   Color tone: Golden brown
*   Color distribution: Even

The coloration is one of the best we’ve seen. Thus, it got a perfect score in this section. The crust on both sides has a beautiful golden brown tone, distributed evenly across the entire waffle.

#### Texture (8.5/10)

*   Texture: Excellent
*   Aeration level: High; air bubbles were fully developed

The waffle has nicely developed. Air bubbles can be seen throughout the waffle’s core, which explains the soft and fluffy texture. Unfortunately, it is not perfect: the waffle still contains too much moisture.

#### Taste (10/10)

*   Flavor: Sweet and slightly savory
*   Mouthfeel: Soft and pliant

It is a delicious waffle with a sweet and savory flavor. The mouthfeel is excellent, with it being soft and pliant in the mouth.

Although, as previously mentioned, the texture is too moist, it didn’t affect the overall tasting experience much. Our chef was willing to overlook this detail to give the waffle a full score.

Design

*   Control Panel (10%) - **9.5**/undefined
    

Thanks to its mostly-metal construction, the design of this waffle maker is undeniably solid and aesthetically pleasing. However, certain parts have been crafted from silver-painted plastic rather than actual metal.

While the waffle plates are effective and the control panel is easy to use, there are still a few minor issues that prevent them from getting a perfect overall score.

The shipping box includes the waffle maker, the user manual and quick-start guides, and a measuring cup.

### Dimensions

Length: 15.0" (38.1 cm)

Width: 9.5" (24.1 cm)

Height: 9.0" (22.9 cm)

Weight: 12.0 lbs (5.4 kg)

Due to the double-sided design, the Cuisinart WAF-F20P1 is larger and bulkier than your average waffle maker. Additionally, because it is primarily made of metal, it’s also heavier than most, coming in at 12 pounds. Moving the waffle maker in and out of storage is difficult.

### 9.0 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl5j3gftz0003t2889dpibzws.jpg" alt="Cuisinart WAF-F20P1 Build Quality Video" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl4y0ihu5001uh388awzvh8x0.jpg" alt="A close-up view of the spring and internal mechanisms of the rotating hinges of the Cuisinart WAF-F20P1 waffle maker." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl4y143sy0029h3889ejdcnby.jpg" alt="A close-up view of the rotating hinges of the Cuisinart WAF-F20P1 Double waffle maker." width="300px" height="200px">

Build quality is good. Many of the machine’s parts are made of stainless steel, such as the lid shells. They give the machine an aesthetically-pleasing look and a luxurious shine.

However, only some parts are made from metal. The outer rim of the base, as well as the supporting legs, are made from plastic. They’re merely painted silver to mimic the look of brushed metal. Cuisinart didn’t disclose this information in the marketing spread, which has angered many customers.

### 9.5 - Waffle Plates

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl4y0j8px001vh38809cr9tle.jpg" alt="An overview of the Cuisinart WAF-F20P1’s black, Belgian-style waffle plates." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl4y14mu0002ah388580g2ynx.jpg" alt="A top-down view of the Cuisinart WAF-F20P1 waffle maker’s black, Belgian-style cooking plates." width="300px" height="200px">

Number of Plates: 4

Grid Pattern: Belgian-style

Plate Area: 36.32 inches

Plate Length: 6.8" (17.3 cm)

Plate Width: 6.8" (17.3 cm)

Material: Cast aluminum

Non Stick Coating: Yes

Removable: No

Dishwasher Safe: No

Cuisinart designed and constructed the waffle plates well. They’re made from cast aluminum and coated with a non-stick Teflon layer, similar to those found on the Cuisinart WMR-CA and the [Oster Belgian waffle maker](https://healthykitchen101.com/waffle-makers/reviews/oster/oster-belgian/).

Our temperature tests found that both sets of waffle plates heated evenly. Most of the time, they were at the same temperature. 

Unfortunately, the waffle plates aren’t removable, so they’re tricky to clean.

### 9.5 - Control Panel

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl5j3tbm40004t288a8cn4lut.jpg" alt="Cuisinart WAF-F20P1 Control Panel Video" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl4y0ju3c001wh3885kqoaced.jpg" alt="A close-up of the control panel of the Cuisinart WAF-F20P1 Double Belgian waffle maker, with the silvery browning control knob to the left and the black power switch to the right." width="300px" height="200px">

Indicator Lights: Yes

Audible Alarm: Yes

Timer: No

Browning Control: Yes

The control panel consists of a temperature knob and a power switch. Both are easy to use.

There are two indicator lights on either side of the waffle maker. These green lights (READY lights) turn on when the waffle plates have been heated to the correct temperature. This model also comes with an audible alarm, which beeps when the waffle maker is ready.

The Cuisinart WAF-F20P1 does not have a POWER indicator to show if it’s receiving power. We had to hold a hand over the warming waffle plates to confirm the machine was getting power. Not only is that a hassle, but it’s also a possible safety issue. If you’re not in a hurry, you can always wait to see if the READY lights illuminate.

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl4y0kd5d001xh38842jb2bp1.jpg" alt="A close-up of the power plug of the Cuisinart Double waffle maker WAF-F20P1’s power plug." width="300px" height="200px">

Plug Style: Type A (Flat Blade Attachment Plug)

Length: 2.6 ft (0.8 m)

Cable Management: Yes

The power cord of the Cuisinart WAF-F20P1 measures 31 inches long, which is reasonable. Underneath the base, you’ll find a pair of hooks inside a large enclosure. You can wrap the power cord around the hooks, then nestle the cord bundle into the compartment. It makes storage neater.

### Accessories: Measuring Cup

Ease of Use

usability Scores: **NaN**

*   Handling (25%) - **9.0**/undefined
    
*   Safety (40%) - **9.5**/undefined
    
*   Cleanability (25%) - **6.5**/undefined
    
*   Indicator Light Visibility (10%) - **10**/undefined
    

Handling the Cuisinart WAF-F20P1 is a breeze with its easy-to-use locking system and smooth rotating mechanism. The handy indicator lights are bright enough to help you monitor the cooking process, even under harsh lighting or far away.

Despite its excellence, this device isn't completely perfect. One shortcoming is its lack of a POWER light that would give an extra safety warning. Additionally, it can be tough to clean after each use.

### 9.0 - Handling

The lid opens and closes smoothly. An intuitive lid lock mechanism secures the lid. The lock disengages on its own when you pull the handle upward. The safety will click into place again when you close the lid.

The waffle iron section rotates smoothly and easily. However, it is heavy, so it takes a little force.

### 9.5 - Safety

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl4y0dytx001qh388cfcuffa9.jpg" alt="The temperature of the back hinges of the Cuisinart WAF-F20P1 being measured by a thermometer, which reads 234.6°F." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl4y0ev4v001rh38817hpbjwu.jpg" alt="Temperature of the front control panel of the Cuisinart WAF-F20P1 is being taken using a thermometer during a thermal safety test.

Top Side Temperature: 234°F

Bottom Side Temperature: 85°F

Handle Temperature: 105°F

The most noteworthy issue is the lack of a POWER light, which, as we mentioned earlier, is a safety risk.

Other than that, the waffle maker is safe to use. The lid is rock-solid and won’t snap down suddenly. After several cooking sessions, the handle was only warm to the touch (105°F).

The top side measures around 234°F.

Because the base is removed from the waffle maker’s body, it remains at room temperature (89°F).

### 6.5 - Cleanability

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl4y12ey80027h3885suba2tp.jpg" alt="The silver Cuisinart WAF-F20P1 with excess batter overflowing and dripping down from both sets of cooking plates on the waffle maker." width="300px" height="200px">

The Cuisinart WAF-F20P1 doesn’t come with a drip tray, so spills weren’t easy to clean up. We also found it very difficult to clean the side of the waffle maker once the batter had solidified. The batter’s grip on the metal was so firm that we had to use detergent to get it off. Even after getting the clumps off, we could still see residue.

The waffle plates were easy to clean, thanks to their non-stick layer. Cooked waffles usually slid cleanly off the plates. Leftover crumbs and debris could be quickly swept up with paper towels.

### 10 - Indicator Light Visibility

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl4y11jw20026h388h00f3i78.jpg" alt="The green READY button of the Cuisinart WAF-F20P1 is on, indicating that the plates are heated and ready to use." width="300px" height="200px">

The READY lights can be seen clearly, even under harsh studio lighting.
