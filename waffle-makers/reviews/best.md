Waffle makers aren’t exactly essential kitchen appliances. We think most people would agree that frozen or ready-made waffles are quicker and less messy than making them yourself. However, if you’re focused on the best quality and flavor, homemade is always going to be best.

And, of course, you’ll need a waffle maker in your kitchen for that.

If you’re considering getting one, our list of **the best waffle makers** might help you find the perfect match for your needs and budget.

How We Tested
-------------

During our review process, we try not to look at products from the viewpoint of professional reviewers or critics. Instead, we believe it’s best to put ourselves in your shoes and try to evaluate the products from an average user’s point of view. To best do that, we had to create a detailed, consumer-centric testing methodology.

The fruit of our work—the following testing methodology for waffle makers—is currently in its second revision. We’ve relied on it to assess two dozen waffle makers thus far.

### Performance

Each individual waffle maker may get as much as 20 hours of active testing to give us a complete picture of its quality and capability. We devote a solid 15 hours of that time to testing the cooking performance. 

So far, after half a year of continuous testing, we have produced more than a hundred waffles. We put 10 to 20 servings worth of batter through each waffle maker.

Here’s how many waffles we baked in a single test session.

#### Test Recipes

There is no way to objectively assess a waffle maker’s performance other than putting it to actual use. To that end, we feed several standardized test recipes to every machine. _Their performance scores depend entirely on the final quality of the waffles they produce_.

When we first set out to test waffle makers, we worked long and hard to land on a standardized recipe. There are many variations on the classic waffle recipe, but we needed something that was not only repeatable but which would demonstrate the differences between waffle irons. It took a lot of testing and fine-tuning.

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/clbgbl43100029t884t0p2rz3.jpg" alt="Waffle makers arranged on a table next to bowls containing flours, eggs, butter, and other ingredients for mixing waffles. Cooking tools like tongs and testing equipment such as thermometers." width="360" height="240">

Our waffle makers alongside baking ingredients and testing tools during a performance test session with our self-mixed recipe.

Our current testing criteria employ two test recipes.

The first is the **self-made recipe**. It is waffle batter that we mix from scratch. We spent several weeks experimenting with popular recipes found in cookbooks and the Internet. Our chef then fine-tuned the recipe (adjusting the proportions, adding or switching out ingredients, and so on) to suit our palette.

We view this recipe as a way to simulate the performance of the waffle maker with homemade waffle mixes.

The second recipe comes from **premade waffle mix**. We use [Birch Benders Original waffle mix](https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Pancake-Classic-Birch-Benders/dp/B0759GWQ7D/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=birch+benders+original&tag=lunagwm1-20&qid=1657695998&sr=8-5) for this portion of the tests.

Plenty of users prefer the convenience of premixed batter, so this test was just as critical as the homemade one. 

#### Performance Metrics

After developing our test recipes, our team moved on to the next stage. We needed to find the factors that contribute to a high-quality waffle.

To answer this question, we conducted dozens of tests on all the waffle makers in the lab and considered many different factors. Many potential deciding factors were unsuitable, so we eliminated all but three.

Cooking speed, for example, is too unpredictable a variable for us to use. It could be an important metric, but relies on many externalities like heating efficiency, waffle plate size, and chamber sealing. So, to simplify our calculus, we don’t score waffle makers by their speed. In the end, most users won’t be overly inconvenienced whether the waffle takes 2 minutes or 10 minutes to cook. 

Altogether, we found three metrics that we believe best reflect the quality of each waffle:

*   **Color**: A good waffle should have an evenly-shaded golden brown crust. Coloration accounts for 35% of the total performance score.
*   **Texture**: The interior of the waffle should be soft, spongy, and filled with prominent [air bubbles](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226883642_Bubble-Containing_Foods). Texture gets 25% of the total performance score.
*   **Taste**: The waffle’s flavor profile should be rich and tasty; mouthfeel should be soft and neither dry nor mushy. Taste weighs in at 40% of the total performance score

We make note of the cooking time for reference, but it isn’t scored.

### Design

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl5rvz8vt001zsf88c35ydxd9.jpg" alt="The front section of Cuisinart WAF-F20P1 double Belgian waffle maker with a rotating handle made from black plastic, green indicator light is on." width="360" height="240">

In the design section, we look into the detailing and build quality of each product.

In the design section, we assess the product’s overall design. We look at the unit's build quality and the level of care the manufacturer appears to have put into designing and constructing the waffle maker.

You can think of the design score as an indicator of the device’s durability. 

Three parts are scored in the design section: build quality (60%), waffle plates (30%), and control panel (10%).

### Ease of Use

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl5rvveug001ysf88fnb0bwpr.jpg" alt="Temperature measurement of the BLACK+DECKER WMD200B flip waffle maker’s top lid is being taken using a thermometer. The result on the thermometer reads 144.5°F." width="360" height="240">

Different surfaces of the waffle maker are measured using a thermometer. The top of the BLACK+DECKER WMD200B here reads 144.5°F

This section is all about user experience. We inspect the waffle maker to see how easy, convenient, and safe it is for the user to interact with the machine.

In all, we score four sections in the ease of use section: **handling** (25%), **safety** (40%), **cleanability** (25%), and **indicator light visibility** (10%).

This is an abridged description of our testing methodology. For further details, you can check out the complete article [how we test our waffle makers](https://healthykitchen101.com/waffle-makers/tests/).

How We Picked the Best Waffle Makers
------------------------------------

The best to buy waffle maker in our list is the one with the highest scores across the board. It should stand out from every other model. After that, we pick the highest ranking waffle maker from each sub-category. 

As new waffle makers arrive at our lab and models with better performance are found, our list will change.

Reviews of The Best Waffle Makers in 2024
-----------------------------------------

Now we’ve got our foundational knowledge and specifications in place, let’s take a look at some of the best waffle makers. See if you can find one that suits your needs in the list!

1\. Best Overall: Cuisinart WAF-F20P1 Double Waffle Maker

*   Beautiful, durable stainless steel design
*   Both sets of waffle plates heat evenly
*   Has audible alarm
*   Long power cord
*   Intuitive lid locking mechanism
*   Comes with a measuring cup

*   Mediocre performance with self-mixed recipe
*   Heavy and bulky
*   Certain parts are made of plastic
*   Lacks a POWER indicator light
*   Difficult to clean due to the lack of a drip tray

The WAF-F20P1 is among the company’s premium line-up. As a high-end model, it comes with a multitude of features that you would rarely find in cheaper models. That, combined with its high performance and luxurious design, makes the Cuisinart WAF-F20P1 our top choice as long as you have a roomy budget.

Notably, the Cuisinart WAF-F20P1 is also featured in our picks of the [best belgian waffle makers](https://healthykitchen101.com/waffle-makers/reviews/best/belgian-waffle-makers/) in 2023!

The Cuisinart WAF-F20P1 has a flippable, double-sided baking chamber. So, it can prepare two Belgian-style waffles at once, and they both come out quickly and evenly cooked. 

In our test using a self-mixed batter, the waffle maker needed only 5 minutes to finish a batch.

The most impressive thing about this best double waffle maker is its performance. It is the highest performer of all models we have reviewed. Its waffles have great coloring and texture and are all flavorful. After dozens of tests on this waffle maker, we're not exaggerating when we say that we haven't run into a bad-tasting waffle yet.

The Cuisinart WAF-F20P1's design looks and feels top-of-the-line thanks to the stainless steel baking chamber. Although the frame also looks like metal, we found it's actually made from plastic. It won't be as durable as the metal baking chamber, but it does reduce the machine's weight.

The WAF-F20P1 is heavier and bulkier than the average waffle maker. It weighs 12 pounds and measures 9 inches tall and over 15 inches long. Because of this, moving the waffle maker in and out of storage can be problematic. Cuisinart, fortunately, kept storage in mind at least enough to add a pair of cord hooks at the bottom of the unit.

All the other design and usability features of the WAF-F20P1 are great. The aluminum waffle plates have non-stick surfaces, so cleaning isn’t a huge hassle. 

The control panel at the base of the waffle maker contains a power switch and a browning setting dial. You can find an indicator light at the front of the baking chamber. The light, combined with an audible chime, will tell you when the plates are heated and ready for use.

2\. Runner-up: Hamilton Beach 26031 Waffle Maker

*   Flippable design
*   Decent performance
*   High-quality construction with a luxurious aesthetic
*   Removable and washable waffle plates
*   Very easy to clean

*   Barebones control panel
*   The spin-lock mechanism at the handle is finicky

The Hamilton Beach 26031 has all the essential features you would expect from a flip waffle maker. It has a reasonably fast cooking speed for a 7-inch waffle maker, needing only around 5 minutes to produce a serving.

Thanks to the flipping design, our Hamilton Beach 26031 test waffles were uniformly cooked on both sides. Texturally, they came out soft on the inside, though slightly mushy. The crust was crispy, but a few burnt spots were dry and bitter.

The deep-grooved waffle plates are our favorite of the Hamilton Beach 26031 features. Their size and depth allow the user to produce a very thick waffle (even by Belgian standards). The plates are removable and dishwasher-safe.

The Hamilton Beach 26031 gets a high usability score. The control panel is intuitive—just turn the browning control dial to the level of crispness that you’d like. Wait for the signal light, then pour in the batter.

While its waffles may not quite feel restaurant-quality, they're perfect for family breakfasts. Decent performance combined with an attractive and usable design makes the Hamilton Beach 26031 an appealing choice in the flip waffle maker market.

3\. Best Value: BLACK+DECKER WMB500 Waffle Maker

*   Double-sided design is useful for making multiple servings
*   Performs adequately on all performance tests
*   Solid build quality for the price
*   Easy to clean thanks to the included drip tray

*   Bulky and heavy
*   Tends to undercook the bottom of the waffle

We recommend the Black+Decker WMD200B not only for the affordable price but also for its quality. This is the model to buy if you want an inexpensive and well-built waffle maker that can deliver two waffles simultaneously. It's an especially great fit for large families.

Notably, the WMD200B is a rotating design with dual cooking plates. But while it can make two servings at once, its waffles usually don’t come out as uniform as those from other flippable designs. 

This waffle maker has a notable tendency to undercook the underside of all its waffles. No matter what recipe we use, the bottom side of the waffle is always one or two tones lighter than the top.

And while the texture of the waffles tends to be mushy, the good news is that our test waffles were almost always great in terms of flavor. So, if you’re not particular about the quality of your breakfast waffles, the Black and Decker WMD200B should also make the cut.

The WMD200B is straightforward, mainly because it has no control function. Just plug it in, wait for the signal light, and pour in the batter. The lack of control functions can be a drawback for some users since it limits the machine's flexibility.

We like the way that the waffle maker handles. The baking chamber rotates smoothly, and the push-in handle lock is very intuitive. 

The cooking plates can’t be removed, so they’re a pain to clean. Nevertheless, the non-stick coating on the plates functions well enough that we never had to deal with much debris or residue during our tests.

4\. Best Value, Belgian: BELLA 13991 Classic Waffle Maker

*   Affordable
*   Did well in both of our performance tests
*   Overall design looks very classy
*   The non-stick coating functions well

*   Poor build quality
*   The lid is dangerously loose

As one of our best-performing Belgian-style waffle makers, the Bella 13991 occupies a well-deserved spot on the list. Surprisingly, despite the high level of cooking performance and a reasonably attractive design, its pricing is still considered “budget-friendly.” So, if you’re in the market for a decent Belgian-style waffle maker, this is a good one that’s easy on the wallet.

As we mentioned earlier, the Bella gave us some of our best test performances. It produced waffles with great coloration and good texture and taste through two recipes. It was able to achieve this result in no small parts thanks to its flippable design.

The Bella waffle maker has a sharp appearance thanks to its mirror-finished stainless steel lid. The luxurious appearance belies a relatively modest price point. However, we saw many build quality issues when we looked closer at the waffle maker.

For example, the lid of the waffle maker is attached to very loose hinges. The lid rocks loosely back and forth whenever it is lifted or lowered. Worse still, when the top is pushed up, it doesn’t lean back at an angle and tends to snap shut unexpectedly. If you’re not careful, the lid can snap closed on your hand while pouring batter or trying to extract the cooked waffle.

Fortunately, most build quality issues don’t seriously affect performance or usability. The loose lid is a hassle and a safety problem, but you can just hold it open with one hand while you’re working with the machine.

Bella designed and built other parts of the waffle maker well. The waffle plates are coated with a layer of non-stick material that simplifies cleanup. The control panel at the top of the unit is easy to use.

Overall, while it is not perfect, the Bella 13991 makes good waffles and functions alright for the price.

5\. Best Small: Crownful Mini Waffle Maker (CF-WM01)

*   Does a decent job at making pre-mixed waffles
*   The waffle plates’ non-stick layer works well
*   Easy to use ‘plug-and-play’ design
*   Great cleanability

*   Unremarkable performance in the self-mixed recipe test
*   Relatively slow cooking speed
*   Thin layer of paint that can be easily scratched
*   Many safety issues

A mini-size waffle maker can be perfect if you have small children. However, kids aren’t the only ones who can enjoy the small 4-inch mini waffles. Stack a few of these waffles on a plate and add a little syrup or fruit, and you have yourself a great breakfast. These small waffles make for great mid-day snacks, too.

Does that pique your interest? If so, you’ll love the Crownful Mini Waffle Maker!

Naturally, the most distinctive part of this waffle maker is the size. It is 5.7 inches long, 5.12 inches wide, and 3.15 inches tall—small enough to fit in the palm of your hand. Its size and plastic frame makes it light. The Crownful Mini weighs a feathery 1 pound.

The small set of non-stick waffle plates measures 4 inches in diameter and turns out cute miniature waffles of agreeable quality.

Although our performance tests have shown the Crownful to have a relatively mediocre level of performance, all of the waffles it has made were perfectly edible. The coloration may not be to our liking, but it did a satisfactory job in terms of texture and taste.

The build quality is excellent for a waffle maker in this price range. The lid is made from textured plastic that looks great and feels nice to touch. We also like the lid's patterning, which resembles concentric circles.

At the center of these circles is the indicator light. It turns on when the waffle maker is plugged in and off when it is ready for use. However, besides the indicator, the Crownful doesn’t have any extra control functions. The lack of a temperature control dial hampers the waffle maker’s versatility.

Overall, the Crownful Mini’s unique size and its highly affordable price tag make it worth looking into!

6\. Best Thin: Cuisinart WMR-CA Classic Waffle Maker

*   Affordable
*   Did a great job in our test with Birch Benders mix
*   Fast cooking time (2 minutes)
*   Compact and lightweight design is easy to store

*   Poor performance on self-mixed recipe
*   Heating element is too strong and can easily burn waffles

The Cuisinart WMR-CA is a waffle iron for classic-style waffle lovers. Considering its quality, simplicity of use, and resulting golden brown waffles, this device won’t disappoint.

The Cuisinart WMR-CA, so far, is the fastest waffle maker we have tested. It can serve up a 7-inch waffle in as little as 2-4 minutes. While it didn't perform well in the test with our self-made recipe, the WMR-CA shone brightly when pitted against the Birch Benders waffle mix. Coloration was superb in this test, along with texture and taste.

There is room for improvement, but the WMR-CA performs great for the price.

The design of the WMR-CA looks and feels solid due to the top part being built from stainless steel. Its bottom half, control panel, and handle are plastic, but fortunately they’re built very well and don't affect the durability of the waffle maker.

Its compact design offers a simple solution for families with limited cooking space. Plus, the WMR-CA is nice and lightweight. 

The machine's control is intuitive and allows you to switch between 5 different temperature settings. The unit has two indicator lights: a red "POWER" light and a green "READY" light. The red shows when the unit is plugged in, and the green light will turn on when the waffle maker's plates have been properly heated.

7\. Best 4-Slice: DASH No-Drip Belgian Waffle Maker

*   Can make four small waffles at once
*   Fast cooking time (3-5 minutes)
*   Has an anti-spill design

*   Waffle quality is mediocre
*   Flimsy plastic construction
*   Lacks control panel

Need to serve up several servings of waffles at once? Your options aren’t confined to double-sided waffle makers.

Instead, give 4-slice waffle makers a shot.

The best specimen we've found so far is the DASH No-Drip Belgian waffle maker. Its most notable feature is the large set of waffle plates divided into quarters, each of which creates a 4-inch waffle. You can put waffles on the table for the entire family in the morning without wasting any time.

The DASH No-Drip does its job very quickly. Across two test recipes, the waffle maker never took longer than 5 minutes to finish cooking. The waffles' quality was mediocre, but palatable enough to be the centerpiece of family breakfasts.

Its most distinguishing feature is the massive set of waffle plates that make four 4-inch waffles at a time. Just pour in some batter, wait 3-5 minutes, and serve. 

Large trenches line either side of the plates. If you accidentally pour too much batter, the trenches will catch all the excess and save you some cleanup work. 

The design of the DASH No-Drip waffle maker is rather bare-bones. It has a plastic outer casing, which doesn't bode well for the machine's durability but does keep it cheap and reduces weight. If the casing were made from stainless steel like other 4-slice waffle makers we have seen, it would definitely exceed the DASH’s manageable 8 pounds.

Unfortunately, this model doesn’t come with any control feature. It only has a pair of indicator lights at the top. There is no temperature control dial, which is one of our biggest complaints about this model.

Nearest Competitors
-------------------

If none of the seven devices listed above suit your fancy, you can check out the other models on our list.

*   **Presto Flip-Side Waffle Maker**: Its clever design lets you effortlessly flip the baking chamber 180° using a hinge on a sturdy base. As such, this best side-flip waffle maker can save a lot of countertop space compared to flipping waffle makers, which tend to be larger.
*   **Nostalgia MWF5AQ Mini:** The Nostalgia MWF5AQ is a small and lightweight waffle maker similar to the DASH DMW001AQ. At a fraction of the DASH Mini’s price, though, it may be an appealing choice for those seeking a more budget-friendly mini waffle maker.
*   **Euro Cuisine WM520**: The Euro Cuisine WM520 is a Norwegian-style waffle maker. Its special waffle plates produce thin, heart-shaped waffles. It’s a decent option for people who wish to break away from the traditional look of Belgian or American-style waffles.
*   **Dash Mini Waffle Maker**: The Dash Mini waffle maker has a small, compact design and can turn out a bite-sized 4-inch waffle in a couple of minutes. It’s a good fit for travelers and those who want a waffle snack in the middle of the day.

Things to Keep in Mind When You Buy
-----------------------------------

Before you go through our reviews, here is all the essential information you need to know to make a good purchasing decision.

### Classic Style Waffles Or Belgian Style Waffles?

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl5rofog10012sf889cc920wf.jpg" alt="Two golden-brown samples of waffles are presented side by side, with Belgian-style waffles to the left and Classic-style waffles to the right." width="640" height="427">

Some people like [Belgian-style waffles](https://www.academia.edu/36762567/The_Waffle_and_Its_Iron_in_America) while others prefer classic-style waffles (also known as American style). They’re very different from one another.

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/waffle-makers/cl5roh71v0013sf88d6717ngf.jpg" alt="The interiors of two golden-brown waffle samples are shown side by side. The thicker Belgian-style waffle is to the left, and the thinner Classic-style waffle to the right." width="360" height="240">

In general, Belgian waffles have larger and deeper pockets that you can fill with butter, jam, cheese, bacon, or whatever toppings you crave. Plus, when made with a yeasted batter, they’re typically light and fluffy, which is not always the case with American-style ones.

You can also differentiate Belgian-style waffles from their classical siblings by their greater thickness.

Because most waffle makers can make only one style, you must decide ahead of time which you prefer. This is a great excuse to go try out different waffle dishes!

### Single-Sided vs. Double-Sided

There are two kinds of waffle makers on the market: single-sided and double-sided.

Single-sided models have one set of waffle plates and can only bake one waffle at a time. This is the more popular type and is likely the one you grew up using. It’s an excellent choice for bachelors, small families, or people who just generally don’t need to bake a lot of waffles.

On the other hand, a double-sided waffle maker has two separate sets of plates and can cook two waffles simultaneously. This unique ability makes it great for users who need to prepare large quantities of waffles, like those with large families.

Double waffle makers tend to be pricier than single-sided ones. Consider your situation carefully so you don’t end up paying extra for functionality you don’t need.

### Flippable vs. Non-Flippable

Some waffle makers have a flippable design, meaning you can flip the baking chamber upside down as it cooks.

This design will cook your waffle faster and more evenly.

The batter will spread across the bottom plate when you pour it into the waffle maker. By flipping the baking chamber, the top plate becomes the bottom, so gravity will pull more batter down to it. Both sides should end up with a similar texture. 

Direct contact with both plates results in a faster cooking time and a more evenly-cooked waffle by the end.

Non-flipping waffle makers, on the other hand, don’t rotate. They won’t give you all of the extra benefits above.

As expected, flippable waffle makers tend to be pricier than their non-flipping siblings. A waffle connoisseur, though, will consider them worth the money.

### Speed and Size

A good waffle maker should cook the batter consistently and evenly in around 5-6 minutes. The faster it achieves a crisp, golden-brown surface, the better.

In general, smaller-capacity devices will preheat and cook faster than bigger ones. Waffle iron sizes vary significantly; some span only the size of a tea saucer while others are as wide as your Roomba. Base your choice on your kitchen’s available space and the number of servings you intend to make.

### User-Friendliness

No one wants to spend more time cleaning up than actually cooking. As such, you’ll always want to look for waffle makers with [non-stick plates](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276190792_Functional_and_perceptive_aspects_of_non-stick_coatings_for_cookware) and features that enhance cleanability.

The non-stick coating will minimize cleaning hassle by preventing the batter from sticking. It also (usually) prevents your waffles from breaking apart when you remove them from the cooking plate.

Many waffle makers come with drip trays. They will sit under the machine and catch any dripping batter. You will only need to clean the tray afterward rather than the whole table.

Some models have cleanability features built right into them. For example, the Chefman waffle maker has an anti-overflow moat surrounding the plates. This moat's purpose is to catch liquid batter before it spills out of the cooking chamber.

### Price

Waffle makers can cost anywhere from $40 to over $200. The price depends mainly on the construction materials and the number of features. So, just because it's cheap doesn't necessarily mean that it's less efficient. Even a simplistic device can accomplish your main goal: making crispy golden waffles, batch after batch. 

The medium-high priced waffle irons will come with different settings that should let you choose your preferred browning level. Some also have auditory and visual indicators to inform you when the waffle iron is ready for use or when it has finished cooking.

The Best Waffle Maker Brands
----------------------------

Choosing a reputable waffle maker brand out of the dozens on the market can be hard. To make it easier for you to choose, here's a list of brands with great track records for quality!

### Cuisinart

Cuisinart has been making kitchen tools and appliances for over half a century. The company first became famous for its innovative food processors. Later, their product catalog was expanded to include other products like coffee makers, air purifiers, bread makers, and waffle makers.

Cuisinart products have a reputation for quality and performance. Their products regularly get featured in cookware and kitchen appliance magazines.

Price-wise, the company offers products in many different tiers. It has affordable models for beginners or budget-minded shoppers, such as the **Cuisinart WMR-CA classic waffle maker**. But if you’re looking for the best and have a roomy budget, Cuisinart also makes premium products that’ll be worth your time and money (hint: check the **Cuisinart WAF-F20P1 double waffle maker**).

### Hamilton Beach

Hamilton Beach is a much older company than Cuisinart. Founded in 1910, the company has over a century of experience making kitchen products. Its portfolio is diverse and includes everything from coffee grinders to electric kettles to waffle makers.

Even after a century of operation, Hamilton Beach still hasn’t lost its touch. The company maintains a reputation for quality, but the products are also known for their affordability, reliability, and value. Amateur and professional chefs alike appreciate Hamilton Beach appliances. 

The **Hamilton Beach 26031 waffle maker** received very good ratings from our reviewers.

### BLACK+DECKER

BLACK+DECKER isn’t a specialized kitchen appliance maker like Cuisinart. Instead, the company’s better known for their power tools, hand tools, and lawn and garden equipment. But perhaps that broad experience helped them land on some great kitchen designs as well! 

The company offers a wide range of culinary products, from blenders to toasters, food processors to waffle makers. Their products are generally well-regarded, with most customers citing the machines’ reliability and ease of use. This is the same assessment we made in the lab. So far, all of the products from BLACK+DECKER that we tested have held up very well.

BLACK+DECKER is an affordable brand. A good example is the **BLACK+DECKER WMD200B**, which is one of the cheapest double-sided waffle makers around.

Waffle Makers FAQs
------------------

**How to Use a Waffle Maker?**

Using a waffle maker is extremely straightforward. Plug it in, set the browning level control knob (if your model has one), wait for the READY light to pop up, then pour in the batter and shut the lid. Wait for 3-4 minutes and lift the lid to see if your waffle’s ready. If it is, just scoop it out with a pair of tongs and enjoy!

**How Long Does It Take to Cook a Waffle?**

The answer depends on the waffle maker and the temperature setting. According to our test, the average cooking time is around 5 to 6 minutes. A waffle should never take longer than 10 minutes to cook. If it does, there’s a problem.

**Is It Possible to Use Pancake Mix as a Waffle Batter?**

This is one of the tests in our performance assessment! Pancake mix has the same ingredients and consistency as waffle batter. So, when poured onto the plates, the mixture will cook like regular waffle batter. The final waffle will also look and taste like any other waffle.

Depending on the brand, you may have to add some extra ingredients if you’re going to use it for waffles. Some brands need more oil or butter. You may even have to add an egg.

Don’t worry, though. Most brands know about the dual-use potential of their pancake mix. They will have instructions on the package specifically for waffles.

**What Is the Difference Between a Waffle Maker and a Waffle Iron?**

Many people use these terms interchangeably, but they technically refer to two different kinds of waffle-making tools.

A waffle maker is a full-fledged kitchen appliance like you see above. In comparison, a [waffle iron](https://blog.library.si.edu/blog/2010/08/24/waffle-iron-patented/) consists of two waffle plates connected by a hinge. You pour batter in and then set the whole thing over a burner or coals to cook.

**Can You Use a Pancake Mix in a Waffle Maker?**

Absolutely! Many brands of pancake mix on the market (such as Birch Benders, which we used in one of our tests) can also be used as waffle batter.

The ingredients in a pancake mix are exactly the same as a waffle’s (flour, baking powder, salt, etc.) However, the actual composition may differ between a pancake and a true waffle mix. As such, the results may not taste exactly the same if you choose a pancake mix over a waffle mix, but it will work in a pinch.

Matthew Lee has been a reviewer for HealthyKitchen101 for over two years. He has handled many review projects during his tenure, including faucets, showerheads, and water softeners.

As part of the waffle maker review project, he personally tested and assessed the most recent batch of 15 waffle makers in collaboration with the Research, Testing, and Review (RTR) Team, which includes Lap Vo and Luna Regina.

It took the team more than 200+ working hours to brainstorm and finalize the details of the first waffle maker testing methodology. After that, the team worked for another week with HealthyKitchen101’s in-house chefs to settle on two waffle recipes for performance testing.

Matthew conducted hands-on testing for each model, tests which took up to two full working days to complete. In the process, he cooked 50+ waffles, with the Media Team carefully recording the process via photos and videos for later analysis.

In total, the project took over two months to go from the drafting table to first publication. Then we spent another month compiling the results and writing 18 articles for these waffle-maker reviews.
