The AGLucky HZB-12/B is a standard-sized countertop ice maker and one of the best machines we have tested. The design is very basic and some parts, like the ice basket, are generic and of low quality. However, the AGLucky managed to produce around 16 oz (454 g) of ice in 90 min with an average bullet weight of 6.3 g. The Crownful, being a smaller machine, only managed 6.9 oz (196 g) in 87 min at 4 g per bullet. Even with this understandable difference, the Crownful ice quality tended to vary a lot. On the other hand, the Crownful has a more appealing and modern design with a large clear lid, a custom-designed ice basker and scoop, and an original control panel design using icons.
