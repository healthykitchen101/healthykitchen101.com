The VivoHome and AGLucky HZB-12/B ice makers are two practically designed machines. The VivoHome has an upfront user-friendly control panel on its lid while the AGLucky has a wider view window with a raised control panel on the roof. The VivoHome, being slightly bulkier, has a wider ice basket and larger ice reservoir. Capacity performance is very similar at around 16 lbs. However, the VivoHome has produced some of the chunkiest ice bullets we have seen with an average of 7 g per bullet, sometimes reaching 8.7 g, compared to only 6.3 g for the AGLucky. In terms of waste ice produced, the VivoHome was 1% and the AGLucky 2%. Which machine to choose depends largely on the grade of ice you prefer and the design.
