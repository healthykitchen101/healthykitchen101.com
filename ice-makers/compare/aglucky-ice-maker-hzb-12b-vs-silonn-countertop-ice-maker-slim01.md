When it comes to things that really matter, the AGLucky HZB-12/B outperformed the Silonn SLIM01 with much better ice quality and output capacity. The Silonn produced 15 oz per basket within 94 min, while the AGLucky produced 16 oz in 90 min. Not only that, the AGLucky managed 6.3 g per bullet while the Silonn was only 5.6 g and bullets were sometimes more chunky than a smooth rounded shape. The Silonn, to its credit, is a better designed machine with a sturdier build quality. It also has a more spacious control panel, better lid insulation, and better internal visibility.
