The Silonn countertop ice maker and the Igloo portable ice maker are very similarly matched for size. The Igloo is a Nostalgia product retro-design with a convenient carry handle and relatively small view window. The Silonn as a more modern design with a large transparent lid and raised V-shaped control panel. These differences apart, the Silonnâ€™s performance was average to good while the Igloo was well below par. In our tests, the Silonn produced large ice bullets weighing on average 5.6 g while the Igloo only managed 3.76 g and rarely reached 4 g per bullet. The Silonn not only made better ice, but it produced ice faster and in a greater quantity, or 9.6 oz per hour versus 6.7 oz.
