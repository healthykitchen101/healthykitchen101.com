The AGLucky HZB-12/B is a standard bullet ice maker with generic-looking parts and design. It has a large view window and a raised control panel which are very user-friendly, but the ice basket is low quality. The Igloo is a slightly smaller machine with a catchy retro-design. The carry handle is convenient but the control panel lacks quality and good design. These differences aside, the AGLucky was much better at making ice while the Iglooâ€™s performance was well below standard. With the AGLucky, you get much bigger ice bullets. The hourly capacity was 10.7 oz while the Igloo was only 6.7 oz. Ice quality for the AGLucky was consistently good compared to the high percentage of waste or broken ice produced by the Igloo.
