The Silonn SLIM 01 and the Crownful are two nicely designed countertop ice makers. The Silonn has a spacious V-shaped control panel and a wide transparent lid. Other parts like the ice basket and drainage plug are generic and of lower quality. The Crownful avoids generic parts with a custom-designed ice basket, scoop, and a control panel using icons. That said, the Crownful is essentially a compact ice maker whereas the Silonn is a larger, standard-sized machine. The Silonnâ€™s performance is comparatively average compared to similar machines, although better than the Crownful. The Crownful takes longer to produce less ice, the ice quality is not as consistent, and the bullet size is smaller.
