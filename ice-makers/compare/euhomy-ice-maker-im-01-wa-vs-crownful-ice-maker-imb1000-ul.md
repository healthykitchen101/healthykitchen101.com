Both the Euhomy and Crownful avoid generic design and low-quality generic parts. The Euhomy is different for its translucent gray lid and the control panel is on the machine front. The Crownful looks more modern with the boxy lid forming part of the body front. Its control panel is unique for using icons. Compared to other standard-sized ice makers, the Euhomy’s performance is below standard producing only 8.3 oz per hour  while most other machines average around 10 oz. For a much smaller design, the Cronwnful puts out 6.9 oz. However, the Euhomy makes larger ice bullets of around 5.6 g compared to the Crownful at only 4 g. More telling is that waste ice for the Euhomy is 7.3% of the total yield while the Crownful is only 4.9% compared to a general average of around 2% for all machines.
