When comparing externals, the Silonn SLIM01 and the EUHomy IM-01-WA countertop ice makers both stand out from other ice makers. The EUHomy is made from brushed stainless steel with minimal plastic parts and thoughtful design for things like the ice basket and drainage plug. The Silonn has a wide and spacious control panel with a more open transparent design. The performance capacity of both machines was very similar producing around 14 lbs or more per 24 hrs with an average ice bullet weighing in at 5.6 g. However, the ice quality of the EUHomy was not the great with 7.3% consisting of broken or waste ice while for the Silonn the average was only 4%.
