The AGLucky HZB-12/B and the EUhomy IM-01-WA differ a lotÂ  in both design and performance. The AGLucky proved to be among our best countertop ice makers. The EUhomy, despite good design and ease-of-use, showed poor internal mechanics with rather average to poor ice making abilities. The AGLucky, on the other hand, performed well and consistently made ice bullets of 6 grams or more. It put out around 16 oz of ice within 90 min while the EUhomy did only 15.6 oz in 112 min. The EUhomy is, by comparison, a studier machine fabricated from better quality materials with superior insulation. The downside of the AGLucky is its flimsy basket and rather loose fitting lid.
