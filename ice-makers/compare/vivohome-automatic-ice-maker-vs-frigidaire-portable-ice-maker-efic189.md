The VivoHome and the Frigidaire are a close match for overall performance. The Frigidaire won out in capacity producing 11.4 oz (323 g) per hour versus 10.5 oz (298 g) for the Vivohome. The key difference being the Frigidaire was faster at producing ice while the capacity per basket was around 19 oz (550 g) or slightly above for both. If you like large and chunky ice bullets, then the VivoHome is better. It averaged 7 g per bullet, sometimes reaching 8.7 g, while the Frigidaire averaged around 6.2 g and only occasionally managed 7 g per bullet. The Frigidaire, however, has a more modern-looking and open design while the somewhat dated design of the VivoHome has a much more user-friendly control panel.
