The Frigidaire EFIC189 and the AGLucky HZB-12/B are two closely matched ice makers. Overall, the Frigidaire had the performance edge in our tests with one basket load averaging 19.6 oz in 103 min compared to AGLucky’s 16 oz in 90 min. In terms of the 24 hr capacity, the AGLucky did 16 lbs while the Frigidaire produced 17.1 lbs. The Frigidaire has a more rounded and modern design with a wider transparent lid. On the downside, the ice basket sits a little high and can trigger the Ice Full alert if not pushed down securely. On the other hand, the AGLucky was easier to clean inside since the Frigidaire’s water guard and drainage plug were a little tough to deal with.
