The Crownful and Igloo are two portable ice makers that sit in their own categories. The Crownful is smaller than the Igloo since it’s a compact machine similar in size to the AGLucky/12H. The Igloo is a Nostalgia product with a catchy retro design but still a standard-sized machine, while the Crownful stands out for its nifty modern design. These two machines are similar for the smaller size and weight of ice bullets they produce. The Igloo’s performance, however, was disappointing with bullets averaging only 3.76 g. The Crownful, despite its compact size, managed 4 g per bullet. While their overall capacities were very similar, the Crownful only produced 4.9% of waste ice compared to the 9.4% of the Igloo. We don’t recommend the Igloo, but the Crownful is not a bad option for a compact machine or for limited ice needs.
