The VivoHome automatic ice maker versus the Igloo portable ice maker is a comparison between the best of the best and the worst of the not so good. The VivoHome is one of the best ice makers we tested, especially for large and chunky ice bullets. The average weight per bullet was 7 g, sometimes reaching 8.7 g, producing 23 oz per basket or 10.5 oz per hour. The Vivohome often produced baskets containing zero ice waste. On the other hand, the Igloo struggled to produce ice bullets larger than 4 g, the overall capacity was significantly low, and waste or broken ice averaged 9.4% per basket load. The VivoHome is quite bulky compared to the Igloo, but there are other machines, such as the Silonn, which are a much better option for the size.
