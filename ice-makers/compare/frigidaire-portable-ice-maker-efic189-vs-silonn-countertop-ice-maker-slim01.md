The difference between the Frigidaire EFIC189 and the Silonn SLIM01 is between a top and averaging performing countertop ice maker. The Frigidaire has produced some of our best test results to date. Its full basket weight averaged 19.6 oz compared to the Sillon’s 15 oz. The Frigidaire’s overall capacity was significantly higher than the Sillon’s and the ice quality was better. The Frigidaire put out large bullets averaging 6.2 g, with some rounds of over 7 g, while the Silonn only averaged 5.6 g per bullet. Both machines, however, have a modern transparent design. The Frigidaire has a wider transparent lid surface and a more rounded and slanted design. The Silonn can best be appreciated for its spacious control panel while the Frigidaire design is somewhat cramped.
