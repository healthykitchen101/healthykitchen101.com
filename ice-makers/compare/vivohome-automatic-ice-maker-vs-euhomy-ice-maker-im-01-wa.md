The EUHomy ice maker impressed with its overall good design and build quality. It has a wider view lid than the VivoHome, however it is not transparent but a translucent gray color. The EUhomy avoids generic options with thoughtful design features for the ice basket, drainage plug, and a well-fitting lid. The VivoHome has a user-friendly and spacious control panel, but the lid is not so well designed for insulation. On the other hand, the VivoHome impressed with its top performance producing 10.5 oz (298 g) per hour compared to EUhomyâ€™s 8.3 oz (235 g). Ice quality for the EUhomy was below par with ice bullets averaging only 5.4 g while ice waste or broken ice was a whopping 7.3%. By comparison, the VivoHome averaged 7 g per bullet, sometimes reaching 8.7 g, and waste ice was only 1% of the total yield.
