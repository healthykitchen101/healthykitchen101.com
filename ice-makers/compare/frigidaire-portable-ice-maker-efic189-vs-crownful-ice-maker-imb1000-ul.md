The Frigidaire EFIC189 and the Crownful are two very modern-looking countertop ice makers. Both maximize transparency with their lid design, and both avoid low quality generic parts. The larger Frigidaire is more rounded whereas the Crownful has a compact box-shaped design. The Crownful pays more attention to small design features, however, neither machine has the best design for a control panel. Performance wise, the Frigidaire produced consistently good quality ice whereas the Crownfulâ€™s quality varied. Understandably, the Frigidaire is a larger capacity machine and the bullet size is much larger. The Crownful, nonetheless, is our best recommendation for a compact machine.
