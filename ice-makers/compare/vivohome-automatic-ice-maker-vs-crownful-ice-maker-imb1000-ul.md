The Vivohome automatic ice maker and the Crownful are actually two different classes of countertop ice makers. Both are essentially portable machines, but they serve different needs. The Crownful is a small and compact machine with a modern design whereas the Vivohome is somewhat bulky and dated in its design. That said, the VivoHome produced some of the chunkiest ice bullets we have seen and had the best overall consistency for ice quality. VivoHome ice bullets averaged 7 g per bullet, sometimes reaching as much as 8.7 g. On the other hand, the Crownful average only 4 g per bullet with 4.9% waste ice compared to only 1% for the VivoHome. The Crownful also took longer to produce ice, but its small and nifty design may suit people who prefer smaller ice bullets with less need for high capacity performance.
