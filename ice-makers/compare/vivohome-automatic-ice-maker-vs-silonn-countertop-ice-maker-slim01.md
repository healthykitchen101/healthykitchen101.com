Both the Vivohome automatic ice maker and the Silonn SLIM01 are distinctive for their user-friendly control panel design. The Vivohome is unusual for having its control panel on the front of the lid. The Silonn also has a spacious control panel but on the roof of the machine. The Vivohome has a larger water reservoir and more spacious basket and it produced 10.5 oz (289 g) of ice per hour whereas the Silonn managed 9.6 oz (273 g). Overall capacity for the Vivohome was 15.9 lbs compared to 14 lbs for the Silonn. The key difference, however, was with ice quality. The Vivohome has produced some of the best quality ice bullets with an average weight of 7 g per bullet and only 1% waste ice compared to only 5.6 g for the Silonn with 4% waste ice.
