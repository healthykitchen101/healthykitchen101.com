The Frigidaire EFIC189 and EUHomy IM-01-WA are two quite different looking ice makers. The Frigidaire has a wide transparent lid surface with a smallish control panel at the rear. In contrast, the EUHomy has a translucent lid with low internal visibility and a user-friendly control panel on the front of the machine. Design differences aside, the Frigidaire produced 19.6 oz of ice in 103 min while the EUHomy only put out 15.6 oz in 112 min. Likewise, the Frigidaire produced perfectly formed ice bullets averaging 6.2 g per bullet while the EUHomy bullets were only 5.6 g per bullet. In addition to better performance, the Frigidaire has a much larger water reservoir of 2.2 liters (2.3 qt) compared to 1.6 liters (1.7 qt) for the EUHomy.
