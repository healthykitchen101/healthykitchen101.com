The Frigidair has a rounded modern-looking design with a wide transparent view window. Its drawback is a rather small control panel at the rear of the roof. The Igloo sports a retro Nostalgia design with a convenient carry handle and small view window. Looks aside, the Frigidaire completely outpaced the Igloo in the ice making ranks. The Frigidaire put out hefty ice bullets of 6.2 g on average and managed 11.4 oz per hour versus 6.7 oz for the Igloo. Additionally, the Frigidaire produced 1.8% waste or broken ice per basket load while the Igloo was a whopping 9.4%. The Frigidaire strikes the balance between good design and performance excellence.
