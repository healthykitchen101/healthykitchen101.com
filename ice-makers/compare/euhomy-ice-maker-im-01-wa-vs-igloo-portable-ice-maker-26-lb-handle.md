The EUHomy is a well-built machine which avoids generic parts and designs. The control panel is on the front of the machine, and the lid is a translucent gray color. The Igloo is a little smaller and lighter and sports a Nostalgia retro design. It has a nifty carry handle and a small view window, but the control panel is not the best quality. Both machines donâ€™t produce the best quality ice, but the EUhomy is the better choice. Its capacity per hour was 8.3 oz producing 15.6 oz per basket in 112 min. The Igloo only managed 6.7 oz per hour and it took 134 min to produce 15 oz per basket. The percentage of waste or broken ice was high for both, 7.3% for the Euhomy and 9.4% for the Igloo.
