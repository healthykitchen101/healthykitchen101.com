The Igloo 26 lbs pound portable ice maker with a handle is a retro-type design also featured in the Nostalgia brand product range. We liked the design concept and look of this ice maker but, when put to the test, its performance was rather lackluster. Ice making was slow and it took a long time for the ice bullets to get to a decent weight. In fact, most ice bullets weighed in at less than 4 grams. Although the net basket capacity was not bad, the percentage of waste or broken ice was high. Unless you really like the retro design, you may want to think about giving this countertop ice maker a skip.

In terms of comparative size, this Nostalgia Igloo is not exactly a compact or small machine. It is similar in size to the [Silonn ice maker](https://healthykitchen101.com/ice-makers/reviews/silonn/silonn-countertop-ice-maker-slim01/), but its performance ranks lower than a true compact machine like the Crownful. The quality of ice tended to vary a lot from batch to batch. While the basket capacity was comparable by weight, the time to fill one basket was comparatively long, taking more than 2 hours.

### Ice Capacity Test

Average Time Basket: 134 min

Average Weight Basket: 15 oz (424 g)

Average Waste Basket: 1.41 oz (40 g)

Capacity Hr: 6.7 oz (190 g)

Capacity24 Hrs: 10.1 lbs (4.6 kg)

Since the Igloo is a similar-sized machine to both the Silonn and the [AGLucky HZB-12/B](https://healthykitchen101.com/ice-makers/reviews/aglucky/aglucky-ice-maker-hzb-12b/), the average basket capacity or weight per load is much the same. On average, a basket filled to 424 g, however, the average time per basket was 134 min. This compared poorly to 90 min and 94 min for its two closest competitors. Therefore, the overall 24 hr capacity only reached 4.6 kg, well below the stated 26 lbs or 12 kg. The compact Crownful managed 4.7 kg but within 87 min per load. All said and done, the Igloo is not really a machine we recommend.

### Ice Quality Test

Average Weight Bullet: 0.13 oz (3.8 g)

Ice making cycles with the Igloo varied a lot and the machine took comparatively long to settle into a good working rhythm. The average weight per bullet was only 3.8 g, so well below the expected 5 grams and only periodically reaching 4 grams or more. Additionally, the amount of broken or insubstantially formed ice was 40 g per load, or roughly 9.4%. This was the highest recorded of any machine with 2% or less being the best average and 4% a medial average.

There are a few thoughtful features on this machine. One is the convenient carry handle, the ice basket has a raised edge, and the reservoir is nicely designed to maximize the water volume. The control panel is clearly worded using no abbreviations, but we had doubts about the material quality and it seemed a little cramped.

### In The Box

*   One ice maker
*   Removable ice basket
*   Ice scoop
*   User manual
*   Customer service card

The Igloo countertop ice maker came neatly boxed between styrofoam padding. There was also additional protection for the corners, and the packaging was more secure than average. The customer service card includes a thank you note, contact numbers, and a 5% discount coupon for your next purchase.

### Dimensions

Width: 8.5" (21.6 cm)

Depth: 12.5" (31.8 cm)

Height: 12.0" (30.5 cm)

Weight: 18.0 lbs (8.2 kg)

### 8.2 - Build Quality

The Igloo overall is well-built for a lightweight, plastic-bodied ice maker. The body is a bit bendy in parts but appears solid with good quality joinings and ventilation on both sides and the rear. We found the lid closed very tightly and the basket was a solid hard plastic. The small silicone drainage plug, although a minor part, was one of the nicest we had encountered.

### 7.1 - Lid

Material: Plastic

The first thing we noticed about the lid on the Igloo were the secure lid joinings. On many machines, such as the VivoHome, there are small gaps along the hinge which results in lower quality ice preservation. Our overnight ice test, however, showed the Igloo to be only slightly above average with ice preservation.

### 6.8 - Panel Design

Buttons: On/Off Clean; Select

Power Indicator: Yes

Ice Full Indicator: Yes

Add Water Indicator: Yes

IceS Indicator: Yes

IceL Indicator: Yes

One thing we didn’t really like on the Igloo was the overall design and questionable quality of the control panel. The strip design of the panel appeared not to be so secure. The buttons and indicators, however, worked perfectly fine during our tests.

On the other hand, we liked how the two buttons are separated to opposite ends of the strip. Also, indicators do not use abbreviations, including an additional ‘Clean’ indicator, so it is easy to understand.

### 8.8 - Ice Basket

Length: 7.4" (18.8 cm)

Height: 4.5" (11.4 cm)

Depth: 4.3" (10.9 cm)

Material: Hardish plastic

The ice basket is white and made of a hard plastic which is more supportive of scooping than the softer flexible type. It’s fairly deep and has a raised left corner to help with scooping the last bullets. The reservoir and basket are well designed to maximize the volume of both. The only generic looking part was the ice scoop.
