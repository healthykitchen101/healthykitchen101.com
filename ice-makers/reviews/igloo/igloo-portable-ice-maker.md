The Igloo 26 lbs pound portable ice maker with a handle is a retro-type design also featured in the Nostalgia brand product range. We liked the design concept and look of this ice maker but, when put to the test, its performance was rather lackluster. Ice making was slow and it took a long time for the ice bullets to get to a decent weight. In fact, most ice bullets weighed in at less than 4 grams. Although the net basket capacity was not bad, the percentage of waste or broken ice was high. Unless you really like the retro design, you may want to think about giving this countertop ice maker a skip.
