The Igloo 26 lbs pound portable ice maker with a handle is a retro-type design also featured in the Nostalgia brand product range. We liked the design concept and look of this ice maker but, when put to the test, its performance was rather lackluster. Ice making was slow and it took a long time for the ice bullets to get to a decent weight. In fact, most ice bullets weighed in at less than 4 grams. Although the net basket capacity was not bad, the percentage of waste or broken ice was high. Unless you really like the retro design, you may want to think about giving this countertop ice maker a skip.

**Things We Like**

In terms of comparative size, this Nostalgia Igloo is not exactly a compact or small machine. It is similar in size to the [Silonn ice maker](https://healthykitchen101.com/ice-makers/reviews/silonn/silonn-countertop-ice-maker-slim01/), but its performance ranks lower than a true compact machine like the Crownful. The quality of ice tended to vary a lot from batch to batch. While the basket capacity was comparable by weight, the time to fill one basket was comparatively long, taking more than 2 hours.

### Ice Capacity Test

Average Time Basket: 134 min

Average Weight Basket: 15 oz (424 g)

Average Waste Basket: 1.41 oz (40 g)

Capacity Hr: 6.7 oz (190 g)

Capacity24 Hrs: 10.1 lbs (4.6 kg)

Since the Igloo is a similar-sized machine to both the Silonn and the [AGLucky HZB-12/B](https://healthykitchen101.com/ice-makers/reviews/aglucky/aglucky-ice-maker-hzb-12b/), the average basket capacity or weight per load is much the same. On average, a basket filled to 424 g, however, the average time per basket was 134 min. This compared poorly to 90 min and 94 min for its two closest competitors. Therefore, the overall 24 hr capacity only reached 4.6 kg, well below the stated 26 lbs or 12 kg. The compact Crownful managed 4.7 kg but within 87 min per load. All said and done, the Igloo is not really a machine we recommend.

Average Weight Bullet: 0.13 oz (3.8 g)

Ice making cycles with the Igloo varied a lot and the machine took comparatively long to settle into a good working rhythm. The average weight per bullet was only 3.8 g, so well below the expected 5 grams and only periodically reaching 4 grams or more. Additionally, the amount of broken or insubstantially formed ice was 40 g per load, or roughly 9.4%. This was the highest recorded of any machine with 2% or less being the best average and 4% a medial average.

There are a few thoughtful features on this machine. One is the convenient carry handle, the ice basket has a raised edge, and the reservoir is nicely designed to maximize the water volume. The control panel is clearly worded using no abbreviations, but we had doubts about the material quality and it seemed a little cramped.

The Igloo countertop ice maker came neatly boxed between styrofoam padding. There was also additional protection for the corners, and the packaging was more secure than average. The customer service card includes a thank you note, contact numbers, and a 5% discount coupon for your next purchase.

### 8.2 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/build-quality-clsvhnlc6001bk2882zf983y6.jpg" alt="A close up side view of a portable ice maker with two rows of ice makers on a shelf in the background." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/build-quality-1-clsvhnlo1001dk288gk3fe9u0.jpg" alt="Under view of a countertop ice maker." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/build-quality-2-clsvhnli0001ck288acndgtpq.jpg" alt="Close up view of an air vent on a portable countertop ice maker.Close up view of an air vent on a portable countertop ice maker." width="300px" height="200px">

The Igloo overall is well-built for a lightweight, plastic-bodied ice maker. The body is a bit bendy in parts but appears solid with good quality joinings and ventilation on both sides and the rear. We found the lid closed very tightly and the basket was a solid hard plastic. The small silicone drainage plug, although a minor part, was one of the nicest we had encountered.

### 7.1 - Lid

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/igloo-ice-maker-lid-clsvhuuqe001ek288blvh8yuh.jpg" alt="A top down view of a countertop ice maker with ice seen through the transparent lid" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/igloo-ice-maker-lid-1-clsvhuuvf001fk288fjpvg16e.jpg" alt="A close up of the underside of an opened lid on a countertop ice maker." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic

The first thing we noticed about the lid on the Igloo were the secure lid joinings. On many machines, such as the VivoHome, there are small gaps along the hinge which results in lower quality ice preservation. Our overnight ice test, however, showed the Igloo to be only slightly above average with ice preservation.

### 6.8 - Panel Design

Buttons: On/Off Clean; Select

Power Indicator: Yes

Ice Full Indicator: Yes

Add Water Indicator: Yes

IceS Indicator: Yes

IceL Indicator: Yes

One thing we didn’t really like on the Igloo was the overall design and questionable quality of the control panel. The strip design of the panel appeared not to be so secure. The buttons and indicators, however, worked perfectly fine during our tests.

On the other hand, we liked how the two buttons are separated to opposite ends of the strip. Also, indicators do not use abbreviations, including an additional ‘Clean’ indicator, so it is easy to understand.

### 8.8 - Ice Basket

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/igloo-ice-maker-ice-basket-clsvifzx6001jk288cry625id.jpg" alt="An empty ice basket being held up in front of a portable ice maker." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 7.4" (18.8 cm)

Height: 4.5" (11.4 cm)

Depth: 4.3" (10.9 cm)

Material: Hardish plastic

The ice basket is white and made of a hard plastic which is more supportive of scooping than the softer flexible type. It’s fairly deep and has a raised left corner to help with scooping the last bullets. The reservoir and basket are well designed to maximize the volume of both. The only generic looking part was the ice scoop.

### Water Reservoir

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/igloo-ice-maker-water-reservoir-clsvih6df001lk2886wu09cpf.jpg" alt="A top down view of a portable ice maker with the lid open and the removable ice basket resting at the side of the machine. " width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/igloo-ice-maker-water-reservoir-1-clsvih66w001kk28829tbbbnk.jpg" alt="A close up of the water reservoir of a portable ice maker." width="300px" height="200px">

Capacity: 1.6 qt (1.5 L)

The water reservoir is only 1.5 liters while larger machines like the [Frigidaire EFIC 189](https://healthykitchen101.com/ice-makers/reviews/frigidaire/frigidaire-portable-ice-maker-efic189/) or the Vivo Home both hold just over 2 liters. Still, 1.5 liters is enough water to last about three full baskets or more.

### Drainage Plug

Material: Silicone

Although a minor feature, the drainage plug on the Igloo is one of the nicest we have encountered. It’s all silicone so soft and comfortable to work with. The tether doesn’t hook over the edge of the machine, but at the same time it doesn’t get in the way of water draining out.

### Ice Scoop

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/igloo-ice-maker-ice-scoop-clsvincq7001mk288dmf971rg.jpg" alt="The ice scoop of a portable ice maker." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Hard plastic

### Cord and Plug

Length: 6.1 ft. (185 cm)

Plug Type: 3-pronged

The Igloo has a white cord to match its color scheme, but at 6.1 ft or 73 inches, you get around 2 inches longer than the standard 71 inches. If you’re stretched for space, this may be a bonus. The plug is earthed, which means it has three pronged.

Usability

We liked the carry handle on the Igloo and found the basket to be well-sized. The control panel was easy to understand, but it had a couple of drawbacks. For cleaning, the water guard was a little tough to remove and the body can scratch easily. On the upside, this Igloo was one of the quieter machines we have tested.

### 6.8 - Ease of Use

For our ease of use evaluation, we look at the control panel, visibility into the machine, and ice scooping. The Igloo control panel is clearly worded in text, but we found the design a bit cramped, the quality of the printed sheet not so great, and the button traction not the best. The retro design means a smaller view window, but the basket is well-sized.

### 8.4 - Noise

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/igloo-ice-maker-noise-clsvgx5700013k288cjq0b2q9.jpg" alt="A sound meter showing 66.3 dB standing next to the air vent of a portable countertop ice maker." width="300px" height="200px">

Decibels: 66.3 dB

Although most portable ice makers we have tested produce very little noise, the Igloo proved to be one of the quieter machines. Only the compact Crownful was quieter. This Igloo measured only 66.3 dB or on average a decibel or so lower than most other ice makers.

### 8.7 - Cleaning

Self Cleaning: Yes

Like any other portable bullet ice maker, cleaning is fairly straightforward. On this machine, the water guard doesn’t come out easily, so it’s best to use a flat screwdriver to gently pry it out from behind. 

Wiping around the tank is easy enough and the drainage plug is made from a nice soft silicone. After some extended use, we noticed that the body tends to scratch easily. The boxy, compact design doesn’t make it so easy to see the ice rods or evaporators in case of troubleshooting, but if you bend over the view is good enough.
