A portable ice maker has a built-in water reservoir and therefore no need for an inlet water line. The most popular of these countertop ice machines make bullet-shaped ice. Bullet ice makers are an affordable and fast way to make ice and most machines put out small and large ice bullets. They are easy to use and to keep clean while also quiet to run.

How We Test Countertop Ice Makers
---------------------------------

Most portable bullet ice makers claim to make up to 26 lbs or 12 kg of ice in one day. We have never substantiated such claims since there are many variables that can affect the working rhythm and quality of ice your machine makes.

Our ice capacity test focuses on practical concerns that affect users.

1.  We prep machines by running them **overnight**.
2.  The tanks are refilled with **slightly chilled water**.
3.  We assess **3 consecutive rounds** of large ice bullet making.

From this, we calculate the average time it takes to fill a basket, how much ice you get per basket, the ice capacity per hour, and how much ice you can expect over 24 hours.

For our ice quality test, we run the machines from start up timing and separately weighing each round of ice making. All our tests use zero TDS filtered water.

We see how long it takes a machine to start making ice bullets with a net weight of over 5 grams while running some 15 to 20 ice-making cycles. A decent machine usually takes 5 to 8 rounds of ice making to get a consistent net bullet weight of 5 to 7 grams.

How We Rate Countertop Bullet Ice Makers
----------------------------------------

Apart from the data driven tests above, we also monitor ice makers for the noise they make. As part of our overall rating system, we evaluate various key aspects of design and how this impacts **user-friendliness**.

We pay careful attention to **visibility** into machines for easy-of-use and effective troubleshooting. We rate machines for build quality, control panels for **user-centered** design, and ice baskets for effective scooping. We also run machines overnight to test **lid insulation**.

How We Select Products to Test
------------------------------

While testing popular machines is always important, we also select machines based on unique features, and try to test a range of machines suited to different needs or circumstances. In this way, you will know if the most popular countertop ice makers are really worth it, and what the other good picks are.

Things That Affect Good Ice Makin
---------------------------------

Regardless of what portable ice maker you buy, there are a few things that will affect the quality of your ice and your machine’s production capacity. 

*   For clear-looking ice and to extend the lifespan of your machine, use filtered water, distilled water, or [zero TDS water](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-filters/reviews/zerowater/zerowater-pitcher-23-cup/).
*   Refill using chilled (filtered) water of around 10℃ (50℉) to maintain consistent ice bullet weight and production capacity.
*   Run your ice maker away from direct sunlight and with a room temperature of 10‒32 ℃ (50‒90℉).

Reviews of the Best Portable Bullet Ice Makers in 2023
------------------------------------------------------

Here are our picks for the best countertop ice makers tested and evaluated in our lab. For more detailed information, follow the link at the end of each review.

1\. Best Overall: Frigidaire EFIC189 Portable Ice Maker

*   Performance
*   Production capacity
*   Internal visibility
*   Firm ice basket
*   Good insulation
*   Easy to clean exterior

*   Ice basket fit
*   Drainage plug

The Frigidaire ice maker is an all-round excellent machine. Good design and build quality is matched to both consistent high ice quality and top production capacity.

The Frigidaire took a little longer than most other machines to fill a basket of ice, but it was one of the few machines that averaged over 18 oz or 500 g (**555g** exact) of quality ice per basket. It produced 11.4 oz (323 g) of ice per hour and one basket took around **103 minutes**.

Not only that, the average weight per large ice bullet was **6.2 g**, which was really good and occasionally it managed to put out bullets of 7 grams. The amount of waste or broken ice produced was only an average of 1.8% of net basket weight. Overall, the machine should produce about **17 lbs or 7.8 kg** of ice per 24 hours.

While some machines such as the AGLucky HZB-12/B produced chunkier and heavier ice, the Frigidaire had the overall best consistency in terms of quantity and quality.

The Frigidaire EFIC 189 has a rounded rather than boxy design with high interior visibility. However, we found the control panel a bit cramped at the rear end of the machine, and the lid joinings were not so good. For keeping and serving ice throughout the day, the lid insulation was one of the poorer designs we tested.

2\. Best for Ice Quality: AGLucky HZB-12/B Ice Maker

*   Overall performance
*   Ice quality
*   Raised control panel

*   Flimsy ice basket
*   Internal visibility

The AGLucky HZB-12/B proved to be an excellent machine for chunky, quality ice. The average ice bullet weight was around **6.3 grams** and waste ice a neat 2% of the basket total. This gave it a slight edge over the Frigidaire.

The time to fill a basket was only **90 minutes**. With a slightly smaller basket compared to its close rival, this AGLucky only managed around **16 oz** (456 g) per basket or around 10.7 oz (304 g) per hour and the net capacity per 24 hours worked out at **16 lbs** or **7.3 kg**.

We really liked the raised control panel, but a few design issues detracted from its great performance. For one, the generic ice basket is rather flimsy. More importantly though, for serving ice throughout the day, the lid did not rank the best in terms of insulation.

3\. Best Tech and Color Line-Up: Silonn SLIM01 Countertop Ice Maker

*   Stainless steel body
*   Large transparent lid
*   Spacious panel

*   Flimsy basket
*   Basket design

The Silonn is at best an average performing machine, but it has a couple of nice design features and is available in a variety of colors. We tested the stainless steel body model, but you can get identical plastic-bodied machines in black, teal, red, silver, and white. There is also a model that uses a **smart app** for an additional user interface.

The average weight per basket was an average low of only **15 oz (427 g)**, but the time per cycle was relatively good at **94 min** and the hourly capacity (9.6 oz / 273 g) was somewhat better than a few other machines.

Overall, this machine produced good chunky ice bullets with an average weight of **5.6 g**. However, the bullers were not always smoothly shaped and sometimes came out looking like spent slugs rather than slender bullets.

Regardless, the Silonn has a refreshing and spacious design for its control panel and we also liked the large view window. The ice basket is very generic, made from a lower quality type of plastic, and identical to the AGLucky.

If you like the color choice, it’s not a bad machine. Also, not many portable ice makers have a model with [a smart app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smart.life.regineer&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1) which can be used to set a timer, select ice bullet size, run auto clean, and get status notifications.
