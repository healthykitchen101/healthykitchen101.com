Two bullet ice makers getting readied for testing

Most portable bullet ice makers claim to make up to 26 lbs or 12 kg of ice in one day. We have never substantiated such claims since there are many variables that can affect the working rhythm of an ice machine and its ice quality.

Our [ice capacity test](https://healthykitchen101.com/ice-makers/tests/bullet/ice-capacity/) focuses on practical concerns that affect users.

1.  We prep machines by running them **overnight**.
2.  The tanks are refilled with **slightly chilled water**.
3.  We assess **3 consecutive rounds** of large ice bullet making.

From this, we calculate the average time it takes to fill a basket, how much ice you get per basket, the ice capacity per hour, and how much ice you can expect over 24 hours.

For our [ice quality test](https://healthykitchen101.com/ice-makers/tests/bullet/ice-quality/), we run the machines from start up, timing and separately weighing each round of ice making. All our tests use zero TDS filtered water.

We see how long it takes a machine to produce ice bullets of a consistent weight. Most machines stabilize to a net weight of 5 grams or more. A decent machine usually takes 5 to 8 rounds of ice making to stabilize and we run our test for 15 to 20 rounds.

How We Rate
-----------

Apart from the data driven tests above, we also monitor ice makers for the noise they make. As part of our overall rating system, we evaluate various key aspects of design and how this impacts **user-friendliness**.

We pay careful attention to **visibility** into machines for easy-of-use and effective troubleshooting. We rate machines for build quality, control panels for **user-centered** design, and ice baskets for **effective scooping**. We also run machines overnight to test **lid insulation**.

Reviews of the Best Portable Bullet Ice Makers in 2024
------------------------------------------------------

Here are our picks for the best countertop ice makers tested and evaluated in our lab. For more detailed information, follow the link at the end of each review.

1\. Best Overall: Frigidaire EFIC189 Portable Ice Maker

*   Performance
*   Production capacity
*   Internal visibility
*   Firm ice basket
*   Good insulation
*   Easy to clean exterior

*   Ice basket fit
*   Drainage plug

The Frigidaire ice maker is an all-round excellent machine. Good design and build quality is matched to both consistent high ice quality and top production capacity.

The Frigidaire took a little longer than most other machines to fill a basket of ice, but it was one of the few machines that averaged over 18 oz or 500 g (**555g** exact) of quality ice per basket. It produced 11.4 oz (323 g) of ice per hour and one basket took around **103 minutes**.\[52\] Frigidaire Portable Ice Maker Good Capacity 1

Not only that, the average weight per large ice bullet was **6.2 g**, which was really good and occasionally it managed to put out bullets of 7 grams. The amount of waste or broken ice produced was only an average of 1.8% of net basket weight. Overall, the machine should produce about **17 lbs or 7.8 kg** of ice per 24 hours.

While some machines such as the AGLucky HZB-12/B produced chunkier and heavier ice, the Frigidaire had the overall best consistency in terms of quantity and quality.

The Frigidaire EFIC 189 has a rounded rather than boxy design with high interior visibility. However, we found the control panel a bit cramped at the rear end of the machine, and the lid joinings were not so good. For keeping and serving ice throughout the day, the lid insulation was one of the poorer designs we tested.

2\. Best for Ice Quality: AGLucky HZB-12/B Ice Maker

*   Overall performance
*   Ice quality
*   Raised control panel

*   Flimsy ice basket
*   Internal visibility

The AGLucky HZB-12/B proved to be an excellent machine for chunky, quality ice. The average ice bullet weight was around **6.3 grams** and waste ice a neat 2% of the basket total. This gave it a slight edge over the Frigidaire.\[148\] AGLucky HZB-12/B Ice Maker - Best for Superior Ice Quality

The time to fill a basket was only **90 minutes**. With a slightly smaller basket compared to its close rival, this AGLucky only managed around **16 oz** (456 g) per basket or around 10.7 oz (304 g) per hour and the net capacity per 24 hours worked out at **16 lbs** or **7.3 kg**.

We really liked the raised control panel, but a few design issues detracted from its great performance. For one, the generic ice basket is rather flimsy. More importantly though, for serving ice throughout the day, the lid did not rank the best in terms of insulation.

3\. Best Tech and Color Line-Up: Silonn SLIM01 Countertop Ice Maker

*   Stainless steel body
*   Large transparent lid
*   Spacious panel

*   Flimsy basket
*   Basket design

The Silonn is at best an average performing machine, but it has a couple of nice design features and is available in a variety of colors. We tested the stainless steel body model, but you can get identical plastic-bodied machines in black, teal, red, silver, and white. There is also a model that uses a **smart app** for an additional user interface.

The average weight per basket was an average low of only **15 oz (427 g)**, but the time per cycle was relatively good at **94 min** and the hourly capacity (9.6 oz / 273 g) was somewhat better than a few other machines.\[21\] Silonn Countertop Ice Maker Ice Capacity

Overall, this machine produced good chunky ice bullets with an average weight of **5.6 g**. However, the bullers were not always smoothly shaped and sometimes came out looking like spent slugs rather than slender bullets.

Regardless, the Silonn has a refreshing and spacious design for its control panel and we also liked the large view window. The ice basket is very generic, made from a lower quality type of plastic, and identical to the AGLucky.

If you like the color choice, it’s not a bad machine. Also, not many portable ice makers have a model with [a smart app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smart.life.regineer&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1) which can be used to set a timer, select ice bullet size, run auto clean, and get status notifications.

Things That Affect Good Ice Makin

Regardless of what portable ice maker you buy, there are a few things that will affect the quality of your ice and your machine’s production capacity. 

*   For clear-looking ice and to extend the lifespan of your machine, use filtered water, distilled water, or [zero TDS water](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-filters/reviews/zerowater/zerowater-pitcher-23-cup/).
*   Refill using chilled (filtered) water of around 10℃ (50℉) to maintain consistent ice bullet weight and production capacity.
*   Run your ice maker away from direct sunlight and with a room temperature of 10‒32 ℃ (50‒90℉).

What is a portable countertop ice maker? 
-----------------------------------------

A portable countertop ice maker has an internal water tank or holding reservoir. This means it does not need an in-line water connection. Therefore, you can place them anywhere—in your kitchen, in a pantry, or even an RV home.

Some portable ice-makers can also include the option of an in-line water connection. These ice makers tend to be for making pebble or nugget ice. They are often more expensive and may have built-in refrigerated ice storage.

What kinds of ice can a countertop ice maker produce? 
------------------------------------------------------

A portable ice maker will generally only make one type of ice. Bullet ice makers are more affordable and usually include the option of small and large bullet sizes. However, many people prefer pellet or nugget ice, and a few portable machines can make ice cubes.

**Large ice bullets:**

*   Between 5 and 7 grams.
*   Best for ice teas, smoothies, sodas, and similar beverages.

**Small ice bullets:** 

*   Between 2 and 5 grams.
*   Best of ice beds for seafood, beer, or other beverage containers.

**Nugget ice:** 

*   Easily chewable.
*   Absorbs beverage flavors.
*   Best ice for cocktails, smoothies, teas, and more.
*   Can be used for ice beds for seafood and beverage containers.

**Cube Ice:** 

*   Similar to ice made in traditional ice trays.
*   Preferred for some types of beverages.

Often, the key choice is whether to go with a countertop bullet ice maker or a nugget ice maker. This handy comparison table can help you understand the choice better:

| Bullet Ice | Nugget Ice |
| --- | --- |
| Usually only portable. | Portable and / or uses a water-line. |
| Usually no freezer compartment. | Usually has a freezer compartment. |
| More affordable. | Pricier. |
| Small and large bullets. | Small sized nuggets. |
| Good for ice teas, smoothies, sodas. | Good for most drinks, esp. cocktails. |
| More versatile than ice cubes. | Chewable and absorb beverage flavor. |
| Small bullets can be used for ice beds. | Suitable for ice beds. |

Troubleshooting Your Portable Bullet Ice Maker
----------------------------------------------

Portable ice makers, as convenient as they are, can be temperamental! Here are a few common issues we came across during testing, and tips to keep the ice flowing.

**1\. Why are my Ice bullets so small?**

If the (large) ice bullets continually come out too small (<5g average) the problem could be the machine isn’t selecting the correct ice type even though you select large. Remember, it usually takes around 8 cycles to reach 5g or more.

**Solution:** Hold down the start button to run the self-cleaning function. This will flush the system and probably clear the settings. Switch the machine off for about 3 minutes and then restart.

**2\. Why does my ice maker say ‘FULL’ when it’s not?**

Sometimes the FULL alert will display, but the ice basket is not full. This could be due to the fit of the ice basket or other interference with the infrared sensors. 

**Solution:** Make sure the ice basket is secure by pressing it down more firmly into place. Wipe the sensors to remove any mineral deposits and check to see if light refraction isn’t affecting the interior of the machine.

**3\. Why does my ice maker say ‘ADD WATER’ when there is water?**

A more common problem we encountered was the ADD WATER alert popping on even though the tank had enough water. There could be a number of reasons for this such as maybe an air blockage or dirt in the system.

**Solution:** Usually, if you long-press the start button to run the self-cleaning function the problem will sort itself out. An additional trick is to drain some water out the machine and the pressure could move the air block. Failing this, we fixed one ice maker by cleaning the machine with a solution of white vinegar and water. Grime under the water guard could also be an issue.

**4\. Why does it take so long to make ice (often poor quality)?**

There could be an ice blockage in the system. Sometimes this is a result of the water being too cold and / or the room temperature too low. Alternatively, it could mean you have a problem with the ice making coolant.

**Solution:** Switch off the machine for at least an hour to melt any ice that may be trapped and then restart using fresh water. Use water of over 15℃, lower your room temperature, or place the machine in a cooler location.

**5\. Why is my ice always so cloudy?**

This has nothing to do with how your ice maker or if it’s not working properly. The clearness of your ice will vary according to the quality of water you use for your ice maker.

**Solution:** If you want clear-looking ice then you need to lower the total dissolved solids (TSD) of your water. Use filtered water, or even better use a TDS zero water filter or distilled water. If you are happy with cloudy ice, then remember to descale your machine more often to reduce mineral deposits.

Our Expertise
-------------

Your product guide, Roger Shitaki, has developed expertise in refrigeration and water related appliances such as water cooler dispensers, mini refrigerators, and refrigerator water filters. These include numerous in-depth articles, buying guides, and test-based reviews.

He actively participated in both the test design and implementation phases of this ice maker series. Each ice maker went through at least 36 hours of ice making including preliminary and actual test phases.

During this time, our team became familiar with each machine’s working pattern and encountered various troubleshooting issues along the way. We checked the working of sensors, and experimented with different grades of water and the effects of temperature.

FAQ
---

**1\. Do countertop ice makers keep ice frozen?**

Typically, more affordable portable ice makers do not have a refrigerated compartment. They can maintain ice to varying degrees of quality for up to 8 hours. Over time, ice will melt back into the water reservoir below the basket.

**2\. Can I leave my countertop ice maker on all the time?**

Yes, you can. Eventually, ice will melt and if it drops away from the ‘Ice Full’ sensor, ice production will resume. Some countertop ice makers, especially for nugget ice, have a refrigerated compartment to preserve ice quality.

**3\. What to look for when buying an ice maker?**

First, decide whether you need bullet ice, nugget ice, or ice cubes. Portable bullet and cube ice makers are the cheapest and use a built-in water reservoir. Nugget ice makers often need a water line connection, but some are portable. Ice making capacity per hour is a good quality indicator as are good lid joinings and clear visibility into the machine.

**4\. What is the best type of ice maker?**

It depends on what kind of ice you prefer, how much ice you need per hour, and your budget spend. Generally, ice makers with a refrigerated ice compartment are more convenient. Ice makers with a water line inlet like typical nugget ice makers produce more ice per hour than cheaper portable ones.

**5\. What is the difference between an ice maker and an ice machine?**

Largely it is a question of semantics. However, an ice maker usually refers to an ice making mechanism in a refrigerator. Ice machines tend to be stand alone appliances, sometimes quite large or even built into a kitchen cabinet. Small, countertop or portable machines are often referred to as ice makers.
