Two bullet ice makers getting readied for testing

Most portable bullet ice makers claim to make up to 26 lbs or 12 kg of ice in one day. We have never substantiated such claims since there are many variables that can affect the working rhythm of an ice machine and its ice quality.

Our [ice capacity test](https://healthykitchen101.com/ice-makers/tests/bullet/ice-capacity/) focuses on practical concerns that affect users.

1.  We prep machines by running them **overnight**.
2.  The tanks are refilled with **slightly chilled water**.
3.  We assess **3 consecutive rounds** of large ice bullet making.

From this, we calculate the average time it takes to fill a basket, how much ice you get per basket, the ice capacity per hour, and how much ice you can expect over 24 hours.

For our [ice quality test](https://healthykitchen101.com/ice-makers/tests/bullet/ice-quality/), we run the machines from start up, timing and separately weighing each round of ice making. All our tests use zero TDS filtered water.

We see how long it takes a machine to produce ice bullets of a consistent weight. Most machines stabilize to a net weight of 5 grams or more. A decent machine usually takes 5 to 8 rounds of ice making to stabilize and we run our test for 15 to 20 rounds.

How We Rate
-----------

Apart from the data driven tests above, we also monitor ice makers for the noise they make. As part of our overall rating system, we evaluate various key aspects of design and how this impacts **user-friendliness**.

We pay careful attention to **visibility** into machines for easy-of-use and effective troubleshooting. We rate machines for build quality, control panels for **user-centered** design, and ice baskets for **effective scooping**. We also run machines overnight to test **lid insulation**.

Reviews of the Best Portable Bullet Ice Makers in 2024
------------------------------------------------------

Here are our picks for the best countertop ice makers tested and evaluated in our lab. For more detailed information, follow the link at the end of each review.

1\. Best Overall: VIVOHOME Automatic Ice Maker

*   Large chunky ice bullets
*   Spacious control panel
*   Large ice basket
*   Reservoir capacity
*   Easy-to-clean body

*   Lid insulation
*   Bulky design

The Vivo Home VH808 won out as our best countertop ice maker due to its robust build and top-class performance. Although somewhat bulky and ergonomic in its design, its most stand-out feature is the spacious and user-friendly control panel.

In our tests, the Vivo Home consistently produced some of the largest and chunkiest ice bullets we have ever seen. The average weight of a large ice bullet was **7 grams** with some reaching up to 8.56 grams. Close rivals rarely managed more than 7 grams on occasions.\[192\] VIVOHOME Automatic Ice Maker Ice Quality Test 2

The Vivo Home was also one of the few machines we tested that consistently produced zero amounts of broken or waste ice. The average basket capacity was a whopping **561 grams**—just slightly more than our runner-up the Frigidaire EFIC189 and the time per basket clocked 10 minutes more at **113 min per load**.

The Vivo Home design is a little dated compared to more modern designs which often have larger transparent lids. Nonetheless, we particularly liked the upfront control panel on the Vivo Home lid and the wide ice basket had good scoop leverage.

If you’re looking for a no-fuss machine that consistently makes excellent quality ice, and the large chunky bullets, this Vivo Home is our top pick for a countertop ice maker.

2\. Best Runner-Up: Frigidaire EFIC189 Portable Ice Maker

*   Performance
*   Production capacity
*   Internal visibility
*   Firm ice basket
*   Good insulation
*   Easy to clean exterior

*   Ice basket fit
*   Drainage plug

The Frigidaire ice maker is an all-round excellent machine. Good design and build quality is matched to both consistent high ice quality and top production capacity.

It was one of the few machines, like the VivoHome, that averaged over 18 oz or 500 g (**555g** exact) of quality ice per basket. It produced 11.4 oz (323 g) of ice per hour and one basket took around **103 minutes**.\[52\] Frigidaire Portable Ice Maker Good Capacity 1

Not only that, the average weight per large ice bullet was a good **6.2 g**, and occasionally it managed to put out bullets of 7 grams. The amount of waste or broken ice produced was only an average of 1.8% of net basket weight, which was one of the lowest.

The Frigidaire EFIC 189 has a rounded rather than boxy design with high interior visibility. However, we found the control panel a bit cramped at the rear end of the machine, and the lid joinings were not so good. For keeping and serving ice throughout the day, the lid insulation was not the best, and very similar to the Vivo Home.

3\. Best Tech and Color Line-Up: Silonn SLIM01 Countertop Ice Maker

*   Stainless steel body
*   Large transparent lid
*   Spacious panel

*   Flimsy basket
*   Basket design

The Silonn is at best an average performing machine, but it has a couple of nice design features and is available in a variety of colors. We tested the stainless steel body model, but you can get identical plastic-bodied machines in black, teal, red, silver, and white. 

There is also a model that uses a **smart app** for an additional user interface.

The average weight per basket was an average low of only **15 oz (427 g)**, but the time per cycle was relatively good at **94 min** and the hourly capacity was somewhat better than a few other machines.\[21\] Silonn Countertop Ice Maker Ice Capacity

Overall, this machine produced good chunky ice bullets with an average weight of **5.6 g**. However, the bullers were not always smoothly shaped and sometimes came out looking like spent slugs rather than slender bullets.

Regardless, the Silonn has a refreshing and spacious design for its control panel and we also liked the large view window. The ice basket is very generic, made from a lower quality type of plastic, and identical to the AGLucky.

If you like the color choice, it’s not a bad machine. Also, not many portable ice makers have a model with [a smart app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smart.life.regineer&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1) which can be used to set a timer, select ice bullet size, run auto clean, and get status notifications.

4\. Best Compact Design: Crownful Small 22lbs Portable Ice Machine

*   Compactness
*   High visibility
*   Ice scoop
*   Ice basket

*   Control panel
*   Varying ice quality

Although all bullet ice makers we review are portable, this Crownful is the best compact ice maker we have tested. It’s significantly smaller than most other machines and is a **22 lbs ice maker** rather than a 26 lbs machine.

Apart from being small and compact, the Crownful is customized in other ways thus avoiding generic parts and designs. The small ice basket has a sloped design to maximize ice storage and a raised edge for easier ice scooping.\[221\] CROWNFUL Ice MakerIce Quality Test

It also has a neat bonnet-like transparent lid that forms part of the front body. The control panel has uniquely designed icons, although we felt them to be cramped and not so intuitive to understand.

In terms of performance and ice making, the Crownful understandably produces less ice than a full-sized machine. Overall, it took slightly longer to make ice and the bullets were **only 4 grams** on average, or one to two grams smaller than most other machines.

You can expect around **284 grams per basket** within an average time of **87 minutes**. Ice quality varied somewhat and although measured against a high benchmark, we found the performance to be good for its size.

### Other Machines We Have Tested

*   [**AGLucky HZB-12/B**](https://healthykitchen101.com/ice-makers/reviews/aglucky/aglucky-ice-maker-hzb-12b/)**:** A worthy competitor especially in terms of ice bullet size, quality, as well as overall capacity. Its performance is better than the Silonn, but the build quality is rather average and the ice basket a low quality generic design. 
*   [**EUHomy IM-01-WA**](https://healthykitchen101.com/ice-makers/reviews/euhomy/euhomy-ice-maker-im-01-wa/)**:** The EUHomy has excellent build quality and non-generic custom made parts. However, it falls short in terms of performance with time, capacity, and ice quality all much lower than competitive machines. 
*   [**Igloo (Nostalgia)**](https://healthykitchen101.com/ice-makers/reviews/igloo/igloo-portable-ice-maker-26-lb-handle/)**:** The Igloo is attractive for its retro-design and nice color range. It disappointed with performance and is not a machine we recommend.

Things That Affect Good Ice Making

Regardless of what portable ice maker you buy, there are a few things that will affect the quality of your ice and your machine’s production capacity. 

*   For clear-looking ice and to extend the lifespan of your machine, use filtered water or [zero TDS water](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-filters/reviews/zerowater/zerowater-pitcher-23-cup/).
*   Refill using chilled (filtered) water of around 10℃ (50℉) to maintain consistent ice bullet weight and production capacity.
*   Run your ice maker away from direct sunlight and with a room temperature of 10‒32 ℃ (50‒90℉).

What is a portable countertop ice maker? 
-----------------------------------------

A portable countertop ice maker has an internal water tank or holding reservoir. This means it does not need an in-line water connection. Therefore, you can place them anywhere—in your kitchen, in a pantry, or even an RV home.

Some portable ice-makers can also include the option of an in-line water connection. These ice makers tend to be for making pebble or nugget ice. They are often more expensive and may have built-in refrigerated ice storage.

What kinds of ice can a countertop ice maker produce? 
------------------------------------------------------

A portable ice maker will generally only make one type of ice. Bullet ice makers are more affordable and usually include the option of small and large bullet sizes. However, many people prefer pellet or nugget ice, and a few portable machines can make ice cubes.

**Large ice bullets:**

*   Average 5 to 7 grams.
*   Best for ice teas, smoothies, sodas, and similar beverages.

**Small ice bullets:** 

*   Average 2 to 5 grams.
*   Best of ice beds for seafood, beer, or other beverage containers.

**Nugget ice:** 

*   Easily chewable.
*   Absorbs beverage flavors.
*   Best ice for cocktails, smoothies, teas, and more.
*   Can be used for ice beds for seafood and beverage containers.

**Cube Ice:** 

*   Similar to ice made in traditional ice trays.
*   Preferred for some types of beverages.

Often, the key choice is whether to go with a countertop bullet ice maker or a nugget ice maker. This handy comparison table can help you understand the choice better:

| Bullet Ice | Nugget Ice |
| --- | --- |
| Usually only portable. | Portable and / or uses a water-line. |
| Usually no freezer compartment. | Usually has a freezer compartment. |
| More affordable. | Pricier. |
| Small and large bullets. | Small sized nuggets. |
| Good for ice teas, smoothies, sodas. | Good for most drinks, esp. cocktails. |
| More versatile than ice cubes. | Chewable and absorb beverage flavor. |
| Small bullets can be used for ice beds. | Suitable for ice beds. |

Portable ice makers, as convenient as they are, can be temperamental! Here are a few common issues we came across during testing, and tips to keep the ice flowing.

### 1\. Why are my Ice bullets so small?

If the (large) ice bullets continually come out too small (<5g average) the problem could be the machine isn’t selecting the correct ice type even though you select large. Remember, it usually takes around 8 cycles to reach 5g or more.

**Solution:** Hold down the start button to run the self-cleaning function. This will flush the system and probably clear the settings. Switch the machine off for about 3 minutes and then restart.

### 2\. Why does my ice maker say ‘ICE FULL’ when it’s not?

Sometimes the ICE FULL alert will display, but the ice basket is not full. This could be due to the fit of the ice basket or other interference with the infrared sensors. 

**Solution:** Make sure the ice basket is secure by pressing it down more firmly into place. Wipe the sensors to remove any mineral deposits and check to see if light refraction isn’t affecting the interior of the machine.

### 3\. Why does my ice maker say ‘ADD WATER’ when there is water?

A more common problem we encountered was the ADD WATER alert popping on even though the tank had enough water. There could be a number of reasons for this such as maybe an air blockage or dirt in the system.

**Solution:** Usually, if you long-press the start button to run the self-cleaning function the problem will sort itself out. An additional trick is to drain some water out the machine and the pressure could move the air block. Failing this, we fixed one ice maker by cleaning the machine with a solution of white vinegar and water. Grime under the water guard could also be an issue.

### 4\. Why does it take so long to make ice (often poor quality)?

If you’ve been running your machine for a long time, there could be an ice blockage. Alternatively, your water and room temperature may not be ideal. 

**Solution:** Switch off the machine for at least an hour to melt any ice that may be trapped and then restart using fresh water. Use water of over 15℃, check your room temperature, or place the machine in a cooler location.

### 5\. Why is my ice always so cloudy?

This has nothing to do with how your ice maker or if it’s not working properly. The clearness of your ice will vary according to the quality of water you use for your ice maker.

**Solution:** If you want clear-looking ice then you need to lower the total dissolved solids (TSD) of your water. Use filtered water, or even better use a TDS zero water filter. If you are happy with cloudy ice, then remember to descale your machine more often to reduce mineral deposits.

FAQ
---

**1\. Do countertop ice makers keep ice frozen?**

Typically, more affordable portable ice makers do not have a refrigerated compartment. They can maintain ice to varying degrees of quality for up to 8 hours. Over time, ice will melt back into the water reservoir below the basket.

**2\. Can I leave my countertop ice maker on all the time?**

Yes, you can. Eventually, ice will melt and if it drops away from the ‘Ice Full’ sensor, ice production will resume. Some countertop ice makers, especially for nugget ice, have a refrigerated compartment to preserve ice quality.

**3\. What to look for when buying an ice maker?**

First, decide whether you need bullet ice, nugget ice, or ice cubes. Portable bullet and cube ice makers are the cheapest and use a built-in water reservoir. Nugget ice makers often need a water line connection, but some are portable. Ice making capacity per hour is a good quality indicator as are good lid joinings and clear visibility into the machine.

**4\. What is the best type of ice maker?**

It depends on what kind of ice you prefer, how much ice you need per hour, and your budget spend. Generally, ice makers with a refrigerated ice compartment are more convenient. Ice makers with a water line inlet like typical nugget ice makers produce more ice per hour than cheaper portable ones.

**5\. What is the difference between an ice maker and an ice machine?**

Largely it is a question of semantics. However, an ice maker usually refers to an ice making mechanism in a refrigerator. Ice machines tend to be stand alone appliances, sometimes quite large or even built into a kitchen cabinet. Small, countertop or portable machines are often referred to as ice makers.
