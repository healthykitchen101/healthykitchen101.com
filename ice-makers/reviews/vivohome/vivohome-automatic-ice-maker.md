The Vivo Home has a somewhat bulky and dated design. At the same time, it is one of the best performing portable ice makers we have tested, especially for chunky and weighty ice bullets.

In tune with its ergonomic design, the view window is minimally sufficient, but the ice basket is comfortably wide. Although the spacious control panel stands out for its user-friendly upfront positioning, the lid insulation design is not that great.

The Vivo Home has convincingly proved itself one of the best performing portable ice makers we have tested. It topped the charts in terms of ice quality with ice bullet size and weight often while producing zero amounts of waste ice. Its overall capacity was only slightly less than two of its closest rivals. If you’re looking for really thick and chunky ice bullets, this may be the machine for you.
