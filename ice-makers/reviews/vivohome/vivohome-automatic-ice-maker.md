The Vivo Home has a somewhat bulky and dated design. At the same time, it is one of the best performing portable ice makers we have tested, especially for chunky and weighty ice bullets.

In tune with its ergonomic design, the view window is minimally sufficient, but the ice basket is comfortably wide. Although the spacious control panel stands out for its user-friendly upfront positioning, the lid insulation design is not that great.

**Things We Like**

*   Large chunky ice bullets
*   Spacious control panel
*   Large ice basket

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Lid insulation
*   Bulky design

Vivo Home is a California based company that manufactures a wide range of home, leisure, and hobby products. They have a colorful range of countertop bullet ice makers and a couple of portable nugget ice makers.

The Vivo Home has convincingly proved itself one of the best performing portable ice makers we have tested. It topped the charts in terms of ice quality with ice bullet size and weight often while producing zero amounts of waste ice. Its overall capacity was only slightly less than two of its closest rivals. If you’re looking for really thick and chunky ice bullets, this may be the machine for you.

### Ice Capacity Test: Competitively Good

Average Time Basket: 115 min

Average Weight Basket: 23 oz (561 g)

Average Waste Basket: 0.2 oz (5.7 g)

Capacity Hr: 10.5 oz (298 g)

Capacity24 Hrs: 15.9 lbs (7.2 kg)

The Vivo Home makes quite thick and chunky ice bullets. Consequently, the average ice making cycle is 11 min 30 sec which is around 2 min longer than similarly performing machines such as the [Frigidaire EFIC189](https://healthykitchen101.com/ice-makers/reviews/frigidaire/frigidaire-portable-ice-maker-efic189/) and also the [AGLucky HZB-12B](https://healthykitchen101.com/ice-makers/reviews/aglucky/aglucky-ice-maker-hzb-12b/#usability).

The average time to fill a basket takes a little longer on average, around 105 min or 1 hr 45 min. However, our tests showed that periodically the time can increase an additional 20 min or so. Capacity wise, you can expect up to 10.5 oz per hour or 7.2 kg over 24 hrs. This is slightly less than its two closest rivals.

### Ice Quality Test: Top Class

Average Weight Bullet: 0.25 oz (7 g)

Like most other machines, the Vivo Home takes around 5 rounds or waves of ice making before it stabilizes into a typical working pattern of 5 grams or more per bullet.

However, we were surprised at how quickly the Vivo Home produced rounds of ice weighing 6 grams or more per bullet. In fact, it regularly produced ice bullets of over 7 grams and even some weighing as much as 8.7 grams.

Put into perspective, its close rival the Frigidaire EFIC189 rarely reached 7g, and the AGLucky HZB-12/B only reached 7.7 grams on occasions. Furthermore, there were regular rounds where zero amounts of waste ice were produced. A rare feat for other machines.

The immediate impression of the Vivo Home is that of an older, more bulky kind of design. What stands out, though, is the spacious control panel on the upper part of the lid. It also has a comfortably sized basket. Despite the solid build quality, the lid showed comparatively poor insulation design.

### In The Box

*   One ice maker
*   User manual
*   Detachable ice basket
*   Ice scoop

The Vivo Home countertop ice maker arrived securely boxed between two styrofoam pads. The ice basket and scoop were securely taped down—as was the ice scooping mechanism of the machine which you shouldn’t forget to remove.

### Dimensions

Width: 13.1" (33.3 cm)

Depth: 9.5" (24.1 cm)

Height: 13.0" (33.0 cm)

Weight: 15.4 lbs (7.0 kg)

### 8.0 - Build Quality: A Match to Performance

We liked the hard front body of the Vivo Home and the fact it was easy to keep clean. The sides, by comparison, are made of a more bendable plastic. We found no flaws on the body, although one quality issue or perhaps design flaw, were the lid joinings with their noticeable gaps.
