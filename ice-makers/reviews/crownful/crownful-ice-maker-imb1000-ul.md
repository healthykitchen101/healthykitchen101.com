Crownful is noticeably smaller than other machines we have tested and is essentially a compact portable ice maker. The modern lid design and boxy shape is very appealing, but we found the control panel icons confusing at first. 

Understandably, the average time to fill a basket and the basket capacity is less by comparison. Also, the average size and weight of ice bullets never exceeds 4 g per bullet. This should not be an issue if you prefer smaller ice bullets. However, the quality and size of the ice bullets tends to vary and it takes a few baskets to really get going.

The performance is nonetheless overall quite acceptable and this machine is our [best ice maker](https://healthykitchen101.com/ice-makers/reviews/best/) for a compact design.

**Things We Like**

*   Compactness
*   High visibility
*   Ice scoop
*   Ice basket

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Control panel
*   Varying ice quality

Crownful is a kitchenware brand that makes nifty looking appliances. Apart from this compact 22 lbs portable ice maker, they have a larger 33 lbs bullet ice maker and a commercial ice making machine.

For a compact portable ice maker, we found the performance of the Crownful to be quite acceptable. If you have limited space and don’t need a lot of ice, the Crownful is not a bad choice. You wait a little longer for smaller ice bullets and the overall capacity is less, but the machine is very quiet and the design more customized than most.

### Ice Capacity Test: Reasonable

Average Time Basket: 87 min

Average Weight Basket: 10 oz (284 g)

Average Waste Basket: 0.5 oz (14 g)

Capacity Hr: 6.9 oz (196 g)

Capacity24 Hrs: 10.4 lbs (4.7 kg)

With its more compact design and smaller basket, the Crownful generally only takes about 87 min, or an hour and a half, to fill a basket. The weight per basket is around 10 oz (284g) which is almost half that of a full-sized machine like the [Vivo Home](https://healthykitchen101.com/ice-makers/reviews/vivohome/vivohome-automatic-ice-maker/). By comparison, the Crownful takes longer to make ice while the bullets are smaller by size and by weight. In our tests, it took about two good basket loads before the machine really started to make consistently good ice.

### Ice Quality Test: Inconsistent

Average Weight Bullet: 1.14 oz (4.01 g)

The Crownful was the first machine we tested that stabilized to a performance standard of 4 g per large bullet and not 5 g. Its performance, however, topped the Igloo ice maker which is a slightly larger machine sporting a retro design. Even still, the ice quality was not so consistent. This machine averages 4.9% waste ice whereas top-performing machines like the [Frigidiare](https://healthykitchen101.com/ice-makers/reviews/frigidaire/frigidaire-portable-ice-maker-efic189/) or Vivo Home average less than 2% of waste ice.

The Crownful is well-built with a compact and modern design. Whereas many other machines simply go the course of generic parts and copycat design, the Crownful stands its ground. It’s a uniquely designed machine with a number of user-friendly features.

### 7.6 - Panel Design: Nice Try

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/crownful-ice-maker-panel-design-cls8lkf4w00040q882pfr4r8v.jpg" alt="A close up view of a control panel on a portable ice maker." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/crownful-ice-maker-panel-design-1-cls8lkgci000q0q885gvg76gt.jpg" alt="A top view of a portable ice maker with the scoop seen inside a basket filled with ice." width="300px" height="200px">

Buttons: 2 - On/Off Select

Power Indicator: Yes

Ice Full Indicator: Yes

Add Water Indicator: Yes

IceS Indicator: Yes

IceL Indicator: Yes

The nice thing about the panel design is that it attempts to do more than just the usual generic design. The Crownful uses icons on the control panel—something not many ice makers attempt to do.

The icons, however, are a bit small and not so intuitively understood, so you will probably need to consult the manual to understand them. We also noticed a small dent in the printed plastic control panel surface, but the controls worked flawlessly during our testing.

### 7.3 - Lid: Lacks Good Insulation

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/crownful-ice-maker-lid-design-cls8lkgce000o0q88bn3zhptj.jpg" alt="Close up view of a portable ice maker with its lid closed." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/crownful-ice-maker-lid-design-1-cls8lkfbz00060q88f3ba87pt.jpg" alt="A basket full of ice being held in front of a bullet ice making machine." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Transparent plastic

The lid on the Crownful complements its boxy design while increasing visibility. The plastic cleans well and does not scratch or stain easily. However, the fit of the lid is a little loose and the joinings are not so well-designed for insulation. Our overnight test revealed that ice preservation to be less than ideal.

### 8.1 - Ice Basket: Thoughtful Design

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/crownful-ice-maker-ice-basket-cls8lkfv0000e0q881l5v839l.jpg" alt="An empty ice basket partially visible being held in front of an ice making machine. Caption = Raised edge and extended rear creating a slope." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/crownful-ice-maker-ice-basket-1-cls8lkg3h000l0q88gf8a7vka.jpg" alt="A countertop ice maker with a scoop filled with ice in front and an empty ice basket to the right side." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 7.7" (19.6 cm)

Height: 3.5" (8.9 cm)

Depth: 4.2" (10.7 cm)

Material: Hard Plastic

The Crownful has a raised edge on the left hand of its basket plus the scoop has a shorter handle and more elongated design to accommodate easier scooping. We noticed the basket sits a little close to the sensors, but this proved not to be an issue during testing. It also has an extended rear to maximize the small basket’s capacity.

### Water Reservoir: Matched to Performance

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/crownful-ice-maker-water-reservoir-cls8lkf0b00030q88e395105u.jpg" alt="The inside of a portable countertop ice maker reservoir." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/crownful-ice-maker-water-reservoir-1-cls8lkfu0000a0q883lry1qgq.jpg" alt="Water being poured in a portable countertop ice maker." width="300px" height="200px">

Capacity: 1.3 qt (1.2 L)

Although similar in overall size to the Igloo, the reservoir of the Crownful is only 1.3 qt compared to 1.6 qt. Standard-sized machines such as the Frigidaire can hold as much as 2.2 qt (2.2 L). With a smaller capacity and longer ice making times, the smaller reservoir is not a major drawback.

### Drainage Plug: A Tough Pull

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/crownful-ice-maker-drainage-plug-cls8lkg12000i0q886ei73vtp.jpg" alt="A hand holding the plug to a water reservoir on a countertop bullet ice maker." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Silicone and plastic

The drainage port on the Crownful in on the right hand side of the machine. The silicone plug is a little cumbersome to get out, so you may need to look for the end that sticks up from inside the tank and push it down. Other than that, its tether is long enough to hook around the edge of the machine.

### Ice Scoop

### Cord and Plug

Length: 5.9 ft. (1.8 m)

Plug Type: 3-pronged earthed

The black cord of the Crownful is a standard or 71 inches long. It is a 3-pronged earthed plug which is the safest standard for an appliance that remains on for an extended period of time.66

The Crownful is a nicely designed machine with a number of thoughtful features, such as the basket and ice scoop, which complement its compactness. Although the modern lid design enhances overall visibility, the control panel icons are not so useful. It is easy enough to keep clean and also one of the quietest machines we have tested.

### 7.8 - Ease of Use: Thoughtful Design

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/crownful-ice-maker-ease-use-cls8lkfuu000c0q888iyqeyvx.jpg" alt="A man is carrying a portable ice maker to place on a table top." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/crownful-ice-maker-ease-use-1-cls8lkgcn000u0q884bvk1dp1.jpg" alt="Ice being scooped out of an ice basket inside a portable ice maker." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/crownful-ice-maker-ease-use-2-cls8lkfpu00080q884fm15uo0.jpg" alt="A full basket of ice being removed from a countertop portable ice maker." width="300px" height="200px">

The lid, which integrates with the body, gives a welcomed high visibility into an otherwise compact machine. We likewise appreciated the control panel for its more original design, but the icons were cramped and not so intuitive to understand.

For a small machine, the Crownful doesn’t cut corners but makes an effort to enhance user-friendliness. The ice basket has a raised edge for easier scooping while the ice scoop has a shorter handle and more elongated design.

### 8.7 - Noise: Small and Very Quiet

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/crownful-ice-maker-noise-cls8lkfc000070q880rla2qie.jpg" alt="A sound measuring meter standing next to the fan vent of a portable ice maker and measuring 65.5 dB as a reading." width="300px" height="200px">

Decibels: 65.5 dB

The Crownful measured a comparatively low 65.5 dB which was a good match to its smaller, more compact size. If you are looking for a small and quiet machine, this might be the one for you.

### 8.4 - Cleaning: A Couple of Drawbacks

Self Cleaning: Yes

The shiny black exterior of the Crownful is basically fingerprint-resistant and easy to keep clean. Although the drainage plug hooks neatly over the edge of the machine, we did find it a little challenging to remove. Also, the waterguard inside the reservoir comes off really easily so you need to check carefully that it is secured into place.
