Crownful is noticeably smaller than other machines we have tested and is essentially a compact portable ice maker. The modern lid design and boxy shape is very appealing, but we found the control panel icons confusing at first. 

Understandably, the average time to fill a basket and the basket capacity is less by comparison. Also, the average size and weight of ice bullets never exceeds 4 g per bullet. This should not be an issue if you prefer smaller ice bullets. However, the quality and size of the ice bullets tends to vary and it takes a few baskets to really get going. 

The performance is nonetheless overall quite acceptable and this machine is our [best ice maker](https://healthykitchen101.com/ice-makers/reviews/best/) for a compact design.

**Things We Like**

*   Compactness
*   High visibility
*   Ice scoop
*   Ice basket

**Things We Don’t Like**

For a compact portable ice maker, we found the performance of the Crownful to be quite acceptable. If you have limited space and don’t need a lot of ice, the Crownful is not a bad choice. You wait a little longer for smaller ice bullets and the overall capacity is less, but the machine is very quiet and the design more customized than most.

### Ice Capacity Test: Reasonable

Average Time Basket: 87 min

Average Weight Basket: 10 oz (284 g)

Average Waste Basket: 0.5 oz (14 g)

Capacity Hr: 6.9 oz (196 g)

Capacity24 Hrs: 10.4 lbs (4.7 kg)

With its more compact design and smaller basket, the Crownful generally only takes about 87 min, or an hour and a half, to fill a basket. The weight per basket is around 10 oz (284g) which is almost half that of a full-sized machine like the [Vivo Home](https://healthykitchen101.com/ice-makers/reviews/vivohome/vivohome-automatic-ice-maker/). By comparison, the Crownful takes longer to make ice while the bullets are smaller by size and by weight. In our tests, it took about two good basket loads before the machine really started to make consistently good ice.

### Ice Quality Test: Inconsistent

Average Weight Bullet: 1.14 oz (4.01 g)

The Crownful was the first machine we tested that stabilized to a performance standard of 4 g per large bullet and not 5 g. Its performance, however, topped the Igloo ice maker which is a slightly larger machine sporting a retro design. Even still, the ice quality was not so consistent. This machine averages 4.9% waste ice whereas top-performing machines like the Frigidiare or Vivo Home average less than 2% of waste ice.

The Crownful is well-built with a compact and modern design. Whereas many other machines simply go the course of generic parts and copycat design, the Crownful stands its ground. It’s a uniquely designed machine with a number of user-friendly features.

### Dimensions

Width: 11.2" (28.4 cm)

Depth: 9.0" (22.9 cm)

Height: 11.0" (27.9 cm)

Weight: 13.0 lbs (5.9 kg)

### 8.0 - Build Quality: Good Overall

### 7.6 - Panel Design: Nice Try

Buttons: 2 - On/Off Select

Power Indicator: Yes

Ice Full Indicator: Yes

Add Water Indicator: Yes

IceS Indicator: Yes

IceL Indicator: Yes

The nice thing about the panel design is that it attempts to do more than just the usual generic design. The Crownful uses icons on the control panel—something not many ice makers attempt to do.

The icons, however, are a bit small and not so intuitively understood, so you will probably need to consult the manual to understand them. We also noticed a small dent in the printed plastic control panel surface, but the controls worked flawlessly during our testing.

### 7.3 - Lid: Lacks Good Insulation

Material: Transparent plastic

The lid on the Crownful complements its boxy design while increasing visibility. The plastic cleans well and does not scratch or stain easily. However, the fit of the lid is a little loose and the joinings are not so well-designed for insulation. Our overnight test revealed that ice preservation to be less than ideal.

### 8.1 - Ice Basket: Thoughtful Design

Length: 7.7" (19.6 cm)

Height: 3.5" (8.9 cm)

Depth: 4.2" (10.7 cm)

Material: Hard Plastic

The Crownful has a raised edge on the left hand of its basket plus the scoop has a shorter handle and more elongated design to accommodate easier scooping. We noticed the basket sits a little close to the sensors, but this proved not to be an issue during testing. It also has an extended rear to maximize the small basket’s capacity.

### Water Reservoir: Matched to Performance

Capacity: 1.3 qt (1.2 L)

Although similar in overall size to the Igloo, the reservoir of the Crownful is only 1.3 qt compared to 1.6 qt. Standard-sized machines such as the Frigidaire can hold as much as 2.2 qt (2.2 L). With a smaller capacity and longer ice making times, the smaller reservoir is not a major drawback.

### Drainage Plug: A Tough Pull

Material: Silicone and plastic

The drainage port on the Crownful in on the right hand side of the machine. The silicone plug is a little cumbersome to get out, so you may need to look for the end that sticks up from inside the tank and push it down. Other than that, its tether is long enough to hook around the edge of the machine.

### Ice Scoop

Material: Hard white plastic

### Cord and Plug

Length: 5.9 ft. (1.8 m)

Plug Type: 3-pronged earthed

The black cord of the Crownful is a standard or 71 inches long. It is a 3-pronged earthed plug which is the safest standard for an appliance that remains on for an extended period of time.66

The Crownful is a nicely designed machine with a number of thoughtful features, such as the basket and ice scoop, which complement its compactness. Although the modern lid design enhances overall visibility, the control panel icons are not so useful. It is easy enough to keep clean and also one of the quietest machines we have tested.

### 7.8 - Ease of Use: Thoughtful Design

The lid, which integrates with the body, gives a welcomed high visibility into an otherwise compact machine. We likewise appreciated the control panel for its more original design, but the icons were cramped and not so intuitive to understand.

For a small machine, the Crownful doesn’t cut corners but makes an effort to enhance user-friendliness. The ice basket has a raised edge for easier scooping while the ice scoop has a shorter handle and more elongated design.

### 8.7 - Noise: Small and Very Quiet

Decibels: 65.5 dB

The Crownful measured a comparatively low 65.5 dB which was a good match to its smaller, more compact size. If you are looking for a small and quiet machine, this might be the one for you.

### 8.4 - Cleaning: A Couple of Drawbacks

Self Cleaning: Yes

The shiny black exterior of the Crownful is basically fingerprint-resistant and easy to keep clean. Although the drainage plug hooks neatly over the edge of the machine, we did find it a little challenging to remove. Also, the waterguard inside the reservoir comes off really easily so you need to check carefully that it is secured into place.
