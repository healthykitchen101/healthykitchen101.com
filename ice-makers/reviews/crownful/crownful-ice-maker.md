Crownful is noticeably smaller than other machines we have tested and is essentially a compact portable ice maker. The modern lid design and boxy shape is very appealing, but we found the control panel icons confusing at first. 

Understandably, the average time to fill a basket and the basket capacity is less by comparison. Also, the average size and weight of ice bullets never exceeds 4 g per bullet. This should not be an issue if you prefer smaller ice bullets. However, the quality and size of the ice bullets tends to vary and it takes a few baskets to really get going. 

The performance is nonetheless overall quite acceptable and this machine is our [best ice maker](https://healthykitchen101.com/ice-makers/reviews/best/) for a compact design.

**Things We Like**

*   Compactness
*   High visibility
*   Ice scoop
*   Ice basket

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Control panel
*   Varying ice quality

Crownful is a kitchenware brand that makes nifty looking appliances. Apart from this compact 22 lbs portable ice maker, they have a larger 33 lbs bullet ice maker and a commercial ice making machine.

For a compact portable ice maker, we found the performance of the Crownful to be quite acceptable. If you have limited space and don’t need a lot of ice, the Crownful is not a bad choice. You wait a little longer for smaller ice bullets and the overall capacity is less, but the machine is very quiet and the design more customized than most.
