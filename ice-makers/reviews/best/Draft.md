How We Select Products to Test
------------------------------

While testing popular machines is always important, we also select machines based on unique features, and try to test a range of machines suited to different needs or circumstances. In this way, you will know if the most popular countertop ice makers are really worth it, and what the other good picks are.

### Comparison of Our Best 3 Countertop Bullet Ice Makers

Here is a comparison table to visualize more clearly the key performance differences between our top three picks for the best countertop ice maker:

|  | 1. Frigidaire | 2. AGLucky | 3. Silonn |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Time per basket | 103 min | 90 min | 94 min |
| Average weight | 555 g | 456 g | 427 g |
| Net bullet weight | 6.2 g | 6.3 g | 5.6 g |
| Waste ice | 1.8% | 2% | 4% |
| Capacity per hr | 323 g | 304 g | 273 g |
| Capacity per 24 hr | 7.8 kg | 7.3 kg | 6.5 kg |

From a design viewpoint, the Frigidaire is the most modern-looking with good internal visibility. The AGLucky has the smallest view window but a nicely raised control panel, while the Silonn has the most user-friendly interface. Of the three machines, the Silonn showed the best insulation while the Frigidaire fared the worst.

Although there is not a big performance difference between the Frigidaire and the AGLucky, the Frigidaire is better for ice capacity. The design differences are between a modern look versus a better control panel. The Silonn, despite its average performance, has slightly more choice in colors compared to the AGLucky and a smart app model.
