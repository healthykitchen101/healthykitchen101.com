Overall Score: **7.3**

*   Performance (60%) - **6.7**/10
    
*   Design (15%) - **8.4**/10
    
*   Usability (25%) - **8.0**/10
    

There is a lot about the EUhomy to like. Its exterior build quality is excellent, the front control panel indicators easy to see from afar, and the ice basket well-designed. Some people may even prefer the darker colored lid instead of the usual transparent design.

However, when put to the test, the EUhomy bullet ice maker simply failed to perform as well as we had hoped. It took as long as other ice makers to start producing large ice bullets, but the weight and quality was never more than a low average.

The time taken to fill a basket of ice was lengthy by comparison, and the hourly and 24-hour capacity below standard. Even considering the more original design, there are better ice makers to choose from.

**Things We Like**

*   Solid external build
*   Front control panel
*   Ice basket design

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Performance
*   Visibility

EUhomy is a company dedicated to small refrigeration appliances. They also manufacture nugget countertop ice makers and cube ice makers. We bought this ice maker to test because of its standout design with controls on the front of the machine.

Performance
-----------

performance Scores: **6.7**

*   Ice Capacity (60%) - **6.1**/10
    
*   Ice Quality (40%) - **7.6**/10
    

Out of the two performance tests we do, EUhomy did much better on the ice quality test. Even still, it only occasionally managed to make large bullets of over 6 grams. The time to fill a basket of ice was also somewhat lengthy compared to the capacity it could produce. Generally, performance was below average which contrasted to its good external build quality and slightly original design.

### Ice Capacity: A Low Average

Average Time Basket: 112 min

Average Weight Basket: 15.6 oz (441 g)

Average Waste Basket: 1.13 oz (32g)

Capacity Hr: 8.3 oz (236 g)

Capacity24 Hrs: 14.8 lbs (6.7 kg)

For our ice capacity test, we prep the machines by running them overnight. Then, after refilling the tank, we monitor how the machine produces three consecutive full baskets of ice.

For these tests, the EUhomy only produces an average basket weight of 15.6 oz (441 g), which is around 100 grams less than top performing machines. Basket sizes and scoop mechanics aside, the average hourly capacity was only 8.3 oz (236 g) since the machine took a full 112 minutes to fill a basket.

More revealing, however, was the amount of waste or broken ice that was produced. It topped 32 g (1.13 oz) on average which is by far the largest we have recorded.

### Ice Quality: Acceptable

Average Weight Bullet: 5.6 g (0.2 oz)

For the most part, the EUhomy produces nice looking ice bullets. The drawback, as mentioned in the capacity test, were the high incidences of broken or malformed ice.

Each cycle of ice making took around eight and a half minutes and the average weight of a large ice bullet was 5.6 g (0.2 oz). By comparison, most other machines tended to regularly make ice bullets of over 6 grams and sometimes reaching up to 7 grams.

In short, the EUhomy took a lot longer to produce less ice which sometimes wasn’t always of a consistently good quality.

Design

The EUhomy stands out for its material quality and different design aesthetic. It doesn't have a modern sleek edge to it, but there are useful and user-friendly features. Unfortunately, with the EUhomy, internal mechanics and performance don’t match up to the external build quality. In our grading system, we subtract 1 point from the design score for every one point discrepancy to performance.

The EUhomy has excellent external build quality. The brushed stainless steel is easy to keep clean, fingerprints are minimal, and the raised buttons are nice quality. Plastic parts are minimal, the ice basket thoughtfully designed, and the drainage plug was better than the usual generic type.

Unfortunately, there was a full 1.7 score discrepancy between external build quality and performance so we subtracted one point from the final design score. We have noted such discrepancies with other EUhomy products while testing their [water cooler dispenser](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-cooler-dispensers/reviews/e-euhomy/euhomy-bottom-loading-wc-c/) (now discontinued).

### 7.7 - Lid Design: Well Insulated

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/euhomy-ice-maker-lid-clop6cjs80027vi881q54gdu6.jpg" alt="A top down view of the plastic translucent gray colored lid of the EUhomy countertop ice maker." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/euhomy-ice-maker-lid-1-clop6gg26002avi885e5me3bn.jpg" alt="Bullet-shaped ice being scooped out of the basket of a countertop ice maker." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/euhomy-ice-maker-lid-2-clop6hju0002bvi88736p0oud.jpg" alt="Bullet ice displayed in a black enamel baking tray showing partly melted ice after the machine was left to run for 8 hours." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/euhomy-ice-maker-lid-3-clop6i4bd002cvi8804zchy12.jpg" alt="A hand with a black latex glove holding up partly melted ice from a portable bullet ice making machine." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Black non-transparent plastic

In our scoring system, we prefer a transparent lid for better ease of use. However, the lid of the EUhomy is well-constructed and proved quite effective in our overnight insulation test.

We leave machines running for eight hours and check the basket the following morning to gauge ice degradation. While there was notable ice loss, the EUhomy fared better than a lot of other machines and did a good job with preserving ice.

### 8.5 - Panel Design: Original

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/euhomy-ice-maker-panel-design-clop6j9rw002dvi8833vf92eg.jpg" alt="Close up view of the control panel on the front of the EUhomy portable ice making machine." width="300px" height="200px">

Buttons: On/Off, Select

Power Indicator: Yes

Ice Full Indicator: Yes

Add Water Indicator: Yes

IceS Indicator: Yes

IceL Indicator: Yes

Unlike almost all other ice makers, the EUhomy doesn’t have the control panel in the roof or lid, but on the front of the machine. If you have your ice maker on a high countertop, then this is quite useful. It’s a refreshing design nonetheless.

### 9.0 - Ice Basket: Better Than Most

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/euhomy-ice-maker-ice-basket-clop6knca002evi88dxo8f1t3.jpg" alt="A close up of an ice basket from a countertop ice making machine against a gray marble-like background." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 7.5" (19.1 cm)

Height: 4.4" (11.2 cm)

Depth: 4.5" (11.3 cm)

Material: Hard plastic

The EUhomy gets more than a few things right with its ice basket. It’s made of a hard plastic so doesn’t move around when you scoop and it has a raised edge on the left side. It’s also slightly larger than typical generic type designs.

### Water Reservoir: Average Volume

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/euhomy-ice-maker-water-reservoir-clop6npdt002fvi8866250xpt.jpg" alt="The top down view of the water reservoir of a countertop ice maker with no water inside." width="300px" height="200px">

Capacity: 1.7 qt (1.6 L)

The water reservoir on the EUhomy ice maker is only 1.6 L or 1.7 quarts. This is a little less than the standard average of 1.8 L or some other machines like the Frigidaire that take up to 2.1 L. Filling the reservoir is fast and simple and you can easily top it up when you take out a full basket of ice. Make sure to use chilled water (10℃‒50℉) in order not to affect the quality of the ice or slow down production.

### Drainage Plug

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/euhomy-ice-maker-drainage-plug-clop6opfp002gvi882d3a57ks.jpg" alt="A close up of the drainage plug on the bottom of a countertop portable ice maker." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Silicone

The drainage plug is on the left and not the right hand side. It is also a little stubbier than the typical generic type and it is made completely of silicone so it’s nice and soft to touch. Even with simple parts, the EUhomy avoids generic designs.

### Ice Scoop

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/euhomy-ice-maker-ice-scoop-clop6pizf002hvi888gzp8ug7.jpg" alt="A close up of a white plastic ice scoop against a gray marble-like background." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Hard white plastic

### Cord and Plug

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/euhomy-ice-maker-cord-plug-clop6r5vr002ivi88fpwth5ww.jpg" alt="A three-pronged plug at the end of a black cord pictured against the body of a portable ice making machine." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 6.1 ft (1.9 m)

Plug Type: 3-pronged

The EUhomy has a black cord which measured a full 73 inches (185 cm), or a full 2 inches longer than the typical 71 inches. This means you get a little thoughtful extra and the plug is three-pronged with an earth.

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **8.0**

*   Ease of Use (60%) - **7.8**/10
    
*   Noise (25%) - **8.2**/10
    
*   Cleaning (15%) - **8.5**/10
    

The EUhomy is an easy-to-use machine because of its larger sized ice basket and control panel on the front of the machine. Some people may not like the darker colored lid which is not easy to see through, and removing the water guard for cleaning is not so easy. However, the body of the machine is not prone to fingerprints and it has a classic looking aesthetic.

### 7.8 - Ease of Use: Thoughtfully Designed

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/euhomy-ice-maker-ease-use-clop9bjl2002jvi889wmid268.jpg" alt="A hand pressing the select button on the EUhomy countertop ice maker with the power indicator lit up green." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/euhomy-ice-maker-ease-use-1-clop9cgj9002kvi884n5gbx1n.jpg" alt="A hand scooping ice out of the ice basket of a countertop bullet ice maker." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/euhomy-ice-maker-ease-use-2-clop9d6gf002lvi88gww33x8i.jpg" alt="Top down view of the EUhomy countertop ice maker showing condensation on the lid." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/euhomy-ice-maker-ease-use-3-clop9fzl4002mvi8836ny328w.jpg" alt="A view of metal ice making rods on a portable ice maker." width="300px" height="200px">

The EUhomy has a dark-shaded translucent lid and not the usual transparent lid. You have to lift it up to see how much ice is inside—if you like the aesthetic this might work for you.

Other than that, it has some nice design features. The ice basket is a firm solid plastic with a raised edge on the left which helps with scoping out the last of the ice. The scoop leverage is also better than average since the basket is a little wider. 

What makes the EUhomy stand out, however, is its control panel on the front of the machine and not the top. The buttons were also raised and good quality. Some people may like this design and we found that it had no real disadvantage.

### 8.2 - Noise: A Comfortable Average

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/euhomy-ice-maker-noise-clop9jxhj002nvi88g8va66mu.jpg" alt="The Euhomy portable ice maker operating on a countertop with a sound meter showing 67.5 decibels." width="300px" height="200px">

Decibels: 67.5 dB

When making large ice bullets, the EUhomy registered 67.5 dB on our sound meter. You hardly notice the machine while it is running, but things get a little louder when the ice pops out. There are quieter machines, but the EUhomy was by no means the noisiest.

### 8.5 - Cleaning: One Minor Hinderance

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/euhomy-ice-maker-cleaning-clop9l0k5002ovi88fv8p3k5x.jpg" alt="The water guard in the right hand corner of the water reservoir of a portable ice maker." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/euhomy-ice-maker-cleaning-1-clop9lpjz002pvi88h0ly6jtq.jpg" alt="A close up of the drainage plug on the bottom of a countertop portable ice maker." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/ice-makers/euhomy-ice-maker-cleaning-2-clop9mail002qvi888m4i0mgu.jpg" alt="A side view of the stainless steel body of the EUhomy countertop ice maker." width="300px" height="200px">

Self Cleaning: Yes

On any ice maker, the self-cleaning mechanism will only flush water through the ice making apparatus. You still occasionally wipe the reservoir clean. To do this, you first pull the drainage plug. The EUhomy has a soft silicone plug on the left and not the right hand side.

The water guard is a bit difficult to remove though, but if you cannot get it out, you can remove grime by running a white vinegar solution through the tank using the self-cleaning mechanism. It’s good to ‘descale’ every 6 months.

The body of the EUhomy is made of a high grade stainless steel so it cleans easily and is not so prone to gathering fingerprints.
