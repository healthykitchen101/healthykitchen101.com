A superior immersion blender must do more than just puree or mix; it should excel in advanced culinary skills, especially in emulsification. This principle guided our choice of mayonnaise as the focal point of our performance testing. We meticulously analyzed how each blender managed the delicate task of emulsifying oil and egg yolks into a uniform, smooth mayonnaise. This test was designed to assess not only the blending power but also the precision and control each blender offers — key attributes for sophisticated cooking techniques.

Mayonnaise is not only a staple in many kitchens but also a perfect benchmark for testing immersion blenders. This creamy sauce demands a precise balance of power and delicacy from the blender. Too much force, and the ingredients won't emulsify properly; too little, and you're left with a runny, unappetizing mess. In our testing, we scrutinized how each blender handled the intricate process of turning simple ingredients like oil and egg yolks into a smooth, cohesive mayonnaise.

This test goes beyond simple functionality. It examines how well each blender can maintain a steady speed and whether it can provide the gentle finesse needed for perfect emulsification. We also considered the design of the blender — does it allow for an easy and comfortable grip while maneuvering through such a delicate task? Are the speed settings intuitive and adaptable for such precise operations?

By using mayonnaise as a test medium, we aim to provide a clear picture of each blender's capabilities, revealing not just their ability to blend, but to do so with the control and finesse that gourmet cooking demands. The results of this test will offer invaluable insights for anyone looking to purchase an immersion blender that's as effective at making emulsified sauces as it is at handling everyday blending tasks.

By using mayonnaise, a sauce that can easily separate if not emulsified correctly, we aim to uncover the blenders that can deliver not just on power, but on the subtle art of creating a perfectly emulsified, smooth, and creamy sauce. This benchmark is intended to guide culinary enthusiasts in choosing a hand-held blender that excels in both everyday tasks and sophisticated sauce preparation.

The real test of a good immersion blender isn’t just in basic tasks like mixing or pureeing, but in its ability to handle more complex jobs, like making emulsified sauces. This is why we chose mayonnaise as our focus for this performance test.

Mayonnaise is a great test case because it requires carefully blending oil and egg yolks into a smooth sauce without separating. Our aim with this test is to find out which blenders are not just powerful, but also precise enough to make a perfect, smooth mayonnaise. This information is particularly useful for those who love cooking and want a blender that is versatile enough for simple tasks and for making more delicate sauces.

Why the Test Matters
--------------------

There are several [hand-held blenders](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/immersion-blenders/) that do not come with a whisk attachment — a specialized tool for preparing emulsified sauces. Can such blenders really excel at making salad dressings as advertised? This test showed us the truth. 

For those with the whisk attachment, the process of making mayonnaise helped us better understand their accessories in terms of efficiency and reliability.

You might wonder why we choose mayonnaise for this emulsifying test. It’s because mayonnaise is the easiest sauce to emulsify. If the blender doesn't create a uniform suspension of oil and egg yolks, it’ll probably have even more trouble with other sauces.

Testing Recipe: 8 Servings (240 ml)
-----------------------------------

*   3 egg yolks
*   240ml canola oil

Testing Procedure
-----------------

For the mayo whisking test, we initially whisked together two egg yolks and 150ml oil in a 24-oz vessel using either the blending shaft or a whisk attachment, depending on the blender’s accessory set. 

Only units with whisk attachments passed that initial test. The remaining blenders barely reached the egg yolks and left us with a jumbled mixture. The blending wands simply aren’t made for such small volumes of ingredients. We do suspect, though, that the results might have been better if we used a narrower blending container. 

At that point we decided to modify the recipe to include three egg yolks and 240ml oil. Thankfully, this amount alleviated the problem.

Unlike the soup and smoothie tests, we didn’t add all the ingredients into the beaker at the same time. Instead, we whisked the yolks at the slowest setting first and then slowly poured in the oil. 

To avoid broken mayonnaise, we didn’t increase the speed to the highest setting until the oil started emulsifying. In this case we also didn’t stop the blender periodically even when it reached the maximum run time. 

During the procedure, we also slowly raised the blending shaft or the whisk attachment to the top of the mixture and back down to incorporate all the ingredients.

Scoring Scale
-------------

The overall rating of each blender was the average of two equally-weighted section scores awarded on a scale out of 10. The section scores included: blending time and blended result. 

### Blending Time Score 

The blending time score was allocated based on how long each blender took to yield a batch of mayonnaise. Here's our breakdown of how this score was determined:

#### Score Breakdown

**≤ 1 min 30 secs**: A good immersion blender shouldn’t take long to yield a batch of mayonnaise. The reasonable amount of blending time should be around one minute and a half. That’s why we would award 10 points for any item that passed its test within that duration**.**

### Blended Result Score 

We awarded the blended result score of each blender out of 10 points based only on its texture which is always fell into one of three variants: 

*   **Velvety:** We gave 9.5-10 points for mayonnaise that were silky, creamy, and spreadable.
*   **Smooth:** This mayonnaise is emulsified harmoniously but doesn’t look as creamy as the velvety one. We awarded them **7.5 - 8.5 points**.
*   **Thick or Thin:** If the mayonnaisehad a curdled-looking or slightly streaky with visible ribbons of oil, we allocated **7 points or less** to it
*   **Broken/Separated/Runny:** We awarded no points for immersion blenders that failed to bond and emulsion the yolk and oil.
*   **1 min 31 secs ≤ 1 min 40 secs**:  9 points
*   **1 min 41 secs ≤ 1 min 50 secs**: 8 points
*   **1 min 51 secs ≤ 2 mins**: 7 points
*   **2 mins 1 sec ≤  2 mins 10 secs**: 6 points
*   **2 mins 11 secs ≤ 2 mins 20 secs**: 5 points
*   **2 mins 21 secs ≤ 2 mins 30 secs**: 4 points
*   **2 mins 31 secs ≤ 2 mins 40 secs**: 3 points 
*   **2 mins 41 secs ≤ 2 mins 50 secs**: 2 points 
*   **2 mins 51 secs ≤ 3 mins**: 1 point
*   **\>3 mins**: 0 point 

### Blended Result Score 

We awarded the blended result score of each blender out of 10 points based only on its texture which is always fell into one of three variants: 

*   Velvety: We gave 9.5-10 points for mayonnaise that were silky, creamy, and spreadable.
*   Smooth: This mayonnaise is emulsified harmoniously but doesn’t look as creamy as the velvety one. We awarded them **7.5 - 9.0 points**. 
*   Thick or Thin: If the mayonnaise had a curdled-looking or slightly streaky with visible ribbons of oil, we allocated **7 points or less** to it. 
*   Broken/Separated/Runny: We awarded no points for immersion blenders that failed to bond and emulsion the yolk and oil.
