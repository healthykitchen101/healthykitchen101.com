The Betty Crocker is not a wonder device that will please you in any major way. Itâ€™s acceptably average all round, but a dismal failure at frozen fruit smoothies. Both these blenders, however, are an equal match for the standard tasks of making hot soup purees, and both come out a little rough and sometimes lumpy. Neither of them comes with a whisk, but the Cuisinart Smart Stick is pretty good at making mayonnaise nonetheless, and especially almond milk.

The Cuisinart wins hands down with its expected high quality fabrication, while the Betty Crocker is a very cheaply made and unconvincing machine. The blending shaft in particular is weak and prone to break easily, while the buttons are stiff. Moreover, its low power draw and weak vortex force means lots of pausing to shake out debris between the blades. The Cuisinart Smart Stick, however, is not without its usability issues. The controls, especially safety lock, is not so seamless and intuitive to use, and the strong suction force also led to numerous spills. There is, however, enough good value and worth in the Cuisinart whereas the Betty Corcker can only sit pretty on your counter.
