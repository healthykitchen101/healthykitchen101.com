The Ninja Foodi Power Mixer System and Peach Street serve different market segments. The Ninja is ideal for those who seek a high-performance blender that can handle a variety of tasks with ease. Its higher-powered 750-watt motor excels not only in standard blending but also in hand-mixer-relevant tasks like kneading dough and whisking egg whites, thanks to its multiple attachments.Â 

Meanwhile, the Peach Street targets users who prioritize affordability and have relatively light blending needs such as making soups, mayonnaise, or nut milk. Its key advantages include ease of attachment, removal, and cleaning, with a dishwasher-safe blending wand. However, it does fall short in terms of comfort during use due to notable motor vibration and hard-to-press buttons, and its metal blade guard can scratch the bottoms of blending containers, unlike the Ninja CI101 Foodi.
