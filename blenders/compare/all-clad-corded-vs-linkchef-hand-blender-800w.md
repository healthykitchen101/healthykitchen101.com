The LINKChef 800 W Hand Blender comes as a 5-part set, while the All Clad is just a blender stick. Performance wise, the All Clad is really only good for frozen fruit smoothies and almond milk. Its hot soup purees, like the LINKChef, are slightly below standard. The LINKChef, though, offers little performance advantage being  average at best for almond milk, and a flop with smoothies. For standard blending tasks, the All Clad is better, but if you really need a whisk, the LINKChef may be the choice for you.

On other fronts, the LINKChef shows good build quality for the price. The All Clad goes further with a quality beyond expectations, and it's a full 1.2 inches longer.  Despite this, the All Clad’s power acceleration is uneven so you need to move the rather heavy blender around a lot, plus there is a noticeable suction force to deal with. The LINKChef vibrates a lot, and with a reasonably noticeably suction force, spills do occur when you move the beaker while blending.
