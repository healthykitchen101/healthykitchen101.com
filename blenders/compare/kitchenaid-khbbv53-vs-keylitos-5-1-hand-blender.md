The KitchenAid Cordless is a great blender for fast and on-the-spot frozen smoothies, although it does require a bit of stopping and readjusting the shaft. They Keylitos, on the other hand, does not perform that well, especially for its price range. Both puree soups and frozen smoothies took longer than expected and still they were not as smooth as we had hoped. They Keylitos comes with a whisk so it is better for mayoanniase and whipped egg white compared to the  KitchenAid which has no extras. The Keylitos also comes with a beaker, a bottle brush, and a food processor. 

With the Keylitos you pay for more stuff, but its core performance with purees and smoothies is only average at best. The KitchenAid, although more basic, does an excellent job for what it should be capable of.
