The Oster Pro 1200 is an affordable yet efficient blender.  In comparison to the Ninja BN701, the Oster provides better value. Unlike the Ninja BN701, the Oster doesn't just rely on its sleek design or an array of attachments to impress. Instead, it shines in its ability to handle diverse tasks. Whether it's grinding tough nuts, blending leafy greens, or even crushing ice, its 1200-watt mot , combined with a well-designed blade system, does so with relative ease. 

Conversely, the Ninja BN701, while comparable in power, seems to focus its strengths more narrowly. In our test, it turned ice cubes into a snow-like consistency in a matter of seconds. This proficiency, however, did not extend as smoothly to other blending tasks, particularly those that involve fibrous or frozen ingredients.
