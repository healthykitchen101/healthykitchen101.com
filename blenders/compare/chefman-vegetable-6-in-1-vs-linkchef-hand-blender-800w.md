If accessories matter to you, the Chefman comes with a whisk, a spiralizer, and food processor with three different blade slicers. The LINKChefÂ  has a whisk, a milk frother, a simple food processor, and a beaker. With the Chefman you can get more done, but blending times are longer. The LINKChef flopped at frozen fruit smoothies, but was on par with the Chefman with most other tasks, although slightly better and faster with hot soup purees and almond milk.

Both these blenders have good build quality and offer good value for the price. The LINKChef offers 0.3 inches more on the shaft, but is 0.2 inches shorter on the cord. During blender, both blenders create a suction force that causes splatter when you move the beaker or container. However, the LINKChef has a noticeably strong vibration which makes it more difficult to handle. The Chefman only has two speeds and a pulse function, but there is not much difference between the 20 speeds on the LINKChef and the top-mounted dial can be cumbersome. At the end of the day, we preferred the Chefman.
