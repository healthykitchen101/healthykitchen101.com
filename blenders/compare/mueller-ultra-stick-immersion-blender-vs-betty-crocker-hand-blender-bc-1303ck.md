The Mueller Ultra-Stick is a pretty good average all-rounder in the blender ball park, and it does come with the nice extra of a milk frother. Apart from not having a whisk, the Betty Crocker can only measure up to the Mueller with hot soup purees, and is pretty dismal at making mayonnaise. From a simple performance value point of view, the Mueller is a much better proposition. 

Pushing things over the edge, the Betty Crocker is mostly made of pretty low grade plastic, including the blade guard. Additionally, the buttons proved stiff and difficult to use, while the poor vortex force led to frequent stopping and starting for most blending tasks.  The Meuller is not perfect, by a long shot, with clicky buttons that are annoying and uncomfortable. The  vortex force, although better than the Brtty Crocker, was a little lacking so we had to move the stick around often.
