In testing performance, the Braun’s 500-watt motor and ACTIVEBlade technology effortlessly blended dense smoothies, ground almonds, and puréed soups to smooth consistencies. Despite sharing the same motor power, the Mueller Ultra-Stick cannot match this efficiency. While it passed all of the five tests acceptably, the outcomes were not as uniformly smooth or consistent as those produced by the Braun.

The design of the Braun Multiquick-7 also outshines the Mueller. It's constructed with higher-quality materials which ensure greater durability and a more elegant appearance. At a more accessible price point, the Mueller is just averagely built, with blades that feel flimsy and may dull under regular use.

Usability-wise, the Braun Multiquick-7 features a user-friendly design with comfortable handling and easy-to-use controls, making the blending process both efficient and enjoyable. Meanwhile, the Mueller Ultra-Stick's controls can be tiresome, with buttons that have a very awkward clicky feel and may cause discomfort with prolonged use.
