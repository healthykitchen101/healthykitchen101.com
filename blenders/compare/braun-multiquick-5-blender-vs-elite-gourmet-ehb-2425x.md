Not many blenders can take down the Braun MultiQuick, but the Elite Gourmet put up a fair struggle with pureeing hot soups while taking the ground with mayonnaise. Other than that, its performance is comparatively lack-luster with fruit smoothies, almond milk, and whipping egg whites was a no-show (since it has no whisk). 

Compared to the Braun, the Elite Gourmet is a full 0.7 lbs lighter but for some it might lack sturdiness in the hand. Also, it doesn’t have proper anti-slip features or a rubberized handle. The Elite Gourmet is also a one speed machine and, with only 150 watts of power, it struggled to get some jobs done in time, but at least there were no suction issues. If you need something lights and easy just for soup purees, the Elite Gourmet may stand a chance. Otherwise, stick to the Braun for the best all rounder.
