The Braun Multiquick-7 is highly capable of blending frozen fruit smoothies, puréeing hot soups, and grinding nuts. Its 500-watt motor and ACTIVEBlade technology ensure consistent and smooth results without too much effort. The extra whisk attachment also allows it to easily create mayonnaise and whip egg whites into stiff peaks.

Sharing the same motor strength (500-watt), the Peach Street is comparable in performance to the Braun, except for whisking capability due to the lack of the whisk attachment. Nonetheless, our tests reveal that the Peach Street has drawbacks in usability; its tendency to vibrate at high speeds and the difficulty in pressing its buttons might impair your blending comfort.  

As such, despite the Peach Street's adequate capability and more affordable price, the Braun Multiquick-7’s user-friendly design makes it a preferable choice for any kitchen.
