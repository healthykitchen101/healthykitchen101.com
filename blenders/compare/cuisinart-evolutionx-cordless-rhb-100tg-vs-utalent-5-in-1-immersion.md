Neither the Cuisinart Evoltionx Cordless and the Utalent 5-In-1 are ideal blenders for standard tasks such as hot soup purees and frozen fruit smoothies. However, the Cuisinart does a slightly better job, but if you like a chunkier soup and can work a little longer to get your smoothies, it is not a bad choice. The performance of the Utalent is sub-standard all round, but the Cuisinart is actually a great blender for mayonnaise, almond milk, and whipped egg white.

The Utalent comes with a lot of extras, but they are all low quality plastic for the most part, including the inner core that connects the attachments to the blending shaft. Additionally, the blades are short so blending takes a long time and food often get stuck in between. The controls are easy to use, but the blender vibrates excessively and creates splatter. The Cuisinart, however, is a quality machine, except that it lacks the power and sophistication to do a really excellent job with purees and frozen fruit smoothies.
