The motors on these two blenders come with the same power rating. But in exchange for a higher price tag, an extra whisk attachment gives the Braun MultiQuick-5 greater versatility overall. You can get the full range of possibilities from blending solid foods to emulsifying sauces and whipping up egg whites.

Not only that, but our Braun also blends food much more harmoniously, though aesthetically it looks neither as solid nor as stylish as the Cuisinart.

In short, if you donâ€™t want to spend a fortune on a fancy blender like the Vitamix, but are still focused on versatility and high power output, consider buying the Braun MultiQuick-5 rather than the Cuisinart Smart Stick.
