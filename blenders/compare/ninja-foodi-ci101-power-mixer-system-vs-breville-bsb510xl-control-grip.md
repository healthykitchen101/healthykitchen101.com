While both blenders come with a hefty price tag, the Breville’s performance does not justify its cost as well as the Ninja Foodi. 

Equipped with a higher-powered 750-watt motor, the Ninja Foodi makes short work of even the most challenging ingredients, from fibrous nuts to frozen items. It can also multitask as a hand mixer, allowing you to knead dough or keep up with aeration tasks with finesse. 

Despite featuring premium features and solid construction, the Breville does not measure up in performance. It often struggles with basic tasks such as puréeing and blending frozen fruits, resulting in textures that fall short of expectations, if not too subpar for its price bracket. And although it can produce almond milk and whip egg whites to perfection, these capabilities are overshadowed by its overall inefficiency and the extended time it takes to complete these tasks.
