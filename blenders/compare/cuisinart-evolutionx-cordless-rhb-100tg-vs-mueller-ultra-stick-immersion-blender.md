For standard blending tasks, the Cuisinart Evolutionx Cordless only excels at making pretty smooth and tasty almond milk. Hot soup purees turn out a little lumpy while frozen fruit smoothies take time to battle through. The Whisk works really well though, whipping up almost perfect mayonnaise and even better whipped egg whites. In contrast, the Mueller Ultra-Stick is pretty average all round. It does slightly better than the Cuisinart with purees and smoothies, and all its performance scores were an acceptable average, showing a little more blending prowess for almond milk. 

In terms of design, the Cuisinart’s shaft is considerably longer, making it better for deeper pots. The Cuisinart look like a higher quality product, while the Mueller has rather flimsy looking blades that didn’t quite hole up to frozen fruit  smoothies. The buttons turned out a bit clicky and the top-mounted control inconvenient. The Cuisinart is an all round easier machine to use and the handle grip is particularly good. Except for hot soup purees, the Cuisinart is a much better prospect.
