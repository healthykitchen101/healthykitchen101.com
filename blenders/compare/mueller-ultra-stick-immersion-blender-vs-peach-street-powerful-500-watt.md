On paper, the Mueller Ultra Stick appears to be a better blender than the Peach Street Powerful. For one, the Peach Street comes with no extras, so it has no whisk or beaker. Therefore, it cannot whip up egg whites. However, the Peach Street will make you better hot soup puree and slightly smoother almond milk than the Mueller. Both fair equally well, with an average score, for frozen fruit smoothies. The only task the Muller comes out tops in is making Mayonnaise.

In terms of performance, which blender is better depends on what you need to do, keeping in mind the Mueller comes with a whisk and a milk frother. Both blenders show reasonable build quality for the price. A key difference is that the Peach Street has two speeds with two toggle buttons, while the Mueller has multiple speeds and top-mounted dial.Â  Unfortunately, both blenders vibrate excessively, but the Peach Street has additional issues with stiff buttons, so it is more tiring to use for long periods. Based on this, the Mueller is our preferred choice here.
