The Bella 10-Speed, which comes with a whisk, is a somewhat average blender stick but with exceptional prowess at making frozen fruit smoothies and mayonnaise. It didn’t do much more than ‘good enough’ for hot soup purees and almond-type milks, which were the strong points of the Peach Street Powerful 500. The Peach Street doesn’t come with a whisk, or even a beaker and food processor like the Bella, so it is a very basic blender choice.

On close-up inspection, we found the quality of these two blenders to be much the same, however, the blending shaft of the Bella is not as solid in design and appearance as the Peach Street. The Bella’s 10 speeds are controlled via a top-mounted dial, whereas the Peach Street has two speeds using toggle buttons. The Peach is easier to use in this regard, but both machines can tire out the arm because of the amount of shaking and vibration. At high speeds, the suction force of the Bella is quite extreme and impractical to use. If frozen smoothies and killer mayonnaise are your thing, go for the Belle, but the Peach Street is the better, all-round satisfactory choice.
