Our testing revealed significant limitations of the Hamilton Beach Wave Crusher. Despite a 700-watt motor, it struggled with blending both fresh and frozen fruits. It also didn't perform well in tasks such as liquefying leafy greens, making creamy almond butter, or crushing ice cubes. When compared to the Vitamix 5200, its efficiency is hard to match.Â 

Design-wise, the Hamilton disappoints somewhat. Its lower price point seems to compromise its durability, making it less sturdy than higher-end models like the Vitamix 5200. For users who need a blender for more demanding tasks and long-term durability, opting for the Vitamix 5200 would be a more sensible investment.
