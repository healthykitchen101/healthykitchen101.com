Both blenders are indeed worth buying, but their suitability depends on your specific requirements.Â 

The Cuisinart RHB-100TG EvolutionX, as a cordless hand blender, brings exceptional ease of use and flexibility to the table. This makes it an excellent choice for those who value the convenience of cord-free operation, whether for use in different parts of the kitchen or for ease of storage. While it might not have the raw power of some corded models, it delivers performance that is more than satisfactory for everyday kitchen tasks.

The Ninja CI101 Foodi, on the other hand, is a heavy-duty corded blender. Capable of handling diverse and challenging tasks, this blender goes beyond simple blending. Whether it's blending smoothies, kneading dough, or whisking egg whites, the Ninja CI101 will be your reliable all-in-one solution.
