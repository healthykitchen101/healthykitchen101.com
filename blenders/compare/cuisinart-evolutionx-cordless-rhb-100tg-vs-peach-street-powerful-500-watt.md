The simple choice between the Cuisinart Evolutionx Cordless and the Peach Street Powerful, is whether or not you need a whisk for better mayonnaise making and whipping up egg whites. If you don’t need a whisk the Peach Street is better, especially for hot soup purees and frozen fruit smoothies. With the Cuisinart, soups come out rather lumpy and the blender grapples with frozen fruit smoothies. For these standard jobs, the Peach Street is better, but not the absolute best by a long margin. 

The Cuisinart sports an all-round more robust design, especially the blade, while the Peach Street has a plastic look and feel. The Peach Street may have a simpler interface, but the buttons are stiff and blender vibrates and moves around a lot. Meanwhile the Cuisinart is highly responsive with minimal vibration, splashing, or suction force. At the end of the day, the Cuisinart is easier to use, more versatile, and shows better overall build quality, but unfortunately the design is lacking in the two most fundamental tasks: blending purees and making frozen fruit smoothies.
