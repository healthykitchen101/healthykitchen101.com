The LINKChef Hand Blender proved to be no match for the Cuisinart Evolutionx, especially with standard blending tasks. The LINKChef failed dismally in our frozen fruit smoothie test and was mediocre at best with almond milk. It does a good job with mayonnaise and whipped egg whites, and blended hot soup purees just a little bit better than the Cuisinart; but the trade off was a problematic suction force.

In terms of usability, the LINKChef vibrates quite significantly, the top-mounted controls are cumbersome, and the grip is not as secure as the Cuisinart. Being a lower-priced blender, the LINKChef also used more plastic parts, but the quality is a match to the price. Overall, the Cuisinart has excellent build quality, is easier to use then the LINKChef with generally better results and greater versatility.
