The Betty Crocker is a simple blending stick with no whisk attachment, but it comes with a beaker. The Keylitos is a 5-in-1 set that includes a food processor, whisk, milk frother, and beaker. The Betty Croker is adequate for making purees, nut milks, and mayonnaise. However, the performance markers of the Keylitos are far superior with purees and frozen fruit smoothies a good average, and other tasks excellent. A key difference is that the Betty Crocker proved inadequate for making frozen fruit smoothies.Â 

The Keylitos shows good build quality for its price, but the Betty Crocker is largely composed of low-grade plastic and appears fragile. The Keylitos is well-designed, but the top controls can be cumbersome, whereas we found the turbo function to be highly effective. For the Keylitos, there is some vibration and suction force to deal with, but the Betty Crocker was difficult to maneuver, it splattered a lot, and the vortex was weak leading to continual stopping and starting.
