The Betty Crocker is an average performer for the tasks it can do. Like the Peach Street Powerful, it doesn’t have a whisk for whipping egg whites. Furthermore, it couldn’t muster enough power to blend a frozen fruit smoothie. The Peach Street, meanwhile, is above par for almond milk and hot soup purees, and acceptably average for frozen fruit smoothies and mayonnaise. That said, the Peach Street does have several usability issues. 

The Peach Street has reasonably good build quality and value for the price. However, one issue is that buttons are stiff and it becomes tiring to hold them down for extended periods of time. Also, it vibrates considerably, acceleration is uneven, and the powerful suction force all result in user fatigue. The Betty Crocker is largely made of plastic and poor quality parts. The blade design and lack of a good vortex force leads to splattering and disruptions during blending. These issues, and the low quality, make the Betty Crocker a blender not worth considering.
