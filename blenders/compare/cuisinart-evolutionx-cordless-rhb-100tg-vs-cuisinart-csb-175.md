In the Cuisinart versus Cuisinart standoff, the Cuisinart Smart Stick does a better job all round, except it doesn’t come with a whisk, but it is not the easiest blender to work with.  The Smart Stick works faster than  the Evolutionx Cordless, and it produces slightly smoother and less chunky blends, including really smooth almond milk. The Evolutionx is only slightly better at mayonnaise and has the added advantage of having a whisk for doing egg whites. 

Both these Cuisinart blenders show a comparable and high-quality build, and they are also of a similar size and weight.  One issue, however, with the Smart Stick is the design of the blade guard which leads to heavy scratching on the beaker sides. Overall, the Evolutionx is a much more user-friendly blender. The Smart Stick also proved cumbersome in learning how to use and operate the lock function, and its strong suction force led to splatters and difficulties at the end of the blending process. In conclusion, the Evolutionx is a good all-rounded with great design and it is easy to use. The Smart Stick impresses more with results, but is not the easiest of blenders to get used to.
