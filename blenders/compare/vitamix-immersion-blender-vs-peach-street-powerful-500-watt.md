In testing, we found that the Vitamix and Peach Street come with distinct performance capabilities. As a heavy-duty blender, the Vitamix can puree soups to a silky consistency and easily breeze through frozen fruits. Its 4-prong blade and high rotation speed also allow it to competently handle tasks like mayonnaise and almond milk preparation.

Neither blender offers whipping capabilities, as they lack the whisking attachment common in many modern immersion blenders. However, the Peach Street proves to be a less efficient blender. Its lower-powered 500-watt motor is adequate for basic blending tasks such as soup pureeing and smoothie making, but not without requiring extra effort and time.

Design-wise, the Vitamix's sturdy stainless steel construction contrasts with the Peach Street's more budget-conscious design, which features medium-quality plastic. Additionally, the Vitamix's ergonomic design offers a more comfortable and controlled blending experience. Despite its larger-than-average size, it ensures comfortable one-handed operation with gradual acceleration that minimizes splattering. Whereas, the Peach Street comes with significant motor vibration and hard-to-press buttons that impact the overall user experience, although it is lighter and more compact.
