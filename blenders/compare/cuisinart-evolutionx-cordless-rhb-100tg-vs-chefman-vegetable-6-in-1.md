The Chefman comes with a whisk and a number of food processing spiralizers. Perhaps this can sweeten the deal, but its blending prowess have much to be desired. Standard tasks like making hot soup purees were mediocre at very best, leaving behind a fair bit of lumpiness and it took its sweet time to get the smoothies smooth. The Cuisinart while a notch better at these tasks, only excelled at making almond milk, almost to perfection, and creating perfectly whipped egg whites. It comes with only a whisk and a beaker.

The Cuisinart has a slightly longer shaft and a better overall look and finish. Its blade design is better evidenced by minimal suction force and splashing, while the Chefman creates quite some vacuum and food particles stuck between the blades. Both machines, however, are responsive and easy to use except that the Chefman doesnâ€™t have a non-slip grip but it still worked fine.
