The LINKChef hand blender is no match for the all-powerful Braun, especially when it comes to performance. Oddly enough, the LINKChef only excelled at whipping up egg whites and making mayonnaise—even outperforming the Braun with the latter. However, while the LINKChed doesn’t blend to the smoothest texture, it is nonetheless acceptable for standard home made preparations.

 A key design caveat with the LINKCHef is its extra long shaft that makes it a good pick for larger pots. Its overall build quality matches its lower price point, so the Braun is the better quality machine. The blending shaft and beaker, however, are a good match to the Braun. In terms of ease of use, the LINKChef has two things to be aware of. The speed controls are inconveniently situated on the top of the shart, and the moto has quite a powerful vibration. Other than that, there is not much difference in how the blenders assemble or how easily they are to clean.
