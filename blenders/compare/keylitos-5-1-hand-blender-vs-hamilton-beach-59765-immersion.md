The Hamilton Beach 2 Speed is somewhat compact compared to most other hand blenders, but unfortunately this doesnâ€™t translate well into any kind of performance advantage. The Hamilton could only whip up some pride with hot soup purees creating a slightly smoother texture than the Keylitos. With other tasks, the Keylitos was above average to excellent, although frozen fruit smoothies took twice the average amount of time.

Despite its reputable name, this Hamilton Beach had somewhat inferior plastic parts compared to the Kaylitos. Also, its blade appeared a bit flimsy and tended to grate the sides of containers. The Keylitos demonstrated much better quality, even for its price, and it also proved much easier to use than the Hamilton. The Hamilton, not to mention its shorter shaft by an inch, tended to get quite hot and the vibrational force was difficult to handle at times.
