Breville might be a fancy name in the kitchen, but this BSB510XL Control Grip blender appeared not to make a mark. Although frozen fruit smoothies took up to a minute or longer than the standard benchmark, it did produce some of the best and smoothest results. Hot soup purees were not as good, but very acceptable nonetheless. The disappointment, however, was how long the whisk took to make mayonnaise. On paper, the Cuisinart may appear to be the better blender, but it didn’t get as good results although it worked faster.

Both Cuisinart and Breville are known as high-quality brands. Their quality will not disappoint, but the Breville blade is distinctive for its one sharp and one dull blade, which don’t work so well with hard things like ice and nuts without liquid added. The Breville shaft may be longer by an inch, but it is almost twice as heavy as the Cuisinart. Both blenders are really easy to control, but the Breville does generate some strong suction force when moving it around. Ultimately, the Cuisinart is a good choice for its cordless convenience, superiority at whisking, and it is also lighter.
