In testing, the Ninja CI101 Foodi stood out as a highly versatile and efficient appliance. Its 750-watt motor powered through a range of tasks with ease. From blending tough ingredients like frozen fruits and raw nuts to more delicate operations such as emulsifying sauces and whisking egg whites, this blender demonstrated its capability as an all-rounder.  

The Chefman 6-in-1, while offering an affordable option with a generous accessory package, reveals significant limitations in its blending performance. Its 300-watt motor was noticeably less capable, particularly when dealing with more demanding blending tasks. The results, therefore, were often just average, lacking the finesse and consistency achieved by the Ninja CI101 Foodi. 

In terms of usability, the Chefman 6-in-1 is relatively straightforward, but it lacks the refined ergonomics of the Ninja. This shortfall, coupled with its mediocre blending capabilities, makes it a less appealing option when compared to the more capable and user-friendly Ninja CI101 Foodi.
