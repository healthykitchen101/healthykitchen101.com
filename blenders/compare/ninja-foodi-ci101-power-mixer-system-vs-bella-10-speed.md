The Ninja Foodi is a powerhouse, designed for heavy blending performance. Its high-powered 750-watt motor and ability to convert into a hand mixer make it a decent tool for blending, whisking, and even kneading. 

In contrast, the Bella 10-Speed is a basic, mid-range immersion blender. While it performs comparatively well in making smoothies and mayonnaise, its capabilities of pureeing soup, whipping eggs,  and creating almond milk are not as impressive as those of the Ninja Foodi. 

When it comes to design and ease of use, the Ninja CI101 Foodi Power Mixer System and the BELLA 10-Speed Hand Blender also offer contrasting experiences. 

The Ninja CI101 is recognized for its luxurious visual appeal and thoughtful design. It features straightforward controls, easy-to-change attachments, and lots of user-friendly features like the bell-shaped blade guard that reduces mess and suction effect. Despite its heavier build, the Ninja CI101 offers a more refined and comfortable blending experience. 

Whereas, the BELLA is built with medium-grade plastic parts and is designed for compactness and portability. It is more suitable for tight spaces and quick small-scale blenders. However, we found issues with excessive vibration, stiff buttons, and a blending shaft that creates too much suction, which can make the blending process challenging.
