The Vitamix 5-speed offers a more comprehensive, professional experience. While it is suitable for a wide array of tasks, the Elite Gourmet caters to basic, less frequent blending needs with its simpler design. In our tests, this blender significantly outperformed the Elite Gourmet across all tasks. From making frozen fruit smoothies to pureeing soups, producing nut milk, and emulsifying mayonnaise, its results were consistently excellent.

Design-wise, the Vitamix boasts a sleek, professional appearance. Its stainless steel construction shows careful engineering, with attention to details such as blade construction, motor housing, and overall ergonomics. Although its larger size and heft might be cumbersome for some users, these features can be beneficial for stability during blending and contribute to the structural integrity of the blender.Â 

Meanwhile, the Elite Gourmet, appearing lighter and more compact with a flimsy plastic finish, offers ease of handling and storage, but at the cost of reduced stability and effectiveness when blending larger quantities or denser materials.
