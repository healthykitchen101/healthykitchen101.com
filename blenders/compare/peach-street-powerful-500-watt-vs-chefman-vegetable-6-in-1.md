The Chefman Vegetable Slicer impresses with its extras, but we were just interested in its blender. Vegetable slicing aside, the Chefman was below par for all major blending tasks including hot soup purees, frozen fruit smoothies, and nut milks like almond. However, the key issue was more the time it took while the results themselves were quite acceptable for a home cook. The whisk did a great job with mayonnaise and especially egg whites, which was a bonus. That said, the Peach Street is above average for most tasks, and does a good job with mayonnaise despite not having a whisk.

The Peach Street doesnâ€™t come with any extra and has good build quality for the price. The buttons were a little stiff to press, the stick vibrated a little too much for our liking, and we had to grapple sometimes with a strong suction force. The Chefman was an easier blender to handle than the Peach Street. The buttons were more responsive and the suction force was minimal. The extras that come with the Chefman may compensate, and its performance is not too bad.
