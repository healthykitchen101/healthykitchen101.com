The Betty Crocker is one of the all-round poorest blenders we have tested, yet the Hamilton Beach 2 Speed was unable to convince us of much.  The Hamilton Beach is essentially a budget option for a blender set that includes a whisk and a small food processor, while the only extras with the Betty Crocker is a blending beaker. The Hamilton Beach managed to stiffen up egg whites, but it took almost twice the average time, which was a key issue with this blender in general. This slow speed couldn’t do much for a frozen fruit smoothie, mayonnaise was a no-go, and almond milk a little coarse in texture.

The Betty Crocker didn’t fare much better, but could at least do semi-descent almond milk, an average hot soup puree, and just about acceptable mayonnaise. Design-wise the Hamilton Beach is 0.6 inches shorter on the blending stick and has slightly better material quality for the blade, not that this proved much of an advantage. The Betty Crocker has stiff buttons while the Hamilton Beach tends to get rather hot. At the end of the day, there are better budget choices for both a blender set and a single blender stick.
