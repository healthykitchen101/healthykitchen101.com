The Betty Crocker Hand Blender may sound like a lot of fun, but its performance cannot measure up to the KitchenAid Cordless.  They do equally well with hot soup purees, smooth enough with a few rougher bits here and there. However, the Betty Corcker is dismal at frozen smoothies, mediocre at best with mayonnaise and almond milk, while the Chefman is easily competitive in the top range for these. Neither do whipped egg whites because neither have a whisk. 

In terms of accessories, the Betty Crocker at least has a nice beaker, while the Chefman compensates with a blade guard for when out of use. Unfortunately, the Betty Crocker does ot have the most robust construction, the shaft is weak and prone to break easily, and the blades tend to be quite susceptible to rust. The grip is poor, the buttons stiff, and it vibrates excessively.  As one can tell, there is not much advantage to even considering the Betty Crocker as an alternative to the Chefman, or any other blender.
