The Utalent 5-in-1 Immersion Blender and the Betty Crocker Hand Blender go hand-in-hand in that both are low quality with corresponding poor performance. The Betty Crocker at least does an average to acceptable job with hot soup purees, almond milk, and mayonnaise, but it cannot power through a frozen fruit smoothie and lacks a whisk for beating egg whites. The Utalent was slow and couldn’t muster enough power to produce anything more than subpar results with most blending tasks. It was good, however, with whipping up mayonnaise. 

Both these blenders use plastic parts of low quality, especially for the shaft joinings. The Utalent has a useful turbo function, but even still, the button was stiff and demanding. The Betty Crocker is just a two speed blender. In terms of the blade, the Utalent shows better quality, but the four-blade design is not as effective as the two-blade design of the Betty Crocker. The Utalent has a strong vibration and suction force, while the Betty Crocker lacks significant vortex. That saint, neither of these two blenders have much to offer.
