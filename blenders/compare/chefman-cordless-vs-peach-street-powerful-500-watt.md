Neither of these blenders come with a whisk attachment, so if you want perfectly whipped egg whites, these may not be the best choice. Of the two, The Chefman Cordless is a great blender for everything, except that hot soup purees tend to take longer on average. The Peach Street is a little faster at purees, but at the same time it generates more suction which can be annoying. Furthermore, it took more effort and hand movements to get frozen smoothies going, but the end results were good. This, and the strong suction, is a general issue of concern for this blender.Â 

What can be said from all this, is that Chefman Cordless is a much easier blender to handle, less tiring, and it gets things done faster. Both blenders show good workmanship with the blades, the the casing of the Peach Street is not well-finished. In essence, the Chefman Cordless proved easy to use with its pressure sensitive speed control, while the Peach Street was often stiff and unresponsive. I took more effort to control it with its suction problems and poor maneuverability.
