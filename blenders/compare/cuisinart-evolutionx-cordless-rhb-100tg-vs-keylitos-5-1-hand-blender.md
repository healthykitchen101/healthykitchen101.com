In terms of overall performance, the Keylitos is a slightly better blender than the Cuisinart Evolutionx Cordless. This is particularly so for hot soup purees which turn out rather more lumpier using the Cuisinart. Other scores for mayonnaise, almond milk, and whipped egg whites are only marginally better with the Cuisinart. The deciding factor between these two blenders is basically design quality, ease of use, and the convenience of cordless blending.

The Keylitos comes with more attachments like a food blender and a milk frother, while both sets have a whisk and a beaker. Despite the draw of extra stuff, the Cuisinart trumps the Keylitos with better build quality, especially for the blade and it has a longer shaft. The Cuisinart was also a lot easier to use, largely due to the Keylitos having top-mounted controls and the Cuisinart a better grip. That said, the Keylitos has a super convenient turbo function which does offer something extra.
