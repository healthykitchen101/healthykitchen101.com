Despite not matching the Braun Multiquick-7 in terms of efficiency, the KOIOS 4-in-1 still holds its ground in practical performance. In our tests, it blended frozen fruit smoothies, puréed soups, emulsified mayonnaise, and even whisked egg whites quite effectively. Most of the outcomes were far from perfect and not as smooth as those produced by the Braun Multiquick-7, but they all came out with acceptable textures. 

Design-wise, the Braun Multiquick-7 stands out with its sleek, solid construction, in contrast to the KOIOS's average build quality, yet is priced more accessible. 

Consequently, the choice between these blenders hinges on what you value more: the Braun Multiquick-7 is a worthy investment for those seeking heavy blending performance and top-notch features, whereas the KOIOS’s adequate capability appeals to those who seek functionality and affordability in one package.
