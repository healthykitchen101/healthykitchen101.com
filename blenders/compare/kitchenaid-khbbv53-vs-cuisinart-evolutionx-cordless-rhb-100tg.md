The Cuisinart Evolutionx Cordless is a great blender for things like almond milk, mayonnaise, and whipped egg whites. However, it proved lack-luster with hot purees and frozen smoothies. In general, the blender lacks power and requires move time and maneuvering to get the job done well. The KitchenAid cordless, on the other hand, does an excellent job with standard puree and smoothie tasks, but it doesn’t come with a whisk, so mayonnaise making is more challenging.

A key design difference between these two cordless blenders is that the CuisinArt is much lighter with a slightly longer shaft. The CuisinArt has a better finish and the shaft appears to be of a higher quality compared to the KitchenAid. Despite its core performance not being quite up to standard, the Cuisinart is easier to handle and operate. It has minimal suction force and a low operational sound. The KitchenAid’s suction force requires more handling, the grip is a bit slippery, the speed control tricky, and it requires more effort to take apart.
