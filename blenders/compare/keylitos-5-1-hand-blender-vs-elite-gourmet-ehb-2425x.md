The Keylitos 5-in-1 is hands down a far superior blender compared to the Elite Gourmet. The Elite Gourmet was only slightly better at hot soup purees, but the Keylitos ranged from acceptable to excellent for all other tasks. Frozen fruit smoothies may take a little longer, and soups are a tad lumpy at times, but the Keylitos is a good all round blender that won’t let you down. What’s more, it comes as a set with a food processor, whisk, milk frother, and beaker. 

If anything, this Elite Gourmet is a small personal blender good for basically blending soups. Its shaft is a full 1.2 inches shorter than the Keylitos, and while Keylitos incorporates brushed stainless steel into the blender shaft, the Gourmet is entirely composed of low grade plastic. The Keylitos has 12 speeds and an excellent turbo function, but do you have to contend with some vibrational force and suction pull. With a low power rating of only 150 W, you often have to stop, shake out stuck food, and restart when using the not so Elite Gourmet.
