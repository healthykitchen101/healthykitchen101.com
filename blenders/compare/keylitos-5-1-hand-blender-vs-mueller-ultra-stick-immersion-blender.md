The Keylitos 5-in-1 is a superior choice of  blender all round when compared to the Mueller Ultra-Stick. For hot soup purees, it was somewhat above average while the Mueller left behind a few more lumpy bits. Both were average at best for frozen fruit smoothies; and although the Keylitos takes twice the time, it gets you a decent smoothie while the Meuller still leaves you chunky bits of fruit. For other tasks such as almond milk, mayonnaise, and whipped egg whites the Keylitos excels above average while the Mueller falls below par.

In terms of build quality, there is not much difference between the two, except the Keylitos has a better blade design and 12 speeds compared to the Meuller’s eight. The Meuller disappoints with its ineffective turbo speed, the whisk is poor quality, as evidenced by the  mayonnaise and egg white tests, and it doesn’t come with a blending beaker. By comparison, the Keylitos is easier to handle, with less vibrational force and an overall better grip and balance. The Meuller proved a little tiring after a while.
