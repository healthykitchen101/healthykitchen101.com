If youÂ  need a semi decent blender for frozen fruit smoothies, the All Clad is the one to go for. Its only disadvantage compared to the Cuisinart EvolutionX Cordless, is the lack of a whisk which reduces its versatility, and hence also its performance score. There is not a lot of difference between how these two machines handle soup purees and almond milk. With the All Clad, soups come out a little rough but not as clumpy as the Cuisinart, while the Cuisinart will give your almond milk a slightly smoother edge.

The All Clad may have an extra long shaft, but at the same time it is a little heavy. In addition, power and speed changes are not smooth and these require extra effort to maneuver. Food also tends to get lodged in the blade guards. The Cuisinart, however, is smooth and easy to use, and the handle grip is slightly better. The All Clad shows slightly better performance for key tasks, but is that worth the extra effort?
