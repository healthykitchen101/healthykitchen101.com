Neither the All Clad nor the Betty Crocker have a whisk which somewhat limits their functionality, such as whipping up egg whites. The Betty Crocker does come with a beaker, but the All Clad is just a single blender stick. The Betty Corcker’s performance is average but acceptable for hot soup purees, almond milk, and mayonnaise. Soup purees turn out a little lumpier with the All Clad, but almond milk and frozen fruit smoothies were very good. The only performance advantage the Betty Crocker has is that it can mix up a semi-descent mayonnaise whereas it fails with frozen smoothies.

The All Clad is far superior in terms of  build quality, even compared to top performing blenders like the Braun. The Betty Crocker is largely made of cheap plastic, even for the shaft internals. It seemed to lack power, so the vortex was weak and the blender was prone to spilling when moved. For the All Clad, the power is good but acceleration is not smooth and the suction is quite tight. Despite performance pitfalls like soup purees and mayonnaise, the All Clad is the better choice here.
