The Utalent 5-in-1 is a blender that fails to impress with its overall performance. Standard blending tasks such as hot soup purees, frozen fruit smoothies, and almond milk were all below par. It only excelled with mayonnaise and egg whites took a long time. The key issue is the time it takes to blend coupled with a tendency for the motor to get quite hot in the process. The LINKChef, meanwhile, is a decent quality blender except that it fails at making frozen fruit smoothies.Â 

The low quality of the Utalent is evident by the low-grade plastic parts, especially those that form part of the shaft assembly. The LINKChef shows decent quality all-round for the price you pay. It uses a mid-grade plastic mixed with metal. A key difference between the design is that the Utalent uses a four-blade design which seemed to be less effective than the standard two-blade design. Both these blenders were similar in the strong vibration force and suction that often led to spills when moving the beaker during blending.
