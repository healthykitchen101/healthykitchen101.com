If you like your hot soup purees completely smooth, the Elite Gourmet Immersion Blender may be the one for you, but its poor build quality makes the Cuisinart Smart Stick a much better proposition. Neither blender has a whisk for whipped egg whites, but the Cuisinart does include a beaker. The Cuisinart is competitively excellent at almond milk and mayonnaise, while maintaining a good average for hot soup puree and frozen fruit smoothies, although neither have the smoothest texture. The Elite Gourmet, at least, smooths the job over with quality hot soup purees.

While the Cuisinart has a quality to it you can expect from the brand, the Elite Gourmet is made mostly of low grade plastic and some parts, including the shaft and the blade, which appeared very flimsy. The low 150 W power draw of the Elite Gourmet could never muster up enough vortex force which resulted in much stopping and restarting. The Elite Gourmet also lacks a proper grip and is cumbersome to put together easily. That said, the Cuisinart Smart stick has its own usability issues such as difficult to use controls and powerful suction force that causes spills.
