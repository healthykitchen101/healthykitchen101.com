The Ninja AMZ493BRN, with its focus on versatility, offers a range of containers and functions like smoothie making, dough kneading, and food processing. This makes it become more appealing to those seeking a multifunctional blender at a moderate price. However, our tests revealed that it often struggles with even basic tasks like making fibrous green smoothies. This shortcoming is likely linked to its blade design; stacked blades might chop ingredients effectively, but they can disrupt the smooth circular motion needed to pull ingredients down towards the blades.Â 

In contrast, the Vitamix 5200 consistently excels across a wide range of tasks, from simple purees to challenging frozen blends. Its ease of use, with less need for manual intervention and straightforward cleaning, also contrasts sharply with the operational inconveniences of the Ninja AMZ493BRN.
