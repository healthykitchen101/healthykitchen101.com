The battle between the Chefman Cordless and the Keylitos 5 in 1 seems to be a toss up between fruit smoothies and egg whites. Which one of the budget runners to choose really depends on what you need to do with your blender. 

Both were equally matched for puree hot soups, with the Keylitos  slightly better with the former and Chefman with the latter.  However, Chefman pipped the post with smoothies. It had no trouble get the job done fast and efficiently, while the Keylitos was difficult to handle, took time, and the results were not so fine. However, the Keylitos proved better at mayonnaise partly because it has a whisk attachment. Since the Chefman has no whisk, beating egg-white is out of the question, and this is an important fact to take into consideration. 

The Chefman is defined by its cordless convenience, while the Keylitos boasts up to 12 different speeds and showed better workmanship with the blades. It should be pointed out that the Chefman doesn’t have a pulse function. Both are easy to use, assemble, and clean. The Keylitos proved a bit tricky with its top-mounted control dial, but the convenient turbo function often got us to where we needed to go.
