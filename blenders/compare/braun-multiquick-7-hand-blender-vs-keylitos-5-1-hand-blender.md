In a direct comparison where both the Braun Multiquick-7 and the Keylitos 5-in-1 pass a series of five tests with above-average results, subtle yet significant differences are revealed, particularly in terms of speed, the outcome’s smoothness, build quality, and overall usability.

Even with a less powerful 500-watt motor, the Braun Multiquick-7 consistently outshone the Keylitos's 800-watt motor in four out of five tests. Particularly, in the soup puréeing test, it came impressively close to delivering the perfect purée, whereas the Keylitos still left small, unprocessed bits behind. When it came to processing frozen fruits and grinding raw almonds, the Braun's results were also noticeably smoother and achieved faster. 

Design-wise, the Braun Multiquick-7 appears to have a higher standard. Its user-friendly design, combined with a sturdy build, enhances the overall user experience. While the Keylitos is functionally adequate with a balanced construction and comfortable handle, it faces issues with the motor's excessive vibration strong and suction at the bottom of the container, complicating maneuverability. 

In conclusion, the Braun Multiquick-7 is a worthwhile investment for those willing to pay a premium for top-tier performance, smooth blending results, and build quality. Meanwhile, the Keylitos 5-in-1 is a fine choice with adequate functionality yet at a more budget-friendly price point.
