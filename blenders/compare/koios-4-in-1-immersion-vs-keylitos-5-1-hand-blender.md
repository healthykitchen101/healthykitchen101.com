These two blenders are quite closely matched, despite being only average to good for the most part. THe Keylitos is particularly good at making  mayonnaise, almond milk, and whipped egg whites, even comparable to top-range blenders. Bother blenders are average to good at making hot soup purees, so not the smoothest you can get. Making frozen fruit smoothies is the only performance advantage that the KOIOS has over the Keylitos.

Both these blenders come as sets which include a whisk and a food processor, but the Keylitos has an additional latte whisker. Their building quality is very similar incorporating brushed stainless steel and plastic, a turbo function, and both  have 12 top-mounted speed controls. One design difference with the Keylitos is that it is half the weight of the KOIS, weighing only 1.6 lbs with little discernible difference in performance ratings.
