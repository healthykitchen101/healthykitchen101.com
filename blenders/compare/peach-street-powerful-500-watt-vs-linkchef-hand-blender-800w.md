The LINKChef 800 W is a blender set with various attachments, but its only caveat is a good whisk that makes great mayonnaise and stiff egg whites. Other standard blending tasks are average at very best and it fails to muster enough power to do a frozen fruit smoothie. The Peach Street, without the fancy extras, is an all round descent blender. It is above par for hot soup purees and almond milk, but pretty average for frozen fruit smoothies and mayonnaise. The smoothies actually came out well, but good ease-of-use and handling detracted from the final result.

The issue with the Peach Street is that it vibrates heavily and the strong suction force often means having to move the blender around. The uneven acceleration speeds also tend to result in uneven blending results. The LINKChef has similar issues, but with the Peach Street at least you get better results. If itâ€™s the blender you want, the Peach Street is the obvious choice.
