The Ninja Foodi Power Mixer System is praised for its multi-purpose use and versatility as both an immersion blender and a hand mixer. It excels in blending hot ingredients directly in a pot and can produce a very smooth purée with fibrous ingredients like kale. Although not exceptionally good at processing frozen items, it comes with a pair of beaters for making cookie dough or cake batter, and a whisk attachment for whipping cream or stirring salad dressing. The Ninja Foodi is sturdy, easy to clean, and has great build quality, making it suitable for both home and professional use.

The Hamilton Beach 59765, on the other hand, is a budget-friendly option that falls short in nearly every performance test. Its 225-watt motor often performs poorly with solid ingredients like frozen fruits, fibrous greens, and raw nuts, and the included whisk attachment is somewhat ineffective in making mayonnaise. The Hamilton’s design feels relatively cheap and flimsy, and its blending shaft is too short to immerse in deep pots. Not only this, but the sharp, metal blade guard could seriously damage your blending container.
