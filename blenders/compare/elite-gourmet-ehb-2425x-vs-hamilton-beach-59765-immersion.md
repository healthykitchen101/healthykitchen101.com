The Elite Gourmet is a one-stick no-fuss budget blender. It has no accessories or and no speed adjustment. The Hamilton Beach 2-Speed is a budget option blender set with a whisk and a food processor.  The Elite Gourmet will do an above average to excellent job with almond milk, hot soup purees, and mayonnaise respectively. However, it has no whisk for beating egg whites, and it lacks sufficient vortex force to pulverize a frozen fruit smoothie. The Hamilton Beach, by comparison, is a flop at mayonnaise, and offers no advantage for any other blending tasks, with frozen smoothies and whipped egg whites being well under par.

Unfortunately, the Elite Gourmet has a poor build quality, which is what you get for the price. It is largely made of plastic parts, including the blade guard and shaft joinings, which probably won’t last long under heavy strain. With the Hamilton Beach you get better material quality, but the buttons are stiff and unresponsive, it vibrates a lot, and the motor tends to get quite hot. There are much better blender sets than the Hamilton. However, for light and occasional blending tasks, the Elite Gourmet is not a bad budget option.
