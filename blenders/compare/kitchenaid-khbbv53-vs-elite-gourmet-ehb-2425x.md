The one ‘downfall’ of the Elite Gourmet is its inability to really make good frozen fruit smoothies. The main issue seems to be the relatively poor quality of the blade and the blender’s low power rating. It fairs better with hot soup purees, but not with the smoothest texture. For some reason, it is a great blender for mayonnaise despite not having a whisk attachment. The KitchenAid, on the other hand, is a good all-rounder. It is particularly good at frozen fruit smoothies while soup purees and almond milk are better than average.

The KitchenAid doesn’t have a sleek high-quality look, but it is solid and well-built. It is quite powerful, but with a strong suction force making it difficult to control. It also took a bit of practice to get skillful with the controls. The Elite Gourmet, unfortunately, shows poor design and lower quality materials. Especially the shaft is rather short and not so good for tall pots.
