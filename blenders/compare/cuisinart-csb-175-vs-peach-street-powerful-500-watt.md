Both the Cuisinart Smart Stick and the Peach Street Powerful are straight up immersion blender sticks with no additional attachments, except that the Cuisinart has a blending beaker. Neither of these hand blenders therefore have whisk for egg whites, but the Cuisinart can still blend up great mayonnaise whereas the Peach Street flounders. The Peach Street is actually the slightly better blender for hot soup purees, while the Cuisinart is a better choice for frozen fruit smoothies and almond milk. Overall, their performance scores turned out exactly the same. 

Apart from personal needs and preferences, the real toss up between these two blenders lies in quality and ease of use. The Cuisinart has a higher perceived quality, while the Peach Street looks more budget-like. Peach Street has a unique blade design which happens to make cleaning easier. Both use a two switch, two speed operation but the Cuisinart’s safety locking feature makes it cumbersome to adjust speeds while blending. This Cuisinart, unfortunately, has quite a strong suction force that often creates a mess. On its downside, the Peach Street has stiff buttons and inconsistent blending results from excessive motor vibrations. It’s a tough choice either way.
