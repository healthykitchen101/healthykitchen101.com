The Black+Decker Crush Master, with a 550-watt motor, can handle a range of tasks. In our test, it produced above-average results in creating almond butter, protein shakes, and green smoothies. Although its performance in blending frozen fruits was somewhat lacking, it still managed to outperform the Hamilton Beach Wave Crusher. The Hamilton Beach, despite its higher-powered 700-watt motor, fell short in four out of five tests. It only passed the protein shake test. Neither blender proved capable of effectively crushing ice cubes.

In terms of design, both blenders are constructed with materials that are sufficient for everyday use but may not offer the sleek and robustness of higher-end models. Usability-wise, the Black+Decker's tendency to produce a plastic smell during use while the Hamilton Beach's unyielding buttons and hard-to-remove lid might impair your overall blending experience.
