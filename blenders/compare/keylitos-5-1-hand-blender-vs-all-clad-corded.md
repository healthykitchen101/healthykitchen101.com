Making a choice between these two blenders based on performance alone is challenging. The All Clad Corded, not having a whisk attachment, failed to make any headway with mayonnaise and whipped egg whites. The Keylitos 5-in-1 and the All Clad  both made smooth almond milk, although not with a real silky texture. With the other two key blending tasks, the All Clad excelled with frozen fruit smoothies, but was well below par with hot soup purees. For both these key tasks, the Keylitos was good enough for basic home cooking. 

On closer inspection, however, the All Clad blade showed a far superior build quality to the Keylitos. However, its curved blade and the more enclosed blade guard design seemed not to work well with hot soup purees and mayonnaise. The Keylitos was responsive and comfortable to handle for the most part. The All Clad, however, did not accelerate smoothly, the suction force was quite strong at times, and the blade design also required extra effort during cleaning. With everything taken into consideration, the Keylitos is probably the better choice here.
