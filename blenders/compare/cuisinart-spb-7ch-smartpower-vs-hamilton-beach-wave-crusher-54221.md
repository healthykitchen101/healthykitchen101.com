Both the Cuisinart SmartPower Blender and the Hamilton Beach Wave Crusher are capable of preparing protein shakes, with the Cuisinart yielding a slightly smoother texture, in contrast to the coarser consistency from the Hamilton Beach. However, their ability to handle more challenging ingredients such as frozen items, almonds, and ice is significantly underwhelming, with neither could produce satisfactory results.Â 

The Cuisinart's 500-watt motor somewhat effectively processes fibrous greens, but the outcome is barely adequate. This performance, though not impressive, is notably better than that of the Hamilton Beach. The latter struggles considerably with greens, frequently leaving noticeable, unblended chunks, and consistently failing to achieve a smooth blend.
