In our tests, the Ninja Professional Plus Blender excelled at ice crushing, backed by a sturdy blade and 1400-watt motor. However, its performance was only average when dealing with tougher ingredients like kale, oatmeal, almonds, dried berries, and frozen fruits. This issue is tied to the blender's stacked blade design, which doesn't produce enough upward motion in the liquid, a key factor in creating a strong vortex that ensures all ingredients are evenly drawn into the blades for a consistent blend.

In contrast, the Vitamix 5200 stands out with its ability to handle a diverse range of blending tasks. Its durability, ease of use, and consistent blending quality make it an absolutely more reliable choice over the Ninja Professional Plus. Just make sure you're prepared to invest in its higher price.
