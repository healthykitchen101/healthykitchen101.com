If your blending needs go beyond the basics and you value a no-frill blender, the Oster Pro 1200 is the clear choice over the Black and Decker. 

Equipped with a 1200-watt motor, the Oster Pro handles a wide range of ingredients with relative ease and smoothness, from tough nuts and seeds to fibrous greens and ice cubes. The Black and Decker’s 550-watt motor, on the other hand, struggles with most blending challenges. It performs adequately only with fresh, soft ingredients for basic smoothies or purees.

The user experience also differs notably between the two. The Oster Pro enhances the user experience with its user-friendly interface, including intuitive controls and an additional blending cup for added convenience. In contrast, the Black+Decker Crush Master has been noted for issues like the challenge in removing the lid and the stiffness of its control buttons.
