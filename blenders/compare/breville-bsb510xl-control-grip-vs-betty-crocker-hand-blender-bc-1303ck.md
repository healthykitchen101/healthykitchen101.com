The Breville BSB510XL Control Grip is a high-quality blender set, but it doesn’t pull the stops out against the Betty Crocker. The main issue, in part, seems to be with the blade design. The Breville is excellent for almond milk and whipped egg whites, barely acceptable for hot soup purees, while below standard for frozen fruit smoothies and a failure with mayonnaise. The Betty Crocker failed in our frozen fruit smoothie and it doesn’t have a whisk for egg white. All other blending tasks are acceptable to average. 

At the end of day, you can get more done with the Breville although purees are a bit lumpy and the smoothies take too long so turn mushy. The Breville doesn’t vibrate much, but the strong suction force led to a lot of spills. For the Bettty Crocker, the construction is really poor quality, especially the shaft and the blade showed early signs of rusting. The buttons were stiff and the vortex force poor. At the end of the day, there are better blender sets than this Breville, and better hand blenders than the Betty Corcker.
