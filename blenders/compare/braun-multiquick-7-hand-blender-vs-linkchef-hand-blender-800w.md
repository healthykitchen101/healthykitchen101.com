In our tests, the LINKChef was adequate for pureeing and making nut milk. It also handled tasks like emulsifying mayonnaise and whipping eggs well, thanks to an additional whisk attachment. Still, its ability to process frozen fruits was less convincing. Contrasting sharply with the Braun Multiquick-7, which achieved a silky smooth consistency in just a minute, the LINKChef required three times as long and still produced a mix that was rough and chunky.

Beyond frozen fruit smoothies, the Braun MultiQuick-7 also outperformed the LINKChef in all the other tests. Its advanced blade technology and higher power often give it an edge in both blending time and texture quality.Â 

Regarding design and usability, the LINKChef doesn't compare to the Braun MultiQuick-7, whose higher cost is offset by superior construction, more attractive aesthetics, and numerous user-friendly features.
