The Elite Gourmet, unlike the Bell-10 Speed blender set, doesn’t come with a whisk for whipping egg whites. For other performance markers such as hot soup purees and almond milk, the Elite Gourmet generally outperforms the Bella except that the Elite fails with frozen fruit smoothies. For the Elite Gourmet, hot soup purees are generally smooth in texture, although not silky smooth. Almond milk came out with a creamy texture, but the Bella never achieved this due to a strong suction force interfering with the process.

Since both of these machines are in the budget category, neither have a satisfactory build quality. The Bella utilizes a medium grade plastic which could potentially cause issues with the fitting of the blending shaft. The Elite Gourmet uses  an even lighter-weight and flimsier plastic (also forming the blade guard!). The Elite Gourmet is easy to control having only one speed and two buttons, but its low 150 W draw is not suited to tough tasks which require more stopping and starting. The Bella, meanwhile, has a really high vibrational force, strong suction force, and stiff buttons.
