Both the Keylitos and Utalent are 5-in-1 packages with a hand blender, food processor, whisk, milk frother, and beaker—except that the Keylitos throws in a bottle brush for good measure. Great stuff aside, the Keylitos did prove itself immeasurably better than the Utalent. The Keylitos blended an acceptable average for both hot soup purees and frozen fruit smoothies, while excelling at all other tasks, including almond milk. The Utalent could only whip up a decent mayonnaise while proving  itself, ironically, talentless at everything else. 

It is no surprise, therefore, that the Keylitos had a better build and design, with the Utalent’s blending core looked worryingly flimsy. The Utalent also uses a four instead of two-prong blade design, which proved overall ineffective and it was also a chore to clean. If you are looking for a 5-in-1 blending set, there is no reason not to go with the Keylitos over the Utalent(ess)!
