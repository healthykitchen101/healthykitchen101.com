If itâ€™s a frozen fruit smoothie you are after, neither of the blenders is for you. By a long shot, the both failed dismally at this task and without a whisk, the Elite Gourmet will not get your egg whites done either. The LINKChef, however, is an excellent blender choice for mayonnaise and egg whites, while hot soup purees and almond milk were a little coarse in their texture, but acceptable enough. The only advantage the Elite Gourmet has is its superior ability with hot soup purees, which was hardly enough to edge out the LINKChef as the superior blender here.

The Elite Gourmet is a single blender stick with no accessories. Still, its quality is very questionable with low grade plastic parts for the most and subpar finishing. The LINKChef, on the other hand, is a 5-part blending set with a build quality to match the price. It does have noticeable vibrational force which also creates strong suction. The Elite Gourmet had neither of these but the weak vortex led to continually stopping and starting, which was tiring.
