Despite the difference in motor power,  the Ninja AMZ493BRN and BN701 Professional Plus are closely matched in terms of performance. They both can crush ice with ease yet fall short in liquifying fibrous green and blending frozen fruits. In tasks like making nut butter and preparing protein shakes, they perform reasonably well, though not flawlessly. 

This parallel in performance, however, diverges when considering build quality. We found the BN701's container is prone to scratches, and more notably, its motor began emitting a high-pitched whine, suggestive of wear or internal malfunction, after just a few uses. In contrast, the AMZ493BRN maintains consistent operation throughout extended testing. A wider range of accessories also give it an edge in terms of versatility over the BN701.
