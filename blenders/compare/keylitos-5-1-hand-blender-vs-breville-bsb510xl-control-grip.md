The Keylitos 5-in-1 taking on a big kitchen name like Breville sounds like a dog fight, but the Keylitos managed to stand its ground. Hot soup purees for Keylitos were slightly less lumpy than the Breville, and frozen fruit smoothies for the Breville took a long time and ended up rather watery. Surprisingly, the Breville was marginally better with almond milk, a failure at mayonnaise, while both did excellently with whipped egg whites. Overall, you can get more done, and to greater satisfaction, with the Keylitos than the Breville.

The Breville, however, doesn't disappoint with its superior build quality, and the blending shaft is 1.3 inches and the cord 11 inches longer than the Keylitos. Their design is similar with multiple speeds adjusted by a top-mounted dial. Overall, the Breville is steadier and handles better than the Keylitos, but the Keylitos has a great easy-to-access turbo function. The only usability issue for the Breville was difficulty in cleaning off stuff like mayonnaise easily.
