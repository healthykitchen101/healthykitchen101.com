The Elite Gourmet Immersion Blender and the Betty Crocker Hand Blend are two quite similar in a number of ways. Both are simple blender sticks with no additional accessories, including a whisk, except that the Betty Crocker comes with a blending beaker.Â  Both have a low build quality being mostly constructed out of plastic parts, even the blade guard, and the parts generally have a poor finish. The Betty Crocker, however, has two speeds while the Elite Gourmet; and its shaft is 0.7 inches shorter.

It should be noted that these two blenders are in the budget category and they cannot be expected to perform rigorous blending tasks. Without a whisk, neither can whip up egg whites, and both lack power draw for blending through a frozen fruit smoothie. That said, the Elite Gourmet is the better blender as well as showing slightly better design and material quality. The Elite Gourmet is above average to excellent with hot soup purees and mayonnaise respectively; and its almond milk is pretty good too. For all these tasks, the Betty Crocker is average as the very best.
