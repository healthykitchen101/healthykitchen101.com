Neither the KOIOS 4-In-1 nor the Betty Crocker are particularly good blenders, but there are few good cheap comparisons to be made. For both blenders, hot soup purees and almond milk turn out good enough for an average home cook. The purees tend to be a bit lumpy, and the almond milk is not so silky. Even with a whisk attachment, the KOIS only scored average for whipped egg whites. In terms of performance, the KOIOS is the better choice especially, since the Betty Crocker is not good at making frozen fruit smoothies.Â 

Even for a low-price blender, the Betty Crocker shows poor quality materials and workmanship. The KOIOS has more stainless steel parts, it runs smoothly, and the bonus is 12 speeds and a turbo function. The top-mounted dials are a little easier to use than other similar designs, and the turbo function offers a great short cut. The Betty Crocker, though, is cumbersome to control because it lacks a powerful vortex action, and some nooks in the design make it annoying to get completely clean.
