The Ninja Professional Plus Blender, with its 1400-watt motor and solid blades, showed impressive results in ice crushing during our tests. However, it fell short in blending kale, oatmeal, almonds, dried berries, and frozen fruits. This shortfall is attributed to its stacked blade design, which fails to create an effective upward motion, essential for a thorough and even blend.

Contrastingly, the Vitamix E310 Explorian provided superior capabilities, handling a broad range of ingredients easily and quickly. Its combination of durability, user-friendliness, and consistent blending results positions it as a more reliable choice than the Ninja Professional Plus. While it comes with a higher price tag, the Vitamix 5200's performance and longevity make it a worthy investment for those seeking a top-tier blender.
