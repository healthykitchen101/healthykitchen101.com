The NutriBullet distinguishes itself with its versatility and consistent performance across a variety of tasks. It excels in making smoothies, protein shakes, and crushed ice, while also handling challenging leafy greens and frozen ingredients with ease, thanks to its high rotation speed and 1200W motor. 

Conversely, the Ninja BN701 offers a different approach. Its standout feature is ice crushing. However, it often falls short in processing fibrous or dense ingredients as its stacked blade design does not create an effective vortex. 

In summary, for a blend of efficiency, ease of use, and durability, the NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z comes out as a more recommendable option over the Ninja BN701 Professional Plus.
