The Chefman Vegetable Slicer 6-in-1, despite having all the extras, only excels at making mayonnaise and whipped egg whites; all key blending tasks are basically subpar. The key issue was the longer times it took. Soft vegetable purees came out good enough, while frozen fruit smoothies and almond milk were acceptable with extra blending time. The Elite Gourmet doesn’t have a whisk, but it excels at hot soup purees and mayonnaise, is average with almond milk, and fails to make acceptable frozen fruit smoothies. 

The Elite Gourmet is mostly composed of lower quality plastic parts, including shaft joining and the blade guard, plus it lacks a proper grip. It only has one speed and the low power draw results in a poor vortex force and much stopping and starting during blending. The Chefman has a good build quality to match the price, the controls are responsive, but the suction tends to cause splatter if you move the beaker around. Overall, the Chefman is the much better choice here.
