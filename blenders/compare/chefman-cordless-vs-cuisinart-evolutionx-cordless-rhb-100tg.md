The Chefman Cordless and Cuisinart Evolitionx Cordless are both super convenient and easy to use blenders. There are, however, a couple of determining factors. The Chefman is slightly better at hot soup purees and it powers through frozen smoothies. The Cuisinart, in contrast, is a little on the chunky and slow side with both results. The Chefman doesn’t have a whisk, which is why the Cuisinart is better for mayonnaise, and of course whipping up egg whites.

Although these two cordless blenders are much on par for quality design and good build, the Chefman proved a little easier to handle as well as to disassemble. The battery charge time and life for both machines is basically the same. Apart from specific performance differences, the Cuisinart comes with a whisk and a beaker, while the Chefman doesn’t; but it at least has a blade guard for when not in use.
