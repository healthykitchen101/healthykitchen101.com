On paper, the LINKChef appears to be a jack-of-all-trades, promising to handle a vast array of food preparation tasks. However, our hands-on testing suggests that this blender is only suitable for simple tasks like making mayonnaise and blending fresh, soft ingredients. For more complex preparations such as creating silky smoothies with frozen fruits or finely pureed soups, it often leaves much to be desired in the final product.  

In contrast, the Ninja Foodi Power Mixer System stands out with its exceptional blending capabilities. Its powerful motor and hardened stainless steel blades effortlessly take on tough ingredients, from frozen fruits to fibrous vegetables. Indeed, the LINKChef’s performance is no match, and even subpar, compared to this Ninja. As such, if the budget allows, investing in Ninja Foodi would provide a more comprehensive blending solution.
