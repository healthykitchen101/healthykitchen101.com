Our testing revealed that the BELLA can puree soup with a capability comparable to the Braun Multiquick-7. It even outperformed its competitor in making frozen fruit smoothies and emulsifying mayonnaise, though only by a small margin. When dealing with tasks like making almond milk and whipping egg whites to stiff peaks, however, it somehow faced a significant setback. The Braun MultiQuick-7, on the other hand, appears to be a more impressive all-around performer with outcomes that range from smooth to perfection.

Design-wise, the Braun MultiQuick-7 comes equipped with a premium, top-grade construction which gives it a solid feel and sets it apart in the mid-range category. In contrast, the BELLA 10-Speed’ medium-grade plastic body and delicate inner components could influence its overall structural integrity.

The ease of use also varies significantly between the two, with the Braun providing a user-friendly experience, while the BELLA’s stiff and unresponsive buttons, along with its excessive motor vibration, contribute to a less comfortable blending experience.
