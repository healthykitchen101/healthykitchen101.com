Out of all blenders we have tested so far, the Betty Crocker has one of the poorest build quality assessments. This detracts substantially from its test scores on paper. The Chefman might be slower with hot soup purees and almond milk, but the end results were not that much different between the two blenders. A key issue with the Chefman is slower blending times, but its excellent whisk took no time to make perfect mayonnaise and whipped egg whites. The Betty Crocker, on the other hand, was semi-descent with mayonnaise but its low power draw couldn’t manage a frozen fruit smoothie.

The Betty Crocker is mostly made of low-grade looking plastic; this includes the blending shaft joinings and the blade guard. Like the Chefman, it’s a dual speed blender, but the buttons are stiff and uncomfortable. Also, the low power draw of the Betty Crocker leads to splashing and interruptions during blending. The Chefman, by comparison, has good button traction and runs smoothly. The only usability issue is the strong suction force that leads to splattering if the beaker moves during blending. By a long shot, the Chefman is the better choice here.
