Sporting a 500-watt motor, the Cuisinart produced a smooth protein shake packed with oatmeal, almond, and dried blueberries, with relative ease. However, it was incapable of crushing ice, preparing frozen fruit smoothies, and making spreadable butter. Meanwhile, the Ninja BN701 handled these challenging tasks quite efficiently, though both blenders did struggle with consistently liquifying fibrous greens.

Design-wise, the Ninja comes with a sturdier construction overall. This is especially noticeable in the Cuisinart's blade assembly base, which is made of lower-grade plastic, thus compromising its rigidity and making it prone to deformation under pressure.
