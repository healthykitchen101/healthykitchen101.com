The Betty Crocker comes as a single blending stick with a beaker, but the Bella 10-speed is a blender set that includes a whisk. Therefore, the Betty Crocker doesn’t do whipped egg whites, but it fails at frozen fruit smoothies and is pretty average at everything else. For hot soup purees, the Bella was only slightly better and the opposite was true for almond milk. Although purees are acceptable, the only thing the Bella is excellent at is frozen fruit smoothies and mayonnaise. 

Despite the mixed performance of the Bella, it is still a way better proposition than the Betty Crocker, especially in terms of design quality and ease-of-use. The Bella is reasonably good quality for the price, but the Betty Crocker is mostly made of a cheap type of plastic, including the blending shaft and blade guard! Additionally, the poor vortex force leads to a lot of splattering and the buttons are unresponsive. The Bella also has issues too with its strong vibrational force as well as stiff, unresponsive buttons.
