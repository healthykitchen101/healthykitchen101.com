The Utalent 5-in-1 and the Elite Gourmet and two immersion blenders that may not please you, but in different ways. The Utalent, a 5-piece set that includes a whisk, shows poor performance while the Elite Gourmet has questionable quality. The Utalent only excelled at mayonnaise, and the whisk was average at whipping egg whites. It took a long time to get there and the motor got rather hot in the process. Standard blending tasks like hot soup purees, frozen smoothies, and almond milk were all below par. The Elite Gourmet does better with average to good performance, except that it cannot muster enough power for frozen fruit smoothies.Â 

Both these blenders show somewhat poor construction, especially with joining parts of the blending sticks. The Utalent has a better quality blade construct, but the four-blade design seemed ineffective. Its turbo function, however, was much appreciated whereas the Elite Gourmet has only one, limiting speed. The Utalent is a little more difficult to handle, however, with its strong vibrations and suction force, whereas the Elite Gourmet requires frequent stopping and starting due to the poor vortex force.
