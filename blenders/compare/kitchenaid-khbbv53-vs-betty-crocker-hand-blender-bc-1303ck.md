The Kitchenaid Cordless is a great blender for basics like purees and smoothies. Like the Betty Crocker, it doesn’t come with a whisk which means mayonnaise turns out mediocre and beating egg whites is out of the question. On the other hand, there is not much to say about the Betty Crocker. Soup purees come out a little chunky, but good enough for the budget price, however, it lacked enough power and blade capability to do much for a frozen smoothie.

Neither of these budget blenders look sleek and polished. However, the Betty Crocker has noticeably poor construction, especially the design and quality of the blade. The Chefman Cordless has  a strong suction force and ingredients tend to get stuck now and then. On the other hand, the Betty Crocker has stiff buttons and a rather annoying tendency to splatter due to the poor design of the shaft.
