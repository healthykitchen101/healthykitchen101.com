The Bella 10-Speed and the LINKChef show varying performance results with a  similar build quality for the price. Both are blender sets, but the LINKChef has an extra food processor part and a milk frother, while both sets include a whisk and beaker. A deciding factor between the two may be that the LINKChef is useless at making frozen fruit smoothies. However, it is marginally better at making almond milk and whips the Bella completely with fluffy egg whites. The Bella is better if you need decent hot soup purees and excellent frozen fruit smoothies. 

Both these hand blenders and multi-speed devices using a  top-mounted dial. The Bella has 10 speeds and the LINKChef 20, although these hardly translate in any major performance differences. LINKChef has a two-prong blade and the Bella has four which makes it more difficult to clean.  The LINKChef is also easier to use with more responsive buttons and less vibrational force. The suction force of the Bella can be quite tiring on the arm.
