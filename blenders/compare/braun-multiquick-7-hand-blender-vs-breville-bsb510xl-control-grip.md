Both the Braun Multiquick-7 and Breville BSB510XL Control Grip are premium blenders with a professional aesthetic appeal, solid construction, and user-friendly features. However, the notable difference in power ratings between these two blenders significantly influences their performance disparities.

In our tests, the Braun Multiquick-7 churned out a silky smooth veggies soup in just 30 seconds. It also breezed through frozen fruits and produced a batch of nut milk effortlessly. Due to its weaker 280-watt motor power, the Breville BSB510XL Control Grip appeared mediocre compared to the competitor. While it performed adequately in grinding almonds and beating eggs, it struggled with smoothie-making and lacked the effectiveness of the Braun in pureeing soup. Similarly, the mayonnaise it produced was thinner yet required a longer emulsifying time to achieve.Â 

Considering its better performance and lower price, the Braun MultiQuick-7 seems to be a more valuable choice.
