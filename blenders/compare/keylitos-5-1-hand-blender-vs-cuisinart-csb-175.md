The Keylitos 5-in-1 Hand Blender and the Cuisinart Smart Stick are equally matched for standard blending tasks. For hot soup purees, the Keylitos was noticeably a notch smoother than the Cuisinart. For frozen fruit smoothies, the Cusinart came out tops mainly because it did the job faster, and both did equally well to produce consistently smooth almond milk. A key difference, however, is that the Keylitos is a blender set with an included whisk, whereas the Cuisinart is just a blender stick with no other accessories except a beaker.

Looking up close, we felt the Cuisinart showed an overall better build quality, including the blade. However, it only has two speeds while the Keyltios has 12, but for most tasks two speeds worked fine. In terms of ease-of use, the Keylitos produced less problematic vibration and suction force and the blades were easier to clean. Considering the extras you get, including a milk frother, the Keylitos may just be the better deal for some.
