Both these blenders come with a lot of packaged stuff, so the immersion blender stick is only part of the deal. The Keylitos has a food processor, whisk, beaker, and a milk frother. The Chefman is a multi-food processor with a whisk. Despite whatever stuff you prefer, the Keylitos is the hands down winner in all blender performance tests. Admittedly, the Chefman does better at whipped egg white, but that’s about all. For the Keylitos, shot soup purees and frozen fruit smoothies are average to good, while all other blending tasks were good bordering on excellent. 

The build quality, weight, and length of these two immersion blenders is much the same. However, the Keylitos gives you 12 speed selections, while the Chefman only has two. The user experience of both blenders is also very similar. There is a little vortex action to deal with, and the Keylitos can be cumbersome with its top-mounted controls, but its turbo function is easy to access and works like a dream. Due to its better blade design and power settings, the Keylitos comes out tops.
