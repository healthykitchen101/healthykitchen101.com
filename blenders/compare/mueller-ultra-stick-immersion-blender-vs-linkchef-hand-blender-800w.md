The LINKChef put up quite a challenge against the Mueller Ultra Stick in all tasks except for frozen fruit smoothies. For some reason, probably due to the blade design, the LINKChef was unable to make anything that resembled a proper smoothie. Hot soup purees were a little chunkier than the Mueller, but acceptable enough. Both blenders were on par for making almond milk. The LINKChef, however, excels with its more bulbous-shaped whisk, doing an almost perfect job with mayonnaise and whipped egg whites. The Mueller was good with the former and only acceptable with the latter. 

Key design differences are that in addition to a whisk and a milk frother, the LINCKChef also has a blending beaker and a food processor, their build quality being  average or basically good for the price. Handling-wise, the Mueller lacks a good vortex force, meaning you have to move the stick around alot. The buttons are also clicky and uncomfortable to touch. The LINKChef, on the other hand, vibrates excessively,  which is also a discomfort. Ultimately, if you are not interested in the food processor extension, the Mueller is probably the better bet.
