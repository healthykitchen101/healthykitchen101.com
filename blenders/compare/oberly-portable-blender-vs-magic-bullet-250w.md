At a glance, the Magic Bullet might seem to promise a slightly superior blending capacity, but when pitted against the rigors of everyday blending, its edge over the OBERLY becomes surprisingly marginal.

Both blenders are fairly capable of processing fresh fruits, soaked nuts, or cooked veggies. Yet, they falter when dealing with fibrous ingredients, ice, and frozen fruits. Their motors and blades simply aren't cut out for these heavy-duty operations. As such, if high-performance blending is your top priority, neither blender might meet your expectations.

Nevertheless, for those torn between the Magic Bullet and the OBERLY, there's more at play than blending prowess. The OBERLY stands out for its portability, a key feature for those on-the-go, making it an enticing choice for frequent travelers or those with active lifestyles.
