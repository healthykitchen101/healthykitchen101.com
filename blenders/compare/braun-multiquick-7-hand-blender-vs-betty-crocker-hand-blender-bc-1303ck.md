Considering the overall quality, performance, and versatility, the Braun MQ7035X is a definitive recommendation for anyone seeking a reliable, high-performing immersion blender. In our test, it surpassed the Betty Crocker in nearly every aspect, from its powerful motor and innovative blade technology to its sturdy construction and user-friendly design. Out of five tests, it achieved above-average results in all, with speed and finesse that many other models, including the Betty Crocker, couldn’t match.

Operating on a lower-powered 200-watt motor, the Betty Crocker managed simple  tasks like soup pureeing adequately, but its performance noticeably wanes with more demanding jobs like processing frozen fruits and raw nuts. Its blending wand also lacks the efficiency of the Braun’s whisk attachment, especially when it comes to making mayonnaise and whipping egg whites.
