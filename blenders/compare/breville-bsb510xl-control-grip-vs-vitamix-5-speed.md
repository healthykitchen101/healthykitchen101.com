While costing the same as the Vitamix 5-Speed, the Breville BSB510XL Control Grip is entirely incomparable in terms of performance due to its lower-powered motor.

Whether you’re blending for a crowd or with lots of tough ingredients, the Vitamix 5-Speed Makes it easy with its mighty strength (625-watt) and super-sharp blades. Sporting a 280-watt motor, the Breville BSB510XL Control Grip is okay for simpler tasks, but not a good option if you’re after heavy blending performance. 

Sharing an array of technology features, these two immersion blenders are closely matched in terms of usability, but overall we give the Breville BSB510XL a slight edge since it’s a bit more comfortable to use in a long blending duration.
