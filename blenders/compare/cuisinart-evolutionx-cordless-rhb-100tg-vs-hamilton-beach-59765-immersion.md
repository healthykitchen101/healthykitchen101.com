A Cuisinart versus a Hamilton Beach sounds like a showdown between a couple of big guns. Surprisingly, however, this Hamilton Beach 2-Speed fails to deliver in terms of performance, design, as well as usability. The Hamilton Beach comes with a whisk and a food processor, but it appears to be somewhat of a ‘compact blender’ with a stubby body and rather short blending shaft—it’s a whole 1.4 inches shorter than the Cuisinart. Performance wise, the Hamilton only excelled with hot soup purees, so it is really just a one-shot-wonder blender. The blade design is not suited to blending almond milk and the whisk did a poor job with egg whites and it was dismal with mayonnaise. 

The build quality of the Hamilton Beach is also very questionable. Plastic and connective parts of the blending shaft are poor quality and appear easily breakable. The outside of the motor body also discolors easily and the machine tends to get rather hot, suggesting an overheating problem. In addition, the buttons are unresponsive and the machine vibrates and moves excessively when in use. The Cuisinart has none of these issues, it is a quality and well-built machine, easy to use with little suction force, and it provides an all round satisfying experience. It is just not the best blender in terms of purees and smoothies, especially with the time it takes, but the final results are good enough for basic home needs.
