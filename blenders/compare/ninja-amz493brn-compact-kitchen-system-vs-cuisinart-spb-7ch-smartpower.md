Both the Cuisinart SPB-7CH SmartPower and the Ninja AMZ493BRN bring their unique qualities to the table, but it's the Ninja that takes a slight lead.Â 

Equipped with a 500-watt motor, the Cuisinart performs adequately in making protein shakes but struggles with more demanding processes such as blending leafy greens or crushing ice.

The Ninja AMZ493BRN, boasting a more robust 1200-watt motor, offers a moderate improvement over the Cuisinart. This enhanced power enables it to handle a wider range of ingredients more effectively than the Cuisinart, though its overall performance remains average and is not without shortcomings.

Design and build quality also distinguish these two models. The Cuisinart, prone to scratches and made with lower-grade materials, contrasts with the Ninja's more robust construction.
