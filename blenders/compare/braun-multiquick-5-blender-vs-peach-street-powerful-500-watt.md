The Peach Street is no match for the Braun Multiquick which outperforms the Peach in all categories. Two blenders weigh almost the same, and the Peach Street’s longer shaft seems to offer no true advantage. While the Braun will take you seamlessly through any task, the main issue with the Peach is its tendency to create a strong suction making it difficult to maneuver.  On the positive side, the Peach did well with pureeing soup and making almond milk, was mediocre with mayonnaise and smoothies, but dismal at whipping egg whites. 

All considered, the Peach is a budget option. Its motor is housed in a medium quality plastic hold and the look is not as polished as the Braun. Both blenders have their weak points in terms of ease of use. The buttons on the Braun are quite stiff and require some strain and stress. The Peach, however, is often unresponsive so your fingers get fatigues and the shaft is not so easy to control. Both are easy to assemble and take apart, but with the Peach we had to struggle a little more with cleaning tough substances.
