In terms of performance, the Elite Gourmet EHB 2425X is a great blender for hot soup purees, mayonnaise, and reasonable for almond milk. It fails with making frozen fruit smoothies, and doesnâ€™t have a whisk for whipping egg whites. The Mueller ultra-Stick, which includes a whisk and a milk frother, will do a lot more for and its performance metrics are average to quite acceptable across the board. Ultimately, the Mueller has decent performance, but the user experience is not that great.

For the Mueller, the buttons are clicky and uncomfortable and the strong vibration makes handling tiring after a while. The Elite Gourmet, with its low 150 W power draw, fails to get things going easily, especially frozen smoothies, and the lack of vortex results in splashes and repeatedly stopping and starting during operations. The Elite Gourmet is flimsy and made entirely out of plastic, the blades lack firmness and sharpness, the shaft is a fall inch shorter than the Mueller.
