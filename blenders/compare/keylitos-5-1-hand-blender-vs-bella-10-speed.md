The Keylitos 5-in-1, like the Bella 10-Speed, is a blender set with various accessories. Compared to the Keylitos, the Bells only had the edge with (pretty excellent) frozen fruit smoothies. Hot soup purees were on par with the Keylitos, meaning a little lumpy but not really smooth enough. The Keylitos excelled with whipped egg whites and almond milk, while Bellaâ€™s poor quality whisk failed with egg whites and its strong suction force resulted in a poor performance with almond milk.

The relative build quality of the machines is much the same and both have somewhat cumbersome top-mounted controls. One key difference is the Keylitos has two arms on the blade while the Bella uses four, a design typically not the best for almond or nut milks. Furthermore, while the Keylitos is responsive and easy enough to handle, while the Bella has stiff and somewhat slippery buttons plus a strong suction force that taxes the hand during blending.
