The Cuisinart Smart Stick comes as a simple blender stick with a beaker, but no whisk. Despite not having a whisk for whipping egg whites, it excels at making mayonnaise even pipping the LINKChef Hand Blender to the post. The Cuisinart actually out-blends the LINKChef in all tasks, while the LINKChef is dismal at frozen fruit smoothies and only mediocre at almond milk and hot soup purees.Â 

No surprisingly, the Cuisinart shows superior build quality and design fundamentals. Despite this, the Cuisinart does have fundamental ease-of-use issues. The safety mechanism and the button locations make easy access during blender cumbersome. There is also a significant suction force and food often gets stuck between the blades. For the LINKChef, the buttons are somewhat stiff and the shaft is prone to heavy vibrating. All in all, there are better blenders to choose from.
