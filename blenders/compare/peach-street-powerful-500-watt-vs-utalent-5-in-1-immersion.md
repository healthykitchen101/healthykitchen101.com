The Peach Street Powerful is a no-fuss blender which doesn’t include a whisk. The UTALENT 5-in-1 seemingly has it all, except good performance to match. The only thing it can really do is make good mayonnaise and egg whites took their time to stiffen up. Other key blending tasks were well below par, while for the Peach Street hot soup purees and almond milk were excellent, frozen fruit smoothies and mayonnaise average to good; therefore making it a good and reasonable all-rounder. 

The UTALENT is problematic in that the materials are mostly lower quality plastic and connective parts, especially in the shaft core, lack durability.  The Peach Street may not have a high-end looking finish, but the build quality is quite acceptable and good for the price. Both blenders often produced violent vibrations, but the UTALENT was a little easier to handle, especially with its more responsive buttons. There was, however, little observable difference in the UTALENT speed levels and we resorted to mostly using the turbo function.
