The All-Clad comes equipped with a higher-powered motor compared to the Braun Multiquick-7. Still, it is unable to make mayonnaise and delivers only average results in puréeing soup. In tasks like preparing frozen fruit smoothies, grinding almond milk, and whipping egg whites, it’s also outperformed by the Braun Multiquick-7, which not only blends faster but also produces finer and more uniform outcomes. 

Usability-wise, the All-Clad is somewhat difficult to maneuver particularly when changing speeds, due to excessive suction to the beaker. This, combined with the motor uneven acceleration, often results in hand fatigue and challenging blending motions during the blending process. 

Conversely, the Braun Multiquick-7 impressed with its efficient vortex effect, which smoothly draws ingredients into the blades for consistent blending. Its bell-shaped blade guard effectively minimizes splashes and reduces suction for better control. The Braun Multiquick-7 is also designed for gradual acceleration, counteracting the abrupt and high-torque start-up common in other blenders, including the All-Clad.
