The Betty Crocker is, overall, no match for the Cuisinart Evolutionx Cordless, although it does do a slightly better job at blending hot soup purees. The Cuisinart leaves a noticeable amount of chunkiness behind in soups, is very average for frozen fruit smoothies, but does a surprisingly good job with almond milk. The Betty Crocker fails to get things going easily with frozen fruit smoothies and it doesn’t have a whisk attachment like the Cuisinart, so it is no good really for mayonnaise and whipped egg whites.

The Betty Crocker has rather sub-standard build quality overall, a somewhat shortish shaft, and the controls are rigid and tiring to use. The Cuisinart is a pleasure to use, with a good natural contour, and responsive controls.  In short, the Betty Crocker is not really ideal for any task and lacks overall quality. The Cuisinart does excellently with whipped egg whites, almond milk, and mayonnaise while just being average for hot soup purees and frozen fruit smoothies.
