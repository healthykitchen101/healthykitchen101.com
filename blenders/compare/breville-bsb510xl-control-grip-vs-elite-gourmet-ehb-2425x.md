The Breville SBS510XL Control Grip and the Elite Gourmet Immersion Blender are a great match for mediocre blenders. The Breville, at least, makes up for its lack-luster performance with excellent quality and ease-of-use (and a price tag).  The Elite Gourmet comes as just a blender stick and it is only really good for making mayonnaise and hot soup purees. The Breville is a blender set with a good processor, a whisk, and a beaker. It’s an excellent blender for almond milk and whipped egg whites, but not much more than that.

If you need the extras, the Breville may be worth it for its excellent build quality and smooth operation. However, there are better blender sets to choose from. The Elite Gourmet, on the other hand, is mostly made of a cheap plastic, and the quality is questionable. Its low power draw of 150 W isn’t able to get a good vortex force going, so there is a lot of splatter and stopping and starting during the blending process.
