The Oster Pro comes equipped with a 1200-watt motor. Despite its struggles with frozen fruits in our test, this blender is a worthy consideration for those seeking a blend of performance and affordability, given its adequate ability to crush ice, create almond butter, and liquify fibrous green.

With a lower-powered 700-watt motor, the Hamilton Beach Wave Crusher seems to lag in performance and proves to be sufficient for only basic tasks. Its build quality and usability also leave much to be desired. You might find yourself often grappling with an unintuitive control panel and a stubbornly tight lid, which can make the blending process less smooth and more cumbersome.
