The Braun MultiQuick-5 is a well-rounded immersion blender that excels at a wide range of tasks. It is designed simply and sports a mid-range motor but was still powerful enough to pass all of our tests. We don't have many complaints about this blender, apart from its relatively stiff buttons. For our money, the Braun MultiQuick-5 is the best of the bunch.

The All-Clad’s materials are top-notch, but there isn’t much in return for its efficiency. In our hands-on testing, this blender came behind the competitor in every aspect of its performance despite the higher-powered motor. It wasn’t even able to whip egg white or make mayonnaise. For the most part, we agree this blender offers a less compelling value than the Braun MultiQuick-5, especially considering its premium price.
