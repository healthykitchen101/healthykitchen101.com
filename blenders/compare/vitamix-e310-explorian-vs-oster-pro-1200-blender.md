The choice between the Oster Pro 1200W and the Vitamix E310 Explorian hinges largely on your budget. 

The Oster Pro is a fine match for those who are budget-conscious yet still seek efficient blending capabilities. It shines in simple, basic tasks like crushing ice, preparing green smoothies, and making almond butter but finds its limits with tougher blends like frozen fruits. 

Conversely, the Vitamix E310 Explorian sits in the higher-end bracket, offering outstanding performance across a broader range of tasks, including those that challenge the Oster Pro. Its superior blending abilities, coupled with a lengthy 7-year warranty, make it a worthy investment for those who rely heavily on a blender for diverse culinary tasks.
