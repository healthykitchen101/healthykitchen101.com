While both the Black and Decker 10-Speed Blender and the Cuisinart SmartPower are categorized as mid-range and neither delivers outstanding performance, the Black+Decker performed more efficiently in blending frozen fruits, processing almond butter, and liquifying fibrous greens. Crushing ice is a weak point for both due to their limited power and inadequate blade’s design.

Design and build quality reflect their pricing tier, with neither blender can boast the durability, sturdiness, or aesthetic appeal that one might find in premium, higher-priced models. Usability-wise, the Black+Decker’s performance is slightly marred by its emission of a plastic odor during operation, while the Cuisinart faces issues with its  rigid controls and a lid that is difficult to remove.
