Neither the Peach Street Powerful nor the Elite Gourmet immersion blenders come with accessories, including a whisk. The Elite Gourmet, however, still does a stellar job with making mayonnaise, but the Peach Street is better at all other tasks. The Peach Street is above average to good across the board, but the Elite Gourmet couldnâ€™t muster enough power to manage frozen fruit smoothies. In terms of performance, the Peach Street is the easy choice.

The Peach Street is also the better choice for build quality. The Elite Gourmet is mostly made of plastic, including the blade shaft, and it is also 1.3 inches shorter than the Peach Street. It also has only one speed whereas the Peach Street has two. The Peach Street may be a little more challenging to handle with its high vibrational and suction force, but the Elite Gourmet has a weak vortex force which requires continual stopping and starting for tougher textured food. Overall, the Peach Street is still the better deal.
