Both the Hamilton Beach 2 Speed and LINCKChef Hand Blender are blender sets. The Hamilton comes with a whisk and a food processor, the LINKChef an additional beaker and milk frother. Both blenders have performance anomalies. The LINKChef just could do a frozen fruit smoothie, and the Hamilton was a flop at mayonnaise. The Hamilton was subpar with frozen fruit smoothies, so if this is what you need, neither of these blenders are for you.Â  The LINKChef is by far the better blender for almond milk, and the Hamilton for hot soup puree. The LINKChef also has a superior whisk that does excellent mayonnaise and whipped egg whites. Based on performance, the LINKChef is the better choice.

Although more affordable, for a Hamilton Beach, this blender cuts corners with quality, especially the weak joining parts. With the LINKChef, you get good quality and value for the price. The LINKChef is also 1.3 inches longer on the shaft. The LINKChef has 20 speeds and the buttons were very comfortable; the Hamilton has 2 speeds and the buttons are uncomfortably stiff and unresponsive. This really just affirms that the LINKChef is the better blender.
