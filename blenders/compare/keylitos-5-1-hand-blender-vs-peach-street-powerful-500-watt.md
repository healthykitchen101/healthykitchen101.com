The Keylitos 5-in-1 comes asÂ  a blender and food processor set, whereas the Peach Street Powerful stands alone as a blender stick, with no whisk included. The Peach Street proved an excellent match for the Keylitos is making frozen fruit smoothies and almond milk. It even topped out the Keylitos for hot soup purees, but was a poor show for mayonnaise and had no whisk to beat the egg whites. Performance wise, the Peach Street is not a bad choice, but the Keylitos comes with more and is also way easier to use.

These two blenders are also neck-to-neck in terms of good build quality and external design. The Peach Street is a two speed blender though, and the Keylitos has 12 speeds and a super-convenient turbo function. Where the scales did tip, was good engineering. The Keylitos handles much better, is responsive, with not too much vibrational force or suction. The Peach Street had stiff, unresponsive buttons, often shook violently, and soon tired the arm out.
