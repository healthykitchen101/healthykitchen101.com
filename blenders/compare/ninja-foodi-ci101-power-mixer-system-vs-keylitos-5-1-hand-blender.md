In our tests, the Ninja CI101 produced silky smooth pureed soups. As a heavy blending performance, the Ninja CI101 also breezed through other ingredients, particularly frozen fruits, raw nuts, and fibrous greens, without much struggle. The Keylitos was similarly up to all of the tests. However, its results mostly lacked the refinement and efficiency of the Ninja CI101. Additionally, although the Keylitos comes with practical accessories like a chopper and milk frother, these do not match up to the superior quality and performance offered by the Ninja CI101's attachments.

Design-wise, the Ninja CI101 features a luxurious mix of high-quality materials, which offers a solid feel but also adding heft. In contrast, the Keylitos comes with a mid-grade build quality so it is lighter and quite more manageable. Usability also differs; the Ninja CI101, despite being heavier, scores higher due to its user-friendly features and ease of handling, while the Keylitos struggles with issues like strong suction and inefficient spatter control.Â 

Overall, the Ninja CI101 is suited for those seeking high performance and versatility in a blender. The Keylitos, meanwhile, is more appropriate for basic kitchen tasks and users who prioritize simplicity, even if it means compromising on ergonomics and durability.
