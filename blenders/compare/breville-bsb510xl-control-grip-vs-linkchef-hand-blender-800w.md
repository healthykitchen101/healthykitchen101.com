The Breville BSB510XL and the LINKChef 800W are both blender sets, each with a food processor, a whisk, and a beaker; but the LINCKChef has a milk frother. While neither blender showed overall great performance, the Breville came out the better bet, especially in terms of build quality. Both are mediocre but good enough for home cooked soup purees, and the Breville does well with almond milk and whipped egg whites. The LINKChef, fails completely at frozen fruit smoothies, but fairs acceptably well for other blending tasks.Â 

As can be expected for its brand reputation, the Breville scores higher in build quality than the LINKChef, but the LINKChef still offers excellent quality for lower price. The Breville can be noted for its smooth operation, while the LINKChef does vibrate quite strongly. On the other hand though, the LINKChef has a tighter fitting assembly, and it is easier to clean because things like mayonnaise tend to be difficult to remove from the Breville. Overall, the LINKChef seems the better blender to go for here, unless you love your frozen smoothies.
