The All Clad Corded and the Elite Gourmet Immersion Blender are two simple hand blenders with no accessories, including a whisk. The All Clad is a good blender for frozen fruit smoothies and almond milk. The Elite Gourmet, by contrast, does well with hot soup purees and especially mayonnaise despite not using a whisk. Its almond milk passes as good enough, but the Elite Gourmet cannot make an acceptable frozen fruit smoothie. The All Clad is below average for soup purees and a flop at mayonnaise. In total, you can get more done with the Elite Gourmet, except for frozen fruit smoothies.

Although no clear choice emerges here, the All Clad has an excellent and above expected build  quality. The Elite Gourmet, however, is mostly made of a lightweight and cheap-looking plastic, including the blade guard.  Despite its good build quality, the All Clad has a strong suction force and the unevenness of the acceleration leads to fatigue. The Elite Gourmet, although smooth to operate, lacks proper vortex force. Neither blender is ideal, but ultimately, the choice depends on what you need to blend.
