The Elite Gourmet is a good blender for purees, a loser for making frozen smoothies, and somewhat average with almond milk. The Chefman Cordless does much better all round, except that its purees come out a little lumpy at times. Neither of these machines come with a whisk.

A key design consideration is the the Elite Gourmet has a much shorter shaft, and it is considerably lighter. The Chefman has a much better build quality and look. The Elite Gourmet is mostly made of plastic and the blade has a flimsy appearance and feel to it. The main issue with the Elite Gourmet is that it lacks power and needs better speed adjustments. The Chefman, however, is super easy to handle with its pressure sensitive speed controller.  The Chefman has a much better grip than the Elite Gourmet and it’s easier to assemble.
