The Elite Gourmet proved to have little advantage over the KOIOS 4-In-1 other than making slightly more smooth and less lumpy hot soup purees. A key difference is that the KOIOS is average to good with frozen fruit smoothies, with both score average for almond milk. The milk is good enough for home use, meaning a little gritty and not ultra smooth. Unlike the Elite Gourmet, the KOIOS actually has a whisk, but its performance with whipped egg whites is mediocre. The KOIOS has acceptable design quality for the price, but the overall build quality, and especially that of the blending shaft, are sub-standard on the Elite Gourmet. The Elite Gourmet may be light, but it is largely made of plastic and the blending shaft is rather short. Additionally, its low power draw makes blending and stop-and-start chore and the lack of draw appear. The KOIOS, on the other hand, is very responsive with minimal splashing, noise, or excessive suction force.
