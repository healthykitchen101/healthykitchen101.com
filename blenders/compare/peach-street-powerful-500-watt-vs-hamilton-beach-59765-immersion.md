The Hamilton Beach Powerful 500 W includes a whisk and a food processor, but it still couldnâ€™t whip up a storm against the Peach Street Powerful. The Peach Street, even without a whisk, could whip up decent mayonnaise. Hot soup puree scores were equally good for both blenders, but the Peach Street proved itself far superior at frozen fruit smoothies and almond milk, for which the Hamilton was slow as well as below standard.

The Hamilton is the smaller blender by at least 1.2 inches and the blades are shorter too, perhaps why blending results were not that great. The Peach Street had good build quality for the price, but the Hamilton seemed a bit on the cheap side. Also, the buttons are very stiff and cumbersome, especially for the turbo function. The Peach Street is also a two speed blender; its buttons were a little stiff but not too bad. A key issue with Hamilton is how hot it gets, also coupled to longer blending times. With the Peach Street, you have to grapple somewhat with a strong vibration and suction force. All said and done, the Peach Street is the better choice.
