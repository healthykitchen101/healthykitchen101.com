Breville might be a formidable name in kitchenware, but this BSB510XL put up a dismal show. On the other hand, the Peach Street Powerful is an average to good all-round blender, especially for hot soup purees and almond milk. Even though the Peach Street doesn’t have whisk, it still whipped the Breville in overall performance scores. The Breville was below standard for purees and frozen fruit smoothies, a flop with mayonnaise, but at least shone through with almond milk and mayonnaise. 

You might not be getting a lot done with this Breville, but at least you will be getting superior build and material quality (obviously lacking in good design). The Peach Street has excellent quality for the price, including the blade. The issue with the Breville, as far as we understood, was the ill-thought out design of the blade guard. At least for what the Breville can do, it does it with ease and grace. For the Peach Street, the buttons are a bit stiff and the strong vibrational force may tire out your arm, but if you're blending frozen fruit smoothies for the gym, you should do fine!
