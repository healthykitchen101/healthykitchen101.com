Neither the KOIS 4-In-1 nor the LINKChef are particularly good blenders. Both blenders do a good job with mayonnaise, but the KOIOS is better at soup purees and frozen fruit smoothies. Although not the smoothest texture, the KOIOS is less lumpy than the LINKChef. The latter fails to whip up enough power, despite its name. To blend a frozen smoothie easily. The KOIOS is good enough and both do an average job with almond milk. The LINKChef only excels with mayonnaise and whipped egg white.

Both these blenders come as a set with a food processor, a whisk, and a beaker, but the LINKChef has the addition of a milk frother. Quality wise, the LINKChef is good value for the price you pay and its shaft is longer than most, so it is good for deep pots. However, the KOIOS is easier to handle with little suction and vibration, while the LINKChef is difficult to maneuver at times. Although it has 20 speeds compared to 12 of the KOIOS, the buttons are often unresponsive and the top-mounted dial is not the most convenient. We found the turbo function on the KOIOS to be particularly useful.
