The only good thing about the LINKChef is its excellent whisk. The Keylitos 5-in-1, to its credit, did match the LINKChef in all whisking tasks, and proved itself even better at making mayonnaise. For hot soup purees and frozen fruit smoothies, the Keylitos is good enough for basic home cooking. Purees were not as smooth with some rough textures for hard vegetables; smoothies came out good enough but took twice the time. The LINKChef was a little lumpy with purees, useless at frozen fruit smoothies, and only just acceptable with almond milk.Â 

The LINKChef also comes as a 5-in-1 set which includes, like the Keylitos, a milk frother. Their build quality is similarly good for the price, and both have a top-mounted speed dial. The LINKChef impresses with its 20 speeds, but this doesn't seem to offer any advantage. Both blenders have a relatively noticeable vibration and suction force, but for the Keylitos it was not as pronounced and it therefore proved easier to handle.
