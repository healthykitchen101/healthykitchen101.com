The Ninja CI101 Foodi offers an advanced blending solution, featuring cutting-edge technology that enhances user interaction and efficiency. Its 750-watt motor and well-designed stainless steel blades cater to a wide array of blending tasks with remarkable finesse.

Conversely, the UTALENT 5-in-1 adopts a more traditional approach to blending, focusing on simplicity and standard tasks. However, it performed only mediocrely in our tests. The 250-watt motor struggles with tasks such as processing frozen fruits, leafy greens, or raw nuts, often facing difficulty in these challenges.

Both blenders come with practical accessories, enabling them to make mayonnaise or create stiff peaks from egg whites. Nonetheless, the Ninja's attachments edge out those of the UTALENT in terms of both efficiency and durability.
