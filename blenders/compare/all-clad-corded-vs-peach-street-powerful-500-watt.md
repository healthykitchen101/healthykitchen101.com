The All Clad Corded and the Peach Street Powerful are two simple blender sticks that come with no additional attachments, including a whisk. The Peach Street is an all-round satisfactory blender, only really excelling with hot soup purees and almond milk. For the All Clad, performance is rather mixed; its above average to pretty good with almond milk and smoothies, but below par with hot soup purees. 

Despite its mixed performance, the All Clad has excellent build quality and its shart is almost 1.5 inches longer. This might sweeten the deal, but the blender motor seemed to accelerate unevenly and lacked efficient power delivery.  This didn’t seem to matter much with smoothies and almond milk, but it splashed a lot with purees and mayonnaise just didn’t work at all. The issue with the Peach Street is its clicky and uncomfortable buttons as well as a strong suction force. If you’re not a soupy puree kind of person and prefer a blender for super healthy smoothies and nut milks, the All Clad is not a bad deal.
