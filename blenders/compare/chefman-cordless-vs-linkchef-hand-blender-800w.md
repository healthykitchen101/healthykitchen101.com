The LINKChef Hand is one of the few blenders that failed in our frozen smoothie test. Soup purees came out kind of chunky, but good enough for home cooking or making baby foods, while almond milk was similar . With an included Whisk attachment, the LINKChef at least exceled with mayonnaise and whipped egg whites. On the other hand, the Chefman Cordless does a pretty good job all round, even for mayonnaise, despite not having an included whisk.  Hot soup purees, however, lacked a little in smoothness. 

Both machines have a similar build quality and decent materials for the price, but the Chefman has an overall better look and finish. While the LINKChef impresses with its 20 speed levels, it is cumbersome to control the top-mounted dial. The Chefman can be praised for its super-easy pressure controls, but it doesn’t have a pulse function.
