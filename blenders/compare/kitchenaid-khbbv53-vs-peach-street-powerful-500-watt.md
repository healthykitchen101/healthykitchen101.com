The KitchenAid Cordless is a good all round blender, noteworthy for its cordless convenience, and especially good at making frozen smoothies. The Peach Street isnâ€™t a match for frozen smoothies, but it does okay and blends hot purees and makes almond milk just as well as the KitchenAid. Neither of these two blender come with a whisk attachment, so whipping egg whites is out of the question and mayonnaise is not the best.

The Peach Street is considerably lighter, but it lacks the polished finish and perceived quality of the KitchenAid. A key usability issue with the Peach Street is that it tend to vibrate excessively and move around the container, and this leads to inconsistent blending results. For the KitchenAid, taking the blender apart and assembly after cleaning is not as easy and straightforward as one would think. Overall, the KitchenAid is the better blender, but both do have their unique usability issues.
