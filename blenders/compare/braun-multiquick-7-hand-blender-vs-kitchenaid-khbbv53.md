Both the Braun Multiquick-7 and the KitchenAid Cordless produced impressive results in our tests of pur√©eing soups, blending frozen fruits smoothies, emulsifying mayonnaise, and making almond milk. However, when it came to whisking functions like achieving stiff peaks, the Braun took the lead thanks to its included whisk attachment, offering versatility that the KitchenAid lacks with its more basic accessory set.

Nevertheless, choosing between these two blenders is more about personal preferences than functionality alone. The KitchenAid's cordless design offers unmatched mobility, making it an ideal choice for outdoor cooking activities such as camping or barbecuing. This portability is particularly beneficial for those who value the convenience of blending without the constraint of a power outlet.

Meanwhile, the Braun Multiquick-7 is ideally suited for traditional kitchen environments. Its comprehensive set of attachments, allowing for a wider range of recipes, also adds to its appeal.
