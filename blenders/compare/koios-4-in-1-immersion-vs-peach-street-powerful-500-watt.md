Compared to the KOIOS, the Peach Street Powerful only lives true to its name when making soup purees or almond milk. The texture is generally quite smooth with no lumpiness, whereas the KOIS has a fair bit of lumpiness to purees and grittiness to almond milk. For frozen fruit smoothies, the KOIOS is acceptable to good, but for some reason the Peach Street Powerful cannot muster enough of that power to do smoothies seamlessly and in good time. However, even with a whisk the KOIOS is not that great with whipping egg whites, which is something the whiskless Peach Street cannot do.

The KOIOS has only a slightly better build quality, perhaps reflected in the fact the PEach Street is considerably lighter. The KOIOS, however, wins the day with its ease of use, low vibration level, and minimal suction. The Peach Street buttons are stiff, causing finger fatigue, and the suction and vibration make blending a bit of a chore. There is very little reason to choose the Peach Street over the KOIOS, unless you feel that little edge-over with purees and almond milk is actually worth it.
