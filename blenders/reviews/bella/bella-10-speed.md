Overall Verdict
---------------

Overall Score: **7.1**

*   Performance (50%) - **7.4**/10
    
*   Design (20%) - **7.5**/10
    
*   Usability (30%) - **6.3**/10
    

The BELLA immersion blender brings the efficiency and capability that we expect from a low-range immersion blender, but it is without the comfort that some buyers may be longing for. At the highest speed settings, the motor vibrated quite excessively, causing our hands to feel shaky. The blender’s refinement is also impaired by the hard buttons and uncomfortable-to-use speed dial. These issues, however, are acceptable compromises, given the blender’s small price tag and consistent performance.

**Things We Like**

*   It features multiple speeds. 
*   Extra attachments are included for greater versatility. 
*   Blending wand is easy to remove and attach.

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Its performance is inconsistent.
*   The control buttons are hard to press.
*   The blade guard can cause damage to cookware surfaces.  
*   The motor vibrates violently, making it very difficult to maneuver the blender.

On paper, this BELLA is designed to make your kitchen work simpler. However, our years of testing have taught us that a [low-priced immersion blender](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/immersion-blenders/) may yield short-term savings but will be a headache in the long term. Such a machine often comes with weaker power ratings, limited capabilities, and inconsistent performance compared to [premium blenders](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/). But we wanted to make our own determination about the BELLA 10-speed hand blender so we bought one of our own accord and tested it against a number of other hand blenders.

Performance: Competitive Overall Efficiency
-------------------------------------------

performance Scores: **7.4**

*   Hot Soup Purée (35%) - **7.5**/10
    
*   Frozen Fruit Smoothie (30%) - **9.3**/10
    
*   Mayonnaise (15%) - **9.0**/10
    
*   Almond Milk (5%) - **6.0**/10
    
*   Whipped Egg-Whites (5%) - **6.0**/10
    

The BELLA wasn’t the perfect immersion blender in any test but it turned out to be a surprise bargain, delivering results that were satisfying enough. The Inclusion of a whisk attachment also means it is one of the most capable models we’ve tried.

### Hot Soup Purée

" width="300px" height="200px">

Pureeing Time: 30 seconds

Result: Chunky

Suction: Tightly

The BELLA is moderately capable at pureeing soup. In our test, it took around 30 seconds to blend and combine all the ingredients. However, we still found lots of tiny chunks when we ran the soup through a strainer. On the whole, blending didn’t go smoothly since the blender itself created a bit too much suction. At the highest speed settings, it vacuumed itself solidly to the beaker’s bottom, making it very difficult for us to make any movements. For a better performer overall, we recommend the [Vitamix 5-speed](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/vitamix/vitamix-immersion-blender/) or the [KitchenAid cordless](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/kitchenaid/kitchenaid-khbbv53/) hand blender.

### Frozen Fruit Smoothie

" width="300px" height="200px">

Blending Time: 58 secs

Result: Smooth

Suction: Slightly

Our BELLA transformed all the ingredients into a drinkable texture in approximately one minute, from start to finish. It didn’t have too much difficulty powering through frozen fruit or kale. The resulting smoothie was acceptable with very few unprocessed chunks.

### Mayonnaise

Emulsifying Time: 1 min 25 secs

Result: Smooth

Suction: Yes

Making mayonnaise was easy with this blender. Of all the blenders we tested, it was among the fastest, beating our favorite blender — the [Braun MultiQuick-5](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/braun/braun-multiquick-5-blender/) by up to 30 seconds. That said, its mayonnaise didn’t come out very smooth and creamy. Still, for such a low-priced hand blender, this result is worthy of praise.

### Almond Milk

Grinding Time: 1 min 15 secs

Result: Coarse

Suction: Tightly

Our non-dairy milk required nearly a minute and a half of blending, but it still didn’t come out as smooth and creamy as it should. And not only couldn’t the machine blend uniformly, but it also created bad suction, causing a mess when we struggled to lift it upward.

### Whipped Egg-Whites

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl1xci591000ebq880rd65zi4.jpg" alt="The 24-oz plastic beaker containing testing beaten egg-white is put upside down on the gray table with a BELLA motor body and a smartphone displaying the total whipping time (3 minutes) by its sides.

Beating Time: 3 minutes

Result: Stiff

Suction: No

The BELLA’s whisk attachment drew enough air into the egg whites to create stiff peaks in our test, but its prolonged beating operation left us with exhausted hands and extreme discomfort. So, even though this add-on can do the trick, we don’t think it’s a good alternative to a hand mixer when it comes to preparing emulsified sauces or meringue. There are other immersion blenders that can ensure smoother operations, such as the [KOIOS 4-in-1](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/koios/koios-4-in-1-immersion/) and the [Breville Control Grip.](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/breville/breville-bsb510xl-control-grip/)

Design: Not Really Stand-Out
----------------------------

design Scores: **7.5**

*   Build Quality (60%) - **7.0**/10
    
*   Blending Shaft (30%) - **7.5**/10
    
*   Power Cord (5%) - **10**/10
    
*   Beaker (5%) - **10**/10
    

This machine is one of dozens of nearly identical low-priced hand blenders on the market that have no particular standout features. It sports a mid-powered motor that allows you to switch between various speed settings. And just like any portable item, it is designed for small spaces.

### In the Box

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl1x0m6mt0001bq880h4v3bfh.jpg" alt="The BELLA Stick Blender is shipped with a paper carton box, an immersion blending wand, a motor body, a plastic beaker, a whisk attachment, a food processor, and a user manual." width="300px" height="200px">

*   Motor body 
*   Blending shaft 
*   Whisk attachment
*   Food processor
*   Beaker   
*   User manual

Our set includes six pieces which are all free of harmful chemicals. All parts except the motor section are top-rack dishwasher safe.

### Dimensions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl1x0qcsg0002bq8897h226nu.jpg" alt="The BELLA Immersion Blender standing on top of its blending shaft on a gray table, with the length of the blending shaft being noted to the side as 8.3 inches, and the total length of the unit as 15.2 inches. " width="300px" height="200px">

Height: 15.2" (38.6 cm)

Width: 2.3" (5.8 cm)

Weight: 2.0 lbs (0.9 kg)

Shaft Length: 8.3" (21.1 cm)

So far, we haven’t encountered any challenges caused by this blender’s size. The machine itself is compact enough to store in a drawer, and it isn’t overly heavy. Weight isn’t a hindrance to the machine’s usability.

### 7.0 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl1x0vhzw0003bq889o394edy.jpg" alt="The whisk attachment, motor body, and blending shaft of the BELLA stick blender lie flat on a gray table." width="300px" height="200px">

The BELLA can be purchased for less than $30, but that low price tag is a clue as to its quality. The machine itself feels relatively solid, but it doesn’t look as sleek as the mid-range ones. With the exception of the blending shaft, all the parts are made of medium-grade plastic which may deteriorate and collect scratches over the years. 

Not only that, but several Amazon users have complained about the inner components. Some claim that the plastic core that connects the blending wand to the main body somehow got shredded, rendering the blender useless. Others were frustrated when the tabs that connect to attachments broke. 

All things considered, we don’t think the BELLA is a reliable performer, even though it’s backed by an impressive warranty (two years).

### Speed and Controls

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl1x0zmo00004bq886se2b40w.jpg" alt="A close-up of the two speed control buttons of the BELLA immersion blender. " width="300px" height="200px">

Activation: Press-button & speed dial

Min Speed: 14,730 RPM

Max Speed: 16,000 RPM

Presets: No

Noise Level: 84 dB

Digital Display: No

Pulse Mode: Yes

On paper, the BELLA allows the users to easily switch between 10 speed options using the two front buttons and a top dial. Our real-world experience, though, indicates that while they get the job done, it takes a lot of force to press the buttons.

Likewise, the speed dial isn’t really essential. It’s hard to use because both hands are engaged while blending — one hand to maneuver the blender and the other to keep the beaker from jumping around the countertop with the motor’s violent vibration.

### 7.5 - Blending Shaft

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl1x1lqus0005bq8831pfbipo.jpg" alt="A close-up of the BELLA’s blending wand with 4 sharp stainless steel prongs. " width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl1x1oytu0006bq88h12i98fy.jpg" alt="A close-up of the BELLA’s blending wand with 4 sharp stainless steel prongs from the side-viewing angle." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Stainless steel

Type: Sharp Blade

Guard Material: Stainless steel

Blade Count: 4

Removable: Yes

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

The blade has 4 prongs made of medium-quality stainless steel. It comes relatively sharp, but looks a bit fragile. If you use this blender for grinding tough ingredients, the blade assembly may get damaged.    

We appreciate that the blade guard was designed to prevent splattering, but don't think that it works as intended. It creates a lot of suction at the bottom of our beaker. And since it’s made of metal with harsh edges, the blade guard can leave marks on your non-stick cookware unless you blend very carefully.

### 10 - Beaker

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl1x1t57a0007bq881tz5b5lj.jpg" alt="A 30-oz plastic beaker of the BELLA Immersion Blending standing on a gray table. " width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic

Capacity: 30 oz

Measurements: Yes

Weight: 0.29 lb

Height: 7.2" (18.3 cm)

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

The BELLA blender comes with a large beaker that shows measurements in both milliliters and fluid ounces. It’s a simple affair with an easy-pour spout and a flared base for stability.

### 10 - Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl1x1wn4t0008bq880gr78x5h.jpg" alt="The BELLA 10-Speed  Immersion Blender on a gray table with its power cord rolled up next to it." width="300px" height="200px">

Cord Length: 5.1 ft (1.6 m)

Type: 2-prong plug

Detachable: No

The power cord is long enough to reach your nearby outlets. As a nice bonus, it has a small loop that allows you to hang the whole blender on a hook for easy storage.

### Extra Accessories: Whisk Attachment

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl1x20yfo0009bq8862kg7531.jpg" alt="A whisk attachment of the BELLA hand-held blender lying flat on a gray table. " width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Removable: Yes

With the whisk attachment, your blender can act as a hand mixer for certain tasks such as whipping cream, beating egg whites, and emulsifying sauces. That said, it’s rather poorly built, so it may not survive long.

### Extra Accessories: Food Processor

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl1x2d2c1000abq882klneujf.jpg" alt="A food processor attachment of the BELLA hand blender standing on a gray table. " width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic and Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Removable: Yes

We haven’t tested this attachment, but the stainless steel S-blade can probably chop, mix, and shred certain foods just like any other low-grade food processor.

Usability: A little Bit Disappointing
-------------------------------------

usability Scores: **6.3**

*   Ease of Use (60%) - **6.0**/10
    
*   Blade Assembly (10%) - **7.5**/10
    
*   Handling (20%) - **6.0**/10
    
*   Cleanability (10%) - **7.5**/10
    

This blender can't completely live up to its purpose. We were frustrated with it at every turn, from ease of use to cleanability. Below you can read our quick-hit notes on things that will possibly impair your blending experience.

### 6.0 - Ease of Use

The controls are easy to understand, but we never got comfortable actually operating it. While its interface is very intuitive with only two buttons and a speed selection dial, the motor’s vibration made our hands entirely numb. Moreover, the buttons are too stiff and unresponsive, so our fingers got tired in a hurry. In some cases our fingers slipped right off the trigger button, causing unplanned interruptions to our testing process. 

The low rating of this blender’s usability isn’t all due to its controls, though. Throughout most of the tests, the blending shaft stuck itself so tightly to the container’s bottom that we couldn’t lift it up unless we shut off the motor. That’s quite unacceptable, in our opinion.

### 7.5 - Blade Assembly

To blend, attach the blending wand or any mixing accessories to the main body by turning it in a counter-clockwise direction until tightened.

### 6.0 - Handling

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl1x2ku1s000bbq883ib48054.jpg" alt="Someone uses two hands to control the BELLA immersion blender: one for holding the handle and pressing the power button at the same time, the other for rotating the speed dial. " width="300px" height="200px">

Designed with an ergonomic handle, this blender is meant to be comfortable to grip, reducing hand and wrist pain. Due to its violent vibration and stiff buttons, however, our hands got tired anyway.

### 7.5 - Cleanability

All the included accessories are top-rack dishwasher-safe and easy to clean manually. The main difficulties are in a few hard-to-reach spots such as the backsides of the blades. We had to use a bit of elbow grease on the food tailings.
