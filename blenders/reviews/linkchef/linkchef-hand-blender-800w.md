Overall Score: **6.2**

*   Performance (50%) - **5.2**/10
    
*   Design (20%) - **7.5**/10
    
*   Usability (30%) - **7.1**/10
    

The LINKchef is an economical option, suitable for users who have basic blending needs and don’t frequently engage in complex or heavy-duty performance. While it comes with an accessory kit that adds some versatility, its overall performance remains squarely in the average range. This means for simple tasks like puréeing hot soup or preparing sauces, the LINKchef is quite adequate. However, when it comes to more demanding blending jobs, such as processing frozen fruits for smoothies, its performance may be underwhelming.

**Things We Like**

*   Sufficient motor power suitable for basic tasks
*   Extensive selection of speed options
*   Solid, mid-level construction quality
*   Array of adaptable accessories

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Susceptibility to scratches
*   Overwhelming suction strength

LINKchef has recently introduced a new blender that is claimed to handle up to 99% of food preparation tasks, thereby reducing the need for multiple kitchen appliances. Featuring a durable blending shaft, adjustable speed settings, and a comprehensive set of accessories, this blender appears well-equipped to deliver on this promise. However, we know that real-world performance is key; mere advertising claims are often overstated. To this end, we conducted a series of tests, comparing the LINKchef with a range of [popular immersion blenders](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/immersion-blenders/). The upcoming results may reveal a performance that's more ordinary than extraordinary for its price range.

Performance
-----------

performance Scores: **5.2**

*   Hot Soup Purée (35%) - **6.5**/10
    
*   Smoothie (30%) - **0**/10
    
*   Mayonnaise (15%) - **9.0**/10
    
*   Almond Milk (15%) - **7.5**/10
    
*   Whipped Egg-Whites (5%) - **9.0**/10
    

In our testing, the LINKchef offered acceptable performance for its price. It handled basic tasks like pureeing vegetables, whisking eggs, and grinding nuts adequately, yet struggled with more demanding tasks, like blending frozen fruits, due to insufficient power.

### Hot Soup Purée

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clqq0lb6z001itf88ekia1xmk.jpg" alt="Scooping a spoon of pureéd soup produced by the LINKchef from the plastic beaker to check its smoothness." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clqq0lysy001jtf882ssj9hmc.jpg" alt="A batch of soup pureéd by the LINKchef immersion blender is checked for smoothness by being drained through a stainless steel mesh strainer." width="300px" height="200px">

Pureeing Time: 30 seconds

Result: Chunky

Suction: Tightly

We used the LINKchef to puree a mixture of pumpkin, carrot, and celery for 30 seconds. The resulting puree appeared visually uniform, but post-straining revealed small unprocessed vegetable pieces. We deem this performance is generally fine for home cooking like soups, stews, or baby food, but it doesn't achieve the ultra-smooth texture required for professional culinary standards.

Should you be looking for [greater alternatives](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/), consider options like the [Vitamix 5-speed](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/vitamix/vitamix-immersion-blender/), [Braun MultiQuick-5](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/braun/braun-multiquick-5-blender/), or the [Ninja Foodi](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/ninja/ninja-foodi-ci101-power-mixer-system/).

### Smoothie

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clqq0nkty001ktf88ak41cr7w.jpg" alt="A hand holding a spoonful of a chunky, unevenly blended green and orange mixture above the LINKchef immersion blender, demonstrating the results of a failed frozen fruit smoothie test with the LINKchef blender." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clqq0o4ah001ltf88f0ndc0mn.jpg" alt="Top-down view of a partially blended mixture in a glass container." width="300px" height="200px">

Blending Time: Failed

Result: Failed

Suction: Slightly

Even after blending for three minutes—an interval that exceeds the time other blenders typically require for a smooth concoction—the LINKchef did not effectively pulverize the tough kale and frozen fruits. The result was a coarse mixture with noticeable chunks, not the chilled, creamy consistency we were after. 

For consumers seeking to make icy drinks or frozen fruit smoothies, this blender is apparently less than an ideal choice.

### Mayonnaise

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clqq0r189001mtf8879gg5mz6.jpg" alt="A mayonnaise preparation using a LinkChef immersion blender, with a timer tracking the blending duration." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clqq0stig001ntf88gykz6600.jpg" alt="A Close-Up  of The LINKchef Mayonnaise" width="300px" height="200px">

Emulsifying Time: 1 min 35 secs

Result: Smooth

Suction: Yes

In stark contrast to earlier tests, the LINKchef impressed with its mayonnaise-making capabilities. The whisk attachment was central to this achievement. In a short span of one minute and thirty-five seconds, it skillfully whipped oil and egg yolk into a nearly-perfect emulsion. 

You might notice an issue with the beaker wobbling during blending, but this can be resolved by using a more stable container or securing the beaker in a bowl to prevent movement.

### Almond Milk

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clqq0uplv001otf881nk9evf5.jpg" alt="A white plate of almond pulp and a bowl of milk produced by theLINKchef stick blender within 1 minute and 20 seconds." width="300px" height="200px">

Grinding Time: 1 min 20 secs

Result: Smooth

Suction: Tightly

Achieving the task efficiently in just 1 minute and 20 seconds, the LINKchef paralleled the median performance of other mid-range blenders we tested. On examining the results post-straining, we found the almonds had been ground to a fine texture. This helped enrich the milk with a creamy consistency, robust flavor, and the natural nutrients inherent in the almonds.

### Whipped Egg-Whites

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clqq0vq2y001ptf88eamx2ux8.jpg" alt="The plastic beaker containing beaten egg-white of the LINKchef immersion blender is put upside down on the table;  a smartphone displaying 1 minute and 45 seconds by its sides." width="300px" height="200px">

Beating Time: 2 minutes

Result: Stiff

Suction: No

To assess the LINKchef’s versatility, we challenged its whisk attachment to whip 100ml of egg whites into stiff peaks. The blender achieved this in two minutes, a timing that, though slightly longer than a specialized mixer, is reasonable for an immersion blender. The resulting foam was notably stable and airy, successfully holding its shape even when the bowl was flipped over.

Height: 16.0" (40.6 cm)

Width: 2.8" (7.1 cm)

Weight: 1.7 lbs (0.8 kg)

Shaft Length: 8.2" (20.8 cm)

The LINKchef's design adheres to the standard size of hand blenders, making it a good fit for most users. Its length and weight do not seem to pose any usability issues. The 8.2-inch blending shaft is particularly noteworthy as it offers the flexibility to blend in deep pots.

### 7.0 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clqq1avnq001vtf8827ez5d16.jpg" alt="A close-up of the blending wand, milk frother, and motor housing of the LINKchef immersion blender. " width="300px" height="200px">

In terms of build quality, the LINKchef does not stand out from the crowd but also doesn't fall behind; it meets the expectations for a blender at its price point. The overall construction is a blend of mid-grade plastic and metal. Wear such as scratches on the plastic surface are an expected part of the usage lifecycle, but are not indicative of any structural or functional deficiencies.

### Speed and Controls

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clqq1bqac001wtf8897hyeien.jpg" alt="A close-up of the LINKchef’s front buttons" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clqq1c8ez001xtf883vi6hmqh.jpg" alt="A close-up of the LINKchef’s top-mounted dial." width="300px" height="200px">

The LINKchef is equipped with a versatile 20-speed setting, fine-tuned via an easy-to-use dial and button combination, allowing for a wide range of blending intensities. Since each speed increment is clearly defined, it offers tangible control over the blending process, enabling precision in achieving the desired results. 

### 7.5 - Blending Shaft

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clqq1dqw8001ytf88deiy8p13.jpg" alt="A Close-Up of the LINKchef Blade Assembly" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Stainless steel

Type: Sharp Blade

Guard Material: Stainless steel

Blade Count: 2

Removable: Yes

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

The blade assembly of the LINKchef is standard, featuring a stainless steel, two-pronged blade typical of mid-range immersion blenders. Along with the blades, the unit includes a blade guard made from non-reactive material. This guard serves multiple purposes: it protects the container from scratches, improves spatter control, and enhances blending efficiency by channeling ingredients toward the blades to create a more effective vortex.

### 10 - Beaker

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clqq1fxeo001ztf88bbw9hbdg.jpg" alt="A Close-up of the LINKchef beaker." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic

Capacity: 27 oz

Measurements: Yes

Weight:

Height:

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

The included 27-ounce beaker that comes with the LINKchef serves well for small to medium blending operations. It may show signs of wear such as marking from the intense blending over time, but this is a common occurrence with such plastic accessories.

### 10 - Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clqq1h2fy0020tf88dr8mggxd.jpg" alt="A Close-up of the LINKchef power cord." width="300px" height="200px">

Cord Length: 5.1 ft (1.6 m)

Type: 2-prong plug

Detachable: No

With a lengthy power cord, the LINKchef blender ensures convenience in kitchen setup. A handy plastic clip accompanies the cord, helping to maintain a tidy, untangled storage state.

### Extra Accessories: Whisk Attachment

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clqq1i2zd0021tf88a1ue8a95.jpg" alt="A close-up of the LINKchef whisk attachment." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Removable: Yes

For activities such as whipping cream or beating eggs, the LINKchef's whisk attachment does the job with its stainless steel wires that seem durable enough toward regular uses.

### Extra Accessories: Food Processor

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clqq1j5o40022tf885s4g2vmz.jpg" alt="A close-up of the LINKchef food processor" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic and Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Removable: Yes

The food processor attachment of the LINKchef's is intended for typical food processing tasks. Although we haven't put it to the test, its convenience is clear. It just will not offer the full range of performance seen in specialized food processors.

### Extra Accessories: Milk Frother

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clqq1k5lk0023tf8888oj62tv.jpg" alt="A close-up of the LINKchef milk frother." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic and Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Removable: Yes

Our review of the LINKchef's milk frother is pending, but it's intended for milk aeration, a feature useful for achieving the creamy froth needed in various coffee drinks. 

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **7.1**

*   Ease of Use (60%) - **6.3**/10
    
*   Blade Assembly (10%) - **8.5**/10
    
*   Handling (20%) - **8.0**/10
    
*   Cleanability (10%) - **8.5**/10
    

Our LINKchef blender is manageable in weight and basic in its controls. Its ergonomically-designed handle provides some comfort, but this doesn't fully compensate for the difficulty in maneuvering the blender when it is firmly suctioned to the container.

### 6.3 - Ease of Use

While stiff to the touch, the front buttons respond promptly to input. The real challenge arises when adjusting the speed through a top-mounted dial during blending, though. Imagine trying to precisely rotate the dial with one hand, while the other hand is tasked with both handling the active blending shaft and ensuring the stability of the beaker. 

Compounding this issue is the strong vibration from the motor. This vibration not only makes the beaker wobble noticeably but also creates a vacuum-like effect at the bottom of the beaker. We observed that this often results in splattering when the blender is moved.

### 8.5 - Blade Assembly

To set up the blender, we aligned its blending  attachment with the motor body and pushed until it was firmly in place. The connection felt solid but was more of a snug fit than a clicky engagement. This aspect of the design doesn't notably impede the ease of assembly; however, from a personal standpoint, we found ourselves preferring the tactile confirmation of a click. Disassembling the blender was just as simple: a gentle counterclockwise rotation of the attachment, followed by a pull away from the body. 

### 8.0 - Handling

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clqq1l7v90024tf88bua9h58o.jpg" alt="Someone is holding the LINKchef’s handle." width="300px" height="200px">

Throughout our testing, we found the blender's handle to be consistently comfortable to hold, thanks to its ergonomic design. Its lightweight also played a key role in warding off hand fatigue, even in long and strenuous blending sessions. A point to consider, though, is that the handle's smooth finish could make gripping it less secure in situations where hands are wet or have grease on them.

### 8.5 - Cleanability

The blender is generally easy to clean, with the blending wand and attachments responding well to a simple rinse and scrub under running water. However, cleaning around the blades can be more challenging due to the tight space between the blade and its housing, making the removal of stubborn residues a bit cumbersome.
