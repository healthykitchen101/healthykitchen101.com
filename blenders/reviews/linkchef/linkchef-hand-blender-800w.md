The LINKchef is an economical option, suitable for users who have basic blending needs and don’t frequently engage in complex or heavy-duty performance. While it comes with an accessory kit that adds some versatility, its overall performance remains squarely in the average range. This means for simple tasks like puréeing hot soup or preparing sauces, the LINKchef is quite adequate. However, when it comes to more demanding blending jobs, such as processing frozen fruits for smoothies, its performance may be underwhelming.

**Things We Like**

*   Sufficient motor power suitable for basic tasks
*   Extensive selection of speed options
*   Solid, mid-level construction quality
*   Array of adaptable accessories

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Susceptibility to scratches
*   Overwhelming suction strength

LINKchef has recently introduced a new blender that is claimed to handle up to 99% of food preparation tasks, thereby reducing the need for multiple kitchen appliances. Featuring a durable blending shaft, adjustable speed settings, and a comprehensive set of accessories, this blender appears well-equipped to deliver on this promise. However, we know that real-world performance is key; mere advertising claims are often overstated. To this end, we’ve put our LINKchef immersion blender to a course of tests. The upcoming results may reveal a performance that's more ordinary than extraordinary for its price range.

In our testing, the LINKchef offered acceptable performance for its price. It handled basic tasks like pureeing vegetables, whisking eggs, and grinding nuts adequately, yet struggled with more demanding tasks, like blending frozen fruits, due to insufficient power.

### Hot Soup Purée

Pureeing Time: 30 seconds

Result: Chunky

Suction: Tightly

We used the LINKchef to puree a mixture of pumpkin, carrot, and celery for 30 seconds. The resulting puree appeared visually uniform, but post-straining revealed small unprocessed vegetable pieces. We deem this performance is generally fine for home cooking like soups, stews, or baby food, but it doesn't achieve the ultra-smooth texture required for professional culinary standards.

Should you be looking for alternatives capable of finer pureeing, consider options like the [Vitamix 5-speed](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/vitamix/vitamix-immersion-blender/), [Braun MultiQuick-5](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/braun/braun-multiquick-5-blender/), or the [Ninja Foodi](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/ninja/ninja-foodi-ci101-power-mixer-system/).

### Smoothie

Blending Time: Failed

Result: Failed

Suction: Slightly

Even after blending for three minutes—an interval that exceeds the time other blenders typically require for a smooth concoction—the LINKchef did not effectively pulverize the tough kale and frozen fruits. The result was a coarse mixture with noticeable chunks, not the chilled, creamy consistency we were after. 

For consumers seeking to make icy drinks or frozen fruit smoothies, this blender is apparently less than an ideal choice.

### Mayonnaise

Emulsifying Time: 1 min 35 secs

Result: Smooth

Suction: Yes

In stark contrast to earlier tests, the LINKchef impressed with its mayonnaise-making capabilities. The whisk attachment was central to this achievement. In a short span of one minute and thirty-five seconds, it skillfully whipped oil and egg yolk into a nearly-perfect emulsion. 

You might notice an issue with the beaker wobbling during blending, but this can be resolved by using a more stable container or securing the beaker in a bowl to prevent movement.

### Almond Milk

Grinding Time: 1 min 20 secs

Result: Smooth

Suction: Tightly

Achieving the task efficiently in just 1 minute and 20 seconds, the LINKchef paralleled the median performance of other mid-range blenders we tested. On examining the results post-straining, we found the almonds had been ground to a fine texture. This helped enrich the milk with a creamy consistency, robust flavor, and the natural nutrients inherent in the almonds.

### Whipped Egg-Whites

Beating Time: 2 minutes

Result: Stiff

Suction: No

To assess the LINKchef’s versatility, we challenged its whisk attachment to whip 100ml of egg whites into stiff peaks. The blender achieved this in two minutes, a timing that, though slightly longer than a specialized mixer, is reasonable for an immersion blender. The resulting foam was notably stable and airy, successfully holding its shape even when the bowl was flipped over.

Design

*   Build Quality (60%) - **7.0**/10

*   Power Cord (5%) - **0**/10
    
*   Beaker (5%) - **10**/10
    

The LINKchef’s aesthetic is straightforward, lacking the luxury vibe of premium models, yet its build quality is unexpectedly decent for its price range. It retains all the common features of a standard blender, with the notable addition of a rubber blade guard to shield against container scratches.

### Dimensions

Height: 16.0" (40.6 cm)

Width: 2.8" (7.1 cm)

Weight: 1.7 lbs (0.8 kg)

Shaft Length: 8.2" (20.8 cm)

The LINKchef's design adheres to the standard size of hand blenders, making it a good fit for most users. Its length and weight do not seem to pose any usability issues. The 8.2-inch blending shaft is particularly noteworthy as it offers the flexibility to blend in deep pots.

### 7.0 - Build Quality

In terms of build quality, the LINKchef does not stand out from the crowd but also doesn't fall behind; it meets the expectations for a blender at its price point. The overall construction is a blend of mid-grade plastic and metal. Wear such as scratches on the plastic surface are an expected part of the usage lifecycle, but are not indicative of any structural or functional deficiencies.

### Speed and Controls

Activation: Press-button & speed dial

Min Speed: N/A

Max Speed: N/A

Presets: No

Noise Level: N/A

Digital Display: No

Pulse Mode: Yes

The LINKchef is equipped with a versatile 20-speed setting, fine-tuned via an easy-to-use dial and button combination, allowing for a wide range of blending intensities. Since each speed increment is clearly defined, it offers tangible control over the blending process, enabling precision in achieving the desired results. 

### 7.5 - Blending Shaft

Material: Stainless steel

Type: Sharp Blade

Guard Material: Stainless steel

Blade Count: 2

Removable: Yes

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

The blade assembly of the LINKchef is standard, featuring a stainless steel, two-pronged blade typical of mid-range immersion blenders. Along with the blades, the unit includes a blade guard made from non-reactive material. This guard serves multiple purposes: it protects the container from scratches, improves spatter control, and enhances blending efficiency by channeling ingredients toward the blades to create a more effective vortex.

### 10 - Beaker

Material: Plastic

Capacity: 27 oz

Measurements: Yes

Weight:

Height:

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

The included 27-ounce beaker that comes with the LINKchef serves well for small to medium blending operations. It may show signs of wear such as marking from the intense blending over time, but this is a common occurrence with such plastic accessories.
