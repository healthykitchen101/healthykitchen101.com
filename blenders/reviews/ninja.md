Reviews of the Best Ninja Blenders 2023
---------------------------------------

Let's examine our top recommendations closely. Here is a preview of the Ninja blenders we find to be most promising.

1\. Best Overall: Ninja AMZ493BRN Compact Kitchen System

*   Robust build and catchy design. 
*   Excellent ice-crushing capability. 
*   A generous set of accessories allows for a wider range of tasks.
*   User-friendly control panel for simple, straightforward operation.

*   Mediocre at processing leafy vegetables. 
*   The blending jars tend to show wear, particularly in the form of scratches.

The Ninja AMZ493BRN impresses with a sophisticated design complemented by a diverse set of accessories. With a robust 1200-watt motor at its heart, this blender can move seamlessly from crafting smoothies to kneading dough to acting as a reliable food processor. Plus, its multiple container sizes (72 oz, 40 oz, and 18 oz) give it lots of flexibility.

Measuring at 17.3 inches tall and 7.9 inches wide, it comfortably fits most kitchen counters. You’re still best off reserving some spare space on your countertop for ingredients, though.  

When put to the test, it pulverized ice cubes to a snowy consistency in no time. It also could prepare frozen fruit smoothies, almond butter, and protein shakes. The only hiccup was in fully liquifying greens like kale, since it left our green smoothie a tad more textured than we’d prefer.

Design-wise, the motor's sleek and sophisticated construction lets it run long and hard without overheating or undue vibrations. Similarly, the lid and blade assembly showcase commendable quality and balance. However, users should anticipate some superficial wear on the blending container over time, like light scratching and reduced luster. It’s annoying, but doesn’t detract from the performance. 

In terms of usability, the Ninja AMZ493BRN could use a touch of refinement. Our blending tests required occasional pauses to ensure even consistency, though that might not be a deal-breaker for everyone. Cleaning was mostly a breeze thanks to the dishwasher-safe parts, though the blade assembly called for a bit more attention.

2\. Best Ninja Personal Blender: Ninja Fit

*   A great tool for any quick blend that involves fibrous greens, frozen food, raw nuts, or even ice cubes. 
*   Compact, straightforward design makes it easy to use, assemble, and clean. 
*   The blending blade shows great attention to detail with 4 sharp, well-designed prongs.
*   The price is very reasonable.  
*   Its final results were consistently smooth in all of our tests. 
*   Extra blending cups are included.

*   It doesn’t allow for hands-free operation 
*   A little shaking is necessary for an even blend.

The Ninja Fit is one of the company’s most basic models. It’s packed with a 700-watt motor and features a sporty design. Ranking well among our [top-rated personal blenders](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/personal-blenders/), it even works better than some larger blenders and is super fast at pulverizing fruits or green vegetables, even when they’re frozen. 

During our smoothie-making test, it performed like a beast, drawing all the solid fruits toward its blades entirely on its own. On top of this, the smoothie it produced was exceptionally smooth. A smattering of seeds remained intact, but didn’t offend our taste buds. Few personal blenders in our test performed so well; some needed a shake to dislodge jammed fruits, while others couldn't power through frozen ingredients. 

In the other tests, this blender delivered perfect outcomes as well. The crushed ice came out with a snow-like texture, the protein shake was a chunk-free mix, and the leafy greens couldn’t have been blended finer. 

The Ninja Fit is compact and lightweight, making it easy to store. Its dimensions are 13.7 inches in height (with the cup attached), 9.45 inches in depth, and 6 inches in width. The material quality and construction are commendable for its price point, even if it doesn't lead in its category. Some reviews have reported leaks at the machine's base, but we've yet to encounter this. It's possible that overfilling causes this issue, so you shouldn’t cram too much into the blender cup. 

This personal blender doesn’t have a typical control panel, speed selector, or on/off button. The motor engages when you press the cup against the base unit. You need to hold the cup down throughout the whole blend. We appreciate this feature for its inherent safety and the control it provides over blending.

3\. Round-Up Personal Blender: Ninja BN401 Nutri Pro

*   It excels in most functions, especially ice-crushing and smoothie-making.
*   The 1000-watt motor gives it robust performance. 
*   Its smart preset programs ensure consistent results.
*   Thoughtful design elements enhance the blender's overall appeal.

*   The motor base is comparable in size to regular full-sized blenders.
*   The motor is loud.

While the Ninja Fit distinguishes itself as a compact and budget-friendly option, chefs who prioritize capacity and advanced features might find the Ninja BN401 to be a superior choice.

The Ninja BN401 Nutri Pro’s contemporary and sleek design sets it apart from its counterpart. A standout set of programmable blending presets not only shine in terms of functionality but also consistently meet expectations. This sophistication, however comes at the cost of a larger footprint and a higher price tag compared to the Ninja Fit.

In contrast to most other plastic blenders, the BN401 showcases a glossy finish and artful trim, making it an elegant addition to any countertop. Its durable plastic container remained immaculate even after numerous tests, and the motor base showed no signs of scratches or wear. 

Performance-wise, our rigorous testing has revealed the Ninja BN401 is comparable to the Ninja Fit when blending dense and fibrous whole foods. Whether it was leafy greens, berry seeds, or raw nuts, this blender could consistently churn out creamy textures. But its superiority doesn't end there. Powered by a more robust motor (1000 watts), this blender even outperformed the Ninja Fit when it comes to crushing ice.

Nearest Competitors
-------------------

[Ninja BL480D Nutri](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/ninja/ninja-bl480d-nutri/): The Ninja Nutri is a high-end personal blender that sharply contrasts with the simpler design of the Ninja Fit. Designed to radiate a luxurious aura, it merges sophisticated technology with hands-free functionality. However, its performance doesn't quite match that of the Ninja Fit. While it cleared all our tests, the results were generally not as refined as those from its counterpart. Our protein shake test left some small berry and almond chunks, and the fibrous green drink contained noticeable leafy fragments. 

[Ninja BN701](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/ninja/ninja-professional-plus-bn701/): The Ninja BN701 initially impressed us with its powerful 1400-watt motor that did particularly well during ice-crushing tests. However, as we experimented with tougher ingredients like dense oatmeal, raw nuts, and kale, the blender's performance seemed more in line with the Ninja AMZ493BRN. We also noted some design problems. Most concerning was a high-pitched noise that occurred just after the second test, which suggested that the motor itself might be damaged. 

How We Test Our Ninja Blenders
------------------------------

Our aim is to bring tangible value to your kitchen by running real and relevant tests. Recognizing that different styles serve different purposes, we've tailored our testing methods to three distinct types: full-sized, personal, and immersion blenders. For a transparent and comprehensive comparison, we apply the exact same battery of tests to every device within each given category.

Before diving into our official testing phase, we conduct a series of "preliminary tests". This approach lets us identify any potential issues with the testing methods themselves and adjust them so they’ll render accurate results. Throughout the official testing process, we meticulously document our findings, supplementing them with photographic and video evidence.

For a deeper dive, see our general testing guide. 

How Our Recommendations Are Made
--------------------------------

Recommendations are based upon the testing results and their associated scores. We take into account the specialized strengths of each product, the situation it’s best suited for, and the personal circumstances where it will fit best. 

Things to Keep in Mind When Buying a Ninja Blender
--------------------------------------------------

Every Ninja blender has its own strengths, so your quest to find the perfect Ninja blender should begin by evaluating your own needs. Here, we lay out the primary considerations, dissecting each aspect from motor power to accessories, to help inform your decision process. 

### Understanding the Ninja Blender Lineup 

The blender you choose should align with your culinary goals, frequency of use, and the volume of food or drink you intend to prepare. Each type of blender has its own unique benefits, making them more suitable for some tasks than others. 

#### 1\. Immersion Blenders (Hand Blenders)

Immersion blenders, also known as stick or hand blenders, are primarily designed for blending, pureeing, and emulsifying directly in your pots, pitchers, or bowls. Their capacity is thus defined by your choice of blending vessel. 

*   Ideal For: Hot soups, sauces, baby foods, whipped cream, or quick in-glass smoothies.
*   Advantages: Lightweight, easy to clean, and space-saving. 

Here’s the basic stats on Ninja’s immersion blender:

| Models | Power | Price | Key Features |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ninja CI101 Foodi Power Mixer System | 750 watts | $60-$130 | Variable speed control Stainless steel blending shaftTwo beaters and a whisk attachment |

#### 2\. Personal Blenders (Single-Serve Blenders)

Specifically tailored for on-the-go individuals, personal blenders are often the best option if your mornings are fast-paced or tightly scheduled. While they are optimized for single servings, they don't compromise on blending quality.

*   Capacity: 12 to 32 ounces.
*   Ideal For: Morning smoothies, post-workout shakes, or small-batches of salsa and dressing.
*   Advantages: Compact and space-efficient. Many models, like the Nutri Ninja series, have blending cups that double as portable containers.  

Here's a spotlight on some of the standout personal blenders from Ninja's lineup:

| Ninja BL480D Nutri | 1000 watts | $80-$120 | Auto-iQ technologyOne-touch intelligence |

#### 3\. Full-Size Countertop Blenders 

Full-size countertop blenders are designed as stationary kitchen appliances, primarily for blending, mixing, and emulsifying ingredients in large quantities. With its larger footprint and prominent presence on the kitchen counter, this blender is intended to cater to families, group gatherings, or other big-batch tasks. 

*   Capacity: 64 to 72 ounces
*   Ideal For: Large volumes of soups, smoothies, frozen treats, dough, or any extensive blending activity.
*   Advantages: Powerful motors and variable speed settings characterize these blenders. Brands like the Ninja Professional series take it a step further by integrating smart technology, such as Auto-iQ. 

We've listed the specifics of Ninja's most sought-after full-sized blenders to give you a clearer perspective:

| Series | Models | Power Range | Price Range | Key Features |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ninja Professional | BL610 BL660 BL740BN701 BN801 | 1000-1400 watts | $70 - $150 | Total crushing technology |

| Ninja Chef Hi-Speed | CT800 CT805 CT810 | 1500 watts | $150 - $300 | Ten manual mode speedsPreset functions Tamper for thick mixtures |

### Motor Power 

From a modest 400 watts in their compact personal models to a roaring 1500 watts in some countertop variants, Ninja caters to a diverse array of blending needs. If you want extra power for tasks such as crushing ice or grinding tough ingredients, Ninja's higher-wattage machines are a fitting choice.

*   400-600 watts: Ideal for simple blending tasks. This range is perfect for creating smoothies with soft fruits (like bananas and berries), blending cooked vegetables for soups, and concocting salad dressings.
*   600-900 watts: Suited for intermediate blending tasks. They efficiently handle harder fruits, can break up ice, and will serve you well for protein shakes and green smoothies with fibrous vegetables.
*   900-1200 watts: Designed for more demanding tasks. These models excel at pulverizing tough ingredients like nuts, seeds, and frozen fruits. Additionally, they’re perfect for crafting nut butters, grinding coffee beans, and crushing ice.
*   Above 1200 watts: Built for heavy-duty blending. These robust machines are capable of a variety of tasks—from transforming raw vegetables into smooth purees to kneading dough,  grinding hard grains to delivering slushies and frozen desserts with the finest consistency.

### Versatility and Accessories 

We believe the importance of accessories largely hinges on individual needs and preferences. 

Culinary enthusiasts who delight in everything from smoothies to dips and dough will be quite justified in dropping the cash on a Ninja blender with a full suite of accessories like the [Ninja SS401](https://www.amazon.com/Ninja-SS401-Processing-Extractor-Functions/dp/B098RCQVRB/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3OH5WQ0XLGBV9&keywords=ninja+blender+Ninja+Foodi+HB152&qid=1692936610&sprefix=ninja+blender+%2Caps%2C1126&sr=8-1). 

The single-serve cups, for instance, are invaluable for quick morning smoothies, and the inclusion of a dough blade is a boon if you’re into baking. Plus, the food processor attachment means you might not need a separate food processor.

However, it's worth noting that juggling multiple accessories can become cumbersome, especially if you’re short on storage space. If that’s an issue, you may wish to opt for a more basic variant without the extra attachments.

Our Expertise 
--------------

Tina is a seasoned tester who’s been with us at Healthy Kitchen 101 since 2018. She brings with her a wealth of experience in different types of blenders including immersion, personal, and full-sized models. Her most recent testing initiative was a result of her collaboration with our Chef Tuyet Pham and Test Lead Lap Vo. Together, they conducted in-depth research, developed a test process, and analyzed the recipes. 

Over the course of two years, Tina and her team have tested more than 35 blenders using a combination of laboratory-style testing and real-world usage scenarios. They wanted to evaluate the appliances not only in brand-new condition but also after months of regular use. Their methodical execution and attention to detail resulted in accurate and reliable testing results.
