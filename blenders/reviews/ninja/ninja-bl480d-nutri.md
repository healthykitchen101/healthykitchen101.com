The Ninja BL480D Nutri is special with its own goodies, but for a machine that costs this much money, we had hoped for the best quality textures; this blender’s testing results simply didn’t blow our minds.

Although it made protein shake, blended leafy greens, and liquefied frozen fruit with ease, there were other personal blenders that could do the same or even better while costing twice as less. The high-powered motor and solidly-designed blades also give it the edge over the competition when it comes to crushing ice cubes, but again, the Ninja BL480D Nutri couldn’t be ahead of the game, though it did grind far better than most of its rivals in our testing. 

If you love the common simplicity and compact footprints of [Ninja personal blenders](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/ninja/), you may not be wild about the Ninja BL480D Nutri. It is bulky, demands some time to learn, and leans heavily on gimmickry.

Overall, the Ninja BL480D Nutri is an above-average all-arounder so considering its price tag, we just don’t think it is a good value for money.

**Things We Like**

*   A powerful motor allows for heavy-duty blending 
*   Stainless steel extractor blades are exceptionally tough
*   Hands-free operation offers greater convenience 
*   Sturdy motor base ensures stable performance 
*   Blending cups are included with to-go lids

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   It’s heavy and quite bulky
*   The control panel is gimmicky 
*   The feets’ suction is so strong making it challenging to remove the base
*   The premium price tag might be a high barrier for many people

The Ninja BL480D Nutri is meant to provide powerful performance and consistent results in a single-serving blending cup. On paper, it’s so strong that it can even pulverize ice to a snow-like consistency without difficulty, to say nothing of simpler tasks like juice, frozen mixtures, sauces, and icy desserts. But how does it perform in the real world? We put it through our rigorous tests to find out; If it lives up to the hype, it might be the [best blender](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/) in the market.

Performance: Top-Rated Results
------------------------------

performance Scores: **8.8**

*   Protein Shake (40%) - **8.8**/10
    
*   Frozen Fruit Smoothie (30%) - **9.5**/10
    
*   Fibrous Greens (20%) - **8.0**/10
    
*   Crushed Ice Cubes (10%) - **8.0**/10
    

While the Ninja Nutri is advertised as a personal blender, it actually features a powerful motor worthy of a full-sized blender. As such, in our hands-on testing, it was more efficient than most rivals. Still, its outcomes were not always the best. Ultimately, we don’t think you need to fork over so much cash for a personal blender when there are cheaper, smaller, and better options like the [NutriBullet](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/nutribullet/nutribullet-900-watt-pro/) and the [Ninja QB3001SS Fit](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/ninja/ninja-qb3001ss-fit/).

### Protein Shake

" width="300px" height="200px">

Blending Time: 1 min 10 secs

Result: Silky Smooth

The Ninja Nutri is essentially a single-serve blender but refinements to its blades and motor’s power have brought it many advantages over the competition. 

You might notice the blade assembly looks like nothing else in the market. Design-wise, it is attention to detail with four sharp, sophisticated prongs. Beyonds spinning extremely speedy, the prongs are towards various sides to allow for more food contact at a time. And such combos did make our Ninja Nutri among the fastest blenders in this test, taking one minute and ten seconds to yield a serving of protein shake. Not to mention the 1000-watt motor which helped churn through ingredients like almonds, dried berries, oatmeal, with super ease. 

As efficient as it was, this blender still underperformed by a few seconds against two top competitors (the Ninja Fit and the NutriBullet), though. The texture it delivered also had room for improvement since while the oatmeal was completely broken down, small amounts of almonds and berries remained solid. Considering the price, we had wished for a chunky-free texture which was exactly similar to those we got from its counterparts. 

Overall, unless you’re really interested in its professional look and hi-tech features, there are some alternatives that can actually blend your drink better and do so at less than half the price.

### Frozen Fruit Smoothie

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6ywjjtc001pbx88c1q0b0vo.jpg" alt="Ninja BL480D Nutri Frozen Fruit Smoothie Video" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6yuljib001bbx88asxjem8d.jpg" alt="To check for solid chunks, after finishing blending, the fruity smoothie made by the Nutri Ninja single-serve blender is spread throughout a white paper with a smartphone displaying the total blending time ( 1 minute and 5 seconds) next to it." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6yuilxe001abx8874ctclfd.jpg" alt="A spoon of fruity smoothie packed with blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, and mango made by the Nutri Ninja single blender with Auto-IQ." width="300px" height="200px">

Blending Time: 1 min 5 seconds

Result: Silky Smooth

A great [personal blender for smoothies,](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/personal-blenders/) the Nutri Ninja was excellent at this test. Again, its distinctly-designed blades and higher-powered motor were good things for a quick, even outcome. They allowed the blender to power through all the frozen mango, strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries to perfection in just over one minute. And we remember everything was very easy and simple here, which you will rarely experience with other weaker personal blenders. Just noting that the process was fifteen seconds slower than that of the [NutriBullet](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/nutribullet/nutribullet-900-watt-pro/), but this wasn’t a huge gap. You might be willing to wait a bit longer as long as you get good results. 

Initially, we intended to use the Auto-IQ Ultra Blend setting, but the testing trials then suggested us shifting to the regular one. When running on the Auto-IQ Ultra Blend mode, your blender will blend in short intervals in 60 seconds and there will be a unique pulsing and pausing pattern after each interval. This is meant to force all the clogged ingredients back down onto the blades to even out the blend. 

That being said, we don’t think this is highly necessary in making icy smoothies; frozen fruits need to blend as fast as possible, but the pausing intervals give them time to thaw and then dilute the consistency. Perhaps, the Auto-IQ technology is better for dry-grinding harder ingredients like whole ice cubes and raw nuts.

### Fibrous Greens

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6zuvmza0000c688erd2hnfn.jpg" alt="Ninja BL480D Nutri Fibrous Greens Video" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6yv2su1001dbx88fx10b5q8.jpg" alt="A glass of water combined with fibrous greens pulp produced by the Ninja BL480D Nutri 1000-Watt.

" width="300px" height="200px">

Blending Time: 20 seconds

Result: Medium-FineMedium-Fine

The blender’s ability to process leafy vegetables was above average. The final drink came out acceptably uniform but with a gritty texture. We don’t think you’ll get too many complaints if you run everything through a mesh strainer before drinking. Given its high-end price tag, however, we expected better results with fewer leafy chunks.

### Crushed Ice Cubes

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6zv6ycb0001c688c5x44tmt.jpg" alt="Ninja BL480D Nutri Crushed Ice Video" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6yv5j3l001fbx88cz7eg59n.jpg" alt="A black tray of crushed ice produced by the Nutri Ninja Personal Blender being on a table. " width="300px" height="200px">

Ice Fineness: Coarse

Unblended Ice: 0% of 6 oz

As a personal blender, this Nutri Ninja didn’t perform half bad, grinding 6 oz of whole ice cubes in just 22 seconds. None of the other blenders we tested could do the same; some took longer to entirely break up the ice while others were simply not powerful enough to churn through such a solid ingredient. (For example, the [KOIOS Pro](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/koios/koios-850w-bullet/) and the [Oster](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/oster/oster-blstpb-wbl/))The crushed ice didn’t have a snow-like texture, but would be good enough for your cocktails.

Design

design Scores: **9.7**

*   Build Quality (60%) - **9.5**/10
    
*   Blades (20%) - **10**/10
    
*   Blending Cup (20%) - **10**/10
    

The Ninja Nutri is a very capable blender, so it scores well in most of our evaluations. The trouble is that it is very expensive and far bulkier and more complex than any personal blender should be. If you are short on cooking space, don’t want to fuss with settings, and expect to get your money’s worth, then those are issues.

### Dimensions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clfi1prpn0005le886tsy95ki.jpg" alt="The Ninja Nutri 1000-watt personal blender standing on a gray table, with the length of its motor base being noted to the side as 8.2 inches, and the total length and width of the unit as 14 inches and 6.5 inches, respectively." width="300px" height="200px">

Height: 14.2" (36.1 cm)

Width: 6.4" (16.3 cm)

Weight: 5.4 lbs (2.4 kg)

The Ninja Nutri is larger and bulkier than your average single-serve blender. The motor section looks more like a full-sized countertop version, coming in at 14.5 inches tall by 6.2 inches wide. At 5.4 pounds, it’s also heavier than most, so you may find it difficult to move your blender in and out of storage.

### 9.5 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6yvclct001ibx88grclebob.jpg" alt="The motor base and blending cup of the Ninja BL480D Nutri single-serve blender lying side by side on a white table." width="300px" height="200px">

Build quality does match the price point. It’s good, with many parts — to include the entire exterior — made of anti-scratch plastic. We haven’t had to deal with problems like discoloration, paint peeling, or inner components wearing out. Additionally, the construction is sturdy enough to hold up frequent use, so you will get stable performance and consistency for many years.

### 10 - Blades

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6yvhn2g001jbx88gpenff0a.jpg" alt="A close-up of the blade assembly featuring 4 stainless steel prongs of the Ninja BL480D Nutri Auto-IQ personal blender." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6yvl62p001kbx8826qbeyu3.jpg" alt="The blade assembly featuring 4 stainless steel prongs of the Ninja BL480D Nutri Auto-IQ personal blender being on a gray table." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Stainless Steel

Type: Cross

Blade Count: 4 blades

Removable: No

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

The blade features 4 hardened stainless steel prongs. It is super sharp and has a high-quality feel. Unfortunately, the blades can’t be removed from the base, so cleaning their undersides is pretty tricky.

### Motor Base

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6yvy6u7001lbx881na38tq6.jpg" alt="A close-up of the front interface of the Ninja BL480D Nutri Motor Base." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6yvyxwg001mbx887hrxhfc3.jpg" alt="A close-up of the Ninja BL480D Nutri Motor Base." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6yvzq8b001nbx88gv30cwc7.jpg" alt="A close-up of the underside of the Ninja BL480D Nutri Motor Base.

" width="300px" height="200px">

Rated Voltage: 110 - 120 V

Rated Power: 1000 Watt

Working Time: ≤ 1 minute

Protection: No

Weight: 4.5 lbs (2.0 kg)

Cord Length: 2.6 ft (0.8 m)

Extra Feature: Silicon feet, cooling fan, anti-slip pads

The motor comes with many user-friendly components. They include a cooling fan to prevent overheating, suction feet to help the blender stand firm against heavy-duty tasks, and small anti-slip pads to minimize the risk of sliding on wet surfaces. We’re also impressed with the inner parts which are all well-made and detailed. 

Just be aware that the motor should not run for more than one minute continuously. If your recipes demand longer than this timeframe, blending for 1-minute intervals can help you avoid overheating. In the event your machine gets too hot, a built-in thermal switch will engage and stop the motor from running. To reset, you’ll have to unplug and let it cool down for 30 minutes before blending again.

### Speed and Controls

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clcfsljnd000cme8865pbhg57.jpg" alt="Someone is measuring the noise level of the Ninja BL480D Nutri personal blender with the noise meter (103.6 dB)." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clbor71sx002i9t885jyk4cwt.jpg" alt="A close-up of the control panel of the Ninja BL480D Nutri which features the Start/Stop, Pulse, Auto-IQ Blend, and Auto-IQ Ultra Blend button. " width="300px" height="200px">

Activation: Button

Min Speed: N/A

Max Speed: 18,637 RPM

Presets: No

Noise Level: 103 dB

Digital Display: No

Pulse Mode: No

The front interface is intuitive, featuring four buttons that correspond to four different options. As a visual aid, this model also has a digital display which indicates the elapsed blending time or counts down to the end of a preset program. 

If you want continuous blending, press the Start/Stop button. To avoid chopping ingredients too finely, use the Pulse function. For fresh or softer ingredients, the Auto-IQ Blend button will help you create consistent results without relying on guesswork. There is also the Auto-IQ Ultra Blend button, which runs the blender at its fastest speed tobreak ice cubes, fibrous greens, whole grains, or frozen mixtures down to a lump-free consistency. 

We found that the speed settings work very well. Each step gives you a noticeable change in power level. For the most part, however, we agree with some reviewers that it feels a bit gimmicky because single-speed blenders generally work just as well.

Note that regardless of the speed setting, this Nutri Ninja is terribly noisy. If noise is a major factor in your buying decision, this one’s not for you.

### 10 - Blending Cup

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9mer8qw000rvu88e5p35m6d.jpg" alt="Two blending cups of the Ninja BL480D Nutri on a table, with dimension measurements written to the side.

" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic

Capacity: 18- and 24-oz

Weight: 0.5- and 0.58-lb

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Measurement: No

Suitable For: Small and medium batches

Accessories: 2 to-go lids

This set includes two blending cups which can be used interchangeably with the extractor blade. Each cup comes with a tight-seal lid featuring a flip-top spout for mess-free drinking on the go.

Usability: Excellent Blending Comfort
-------------------------------------

usability Scores: **9.7**

*   Hands-Free Operation (60%) - **10**/10
    
*   Assembly (20%) - **9.5**/10
    
*   Cleanability (20%) - **9.0**/10
    

The Ninja Nutri is kind of impressive in that it looks fussy and technical, but is easy to figure out in practice. Once you get used to it, cleaning and assembling are simple as well.

### 10 - Hands-Free Operation

This blender is more convenient to use than others because the cup can be locked in place; you won’t need to hold the cup continuously to engage the motor. Additionally, once activated, it draws almost everything toward its blades, creating a homogeneous mixture without extra shaking or stirring.

### 9.5 - Assembly

To set up the blender, simply attach the extractor blade to the cup, turn the whole assembly upside down, and place it on the motor base. Once the display reads “0,” press one of the buttons to start blending. When your drink is complete, simply pull the cup out from the motor base and serve. Note that you must pull with quite a bit of force compared to other blenders we tested, so it may be tougher to remove when your hands are wet or oily.

### 9.0 - Cleanability

We cleaned the cups, lids, and blade manually with soapy water, but they’re also safe to put in the dishwasher. Of all those parts, the blade’s backsides were the trickiest to clean, so make sure you have a straw-cleaning brush available. 

The motor base only took us a couple of minutes to wipe down. Unplug the device and use a dish cloth dampened (but not soaked) with soapy water to wipe down exterior surfaces and the inside of the cup receptacle. We never had any leakage during our tests, so we didn’t have to contend with stubborn food on the actuator tabs or other components.
