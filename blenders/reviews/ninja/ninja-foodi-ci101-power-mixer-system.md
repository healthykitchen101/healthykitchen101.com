The Ninja CI101 Foodi is a decent immersion blender that can provide heavy blending performance. Our extensive testing confirmed its exceptional capabilities. With a force so powerful that you can feel it in each rotation, this blender defied all challenges, be it rock-solid frozen fruits to high-fiber ingredients like celery and raw almonds. To harness its full potential, however, ensure you pair the blender's larger head with a suitably sized mixing container. 

### Hot Soup Purée

Pureeing Time: 30 seconds

Result: Exceptionally Smooth

Suction: No

Our testing of the Ninja Foodi's pureeing performance delivered exceptional results. The machine's blades quickly created a flawlessly smooth purée in an astonishing 30 seconds. The final product was not just tactilely smooth but also impeccably uniform in texture. Straining revealed only trace amounts of solids. This suggested the Foodi's outstanding ability to thoroughly extract the essence and nutrients of the soup ingredients. Moreover, the entire process was a model of kitchen efficiency — clean, controlled, and free from any mess. 

### Smoothie

Blending Time: 2 mins 40 secs

Result: Velvety

Suction: No

During our testing of the Ninja Foodi for preparing a frozen fruit smoothie, we achieved a blend with a velvety, creamy consistency. Even challenging ingredients like fibrous leafy greens, such as kale, were smoothly transformed into a fine puree with ease. This outcome, however, was not without its challenges. 

The entire blending process took nearly three minutes, significantly longer than expected and almost three times slower than our quickest blender—the [Braun MultiQuick-5](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/braun/braun-multiquick-5-blender/). This delay was partly due to the mismatch between the blender's large head and the narrow cup we selected for the test, which restricted the blades' movement and limited their ability to circulate and blend the fruits efficiently. 

Nonetheless, we believe that with a blending container more appropriately sized to match its head, the Foodi could not only continue to deliver high-quality blends but also could become an ideal solution for those in search of smooth and quick blending results.

### Mayonnaise

Emulsifying Time: 1 min 45 secs

Result: Smooth

Suction: Yes

In this test, we used the Ninja Foodi's whisk attachment to prepare mayonnaise and recorded a completion time of 1 minute and 45 seconds. While this wasn't the fastest time we've seen, it was still within a reasonable range. The resulting mayonnaise had a satisfactory emulsion, though it was somewhat greasier than ideal, likely due to the size of the oil droplets within the mixture. Plus, the texture was initially stable and maintained shape, but a few hours later, we noticed weeping, indicating a decline in emulsion stability over time.

### Almond Milk

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clps48qer00082i887x3fcka0.jpg" alt="The Ninja CI101 Foodi immersion blender beside its bowl of almond milk and the corresponding almond pulp produced in 1 minute 01 second. " width="300px" height="200px">

Grinding Time: 1 min 01 secs

Result: Fine

Suction: No

Starting with soaked almonds, we introduced them to our Ninja Foodi along with water. The blender's TURBO feature activated a vigorous, yet controlled whirl, turning the almonds into a finely milled mixture in above one minute. Upon straining, the pulp was a bit coarser compared to what you might get from the likes of the Braun MQ7035X, yet the almond milk itself was delightfully creamy.

### Whipped Egg-Whites

Beating Time: 1 min and 45 secs

Result: Stiff

Suction: No

Outfitted with its whisk attachment, the Ninja Foodi shifts its role from immersion blender to a competent hand mixer. This versatility shone through during our egg-white whipping test, where it effortlessly achieved stiff peaks in just under 2 minutes. Given that perfection, the Ninja Foodi is clearly an excellent choice for the culinary minimalist who values versatility and functionality without the clutter of numerous gadgets.

The Ninja CI101 Foodi Power Mixer System combines high performance with a sophisticated design. Its build quality is excellent, with a catchy, luxurious visual and a finer refinement than typically seen in this category. However, its larger size does mean that it requires more storage space, and it may not conveniently fit in a drawer, especially considering the array of accessories it includes. It might also make your blender less maneuverable for quick, small tasks or when blending in smaller containers.

The Foodi’s exceptional build quality is evident in every aspect, from the careful selection of materials to the precision of its engineering, complemented by its aesthetic appeal and thoughtful ergonomic design.

The main body is crafted from a combination of high-quality plastics and metals, giving it an upscale feel and adequate robustness. The blending shaft is engineered to fit securely into the motor body, guaranteeing stable operation without any unwanted vibrations. Additionally, the blades are crafted from hardened stainless steel, a choice that ensures they maintain their sharpness over time and resist corrosion. 

After a few months of usage, we noticed the white paint along the trim has started to show signs of chipping and wear. Nonetheless, this is purely a cosmetic concern and doesn’t impact the blender's performance.

Usability

*   Cleanability (10%) - **8.0**/10
    

Despite being on the heavier side, the Ninja CI101 is still ranked as our most user-friendly immersion blender. If you're considering this blender, you're choosing a model with straightforward controls, easy-to-change attachments, and a hassle-free cleaning process – all key factors for excellent usability."

### 8.1 - Ease of Use

Our experience with the Ninja CI101 Foodi highlighted its impressive ease of use. One of its most remarkable features is the vortex action, which effortlessly pulls ingredients toward the blades, ensuring a consistent blend without the need for manual mixing. This is particularly beneficial for thicker mixtures where uniform blending can be challenging.

Another aspect we appreciated was the bell-shaped guard around the blades. This clever design significantly cuts down on the mess, especially when blending liquids, making the process cleaner and more efficient. It's also a boon for reducing the suction effect, often a nuisance with immersion blenders, especially in deeper vessels.

The blender's blade guard is made of a non-metal material. It means you don’t have to be overly cautious about scratching your pots and pans, a common concern with metal-bladed immersion blenders.

However, we did notice that the size of the blender head is somewhat larger than typical models. This can be a bit of a hurdle in smaller containers or when working with limited quantities. But, with a bit of practice and adjustment, we assure that you’ll quickly adapt and find it manageable.

### 9.5 - Blade Assembly

The Ninja immersion blender sets itself apart with dual ejection buttons designed for immediate response. A gentle press is all it takes to release attachments smoothly, eliminating the common struggle with forceful detachment.

When it comes to reassembling, the process is just as user-friendly. The design ensures that you don't need to wrestle with alignment; the parts naturally orient themselves correctly. With a gentle push, the attachments slide into place and a reassuring click signals a secure and stable connection, ready for your next blending task.

### 9.0 - Handling

We commend the ergonomic design of the Ninja Foodi Immersion Blender for its comfortable grip, which effectively combats the hand fatigue associated with continuous kitchen tasks. The thumb-accessible power button is another plus Yet, Nevertheless, it's worth mentioning that the hefty weight of the blender could be a drawback for those with weaker hand strength. 

### 8.0 - Cleanability

Rinsing the blender under the tap generally removes most residues like soup or smoothie leftovers effectively. However, for stickier substances such as mayonnaise, manual cleaning with dish soap was essential for a more thorough cleanse. During this process, we encountered difficulty in reaching and cleaning the backside of the blades. The challenge stemmed from the narrow space between the blades and their housing, which restricted the movement of a sponge or cloth.
