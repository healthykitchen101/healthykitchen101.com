In our testing, the Ninja BN701 Professional Plus Blender proved to be effective at crushing ice. To its credit, this Ninja has a powerful rotation speed and solid blades. It’s just that when put to the test with tough items like kale, oatmeal, almonds, dried berries, and frozen fruit, the performance was average at best.

Perhaps our tests were a little challenging, which means the Ninja BN701 is only really good for simple tasks. Despite its 1400W motor, innovative design, and comfortable price range, we’re still hesitant to recommend it as a worthwhile blender to buy.

**Things We Like**

*   Modern aesthetic design
*   Intuitive interface
*   Great for ice and nuts

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Green smoothies a challenge
*   Subpar build quality

As Ninja continuously innovates and introduces new blender models, the BN701 Professional Plus represents a step forward in their [countertop blender lineup](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/ninja/), building upon the success and feedback received from earlier models. You might be wondering what makes the Ninja BN701 special. From its stacked blade assembly, Auto-iQ technology, and modern aesthetic design, it’s clearly a non-typical blender. It suggests a hint of class without being badass or upscale. For this reason it’s a [popular blender](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/) for how it redefines conventional design standards. However, the question arises whether it’s worth the price or just a gimmick trying to pimp revolutionary design.

For lovers of fruit smoothies and those who need an ice-crushing blender, the Ninja BN 701 might just be the one. However, if green smoothies or perhaps homemade almond butter are more your style, this Ninja is a definite let-down.

### Smoothie

Blending Time: 3 mins

Result: Chunky

In this test, the Ninja BN 701 proved how well it can liquify a range of fruits. Notably, within a mere 30 seconds, it smoothly blended bananas, apples, and pineapples without any chunks left behind. 

The same results, however, were not achieved with kale which landed up with significant leaf strips remaining. Even with three extra minutes added to the blending time, the results were still wanting and the smoothie wasn’t really smooth.

The Ninja’s shortcoming became more apparent with further performance comparisons There was little change in the liquids consistency after 30 seconds of additional blending compared to extended periods of blending. 

This clearly suggested inherent constraints with the Ninja BN 701's ability to process leafy greens. . 

Ultimately, if you want to make green leafy smoothies, this is not the blender for you. There are more suitable blenders comparable both in price and power ratings. These would include the [NutriBullet](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/nutribullet/nutribullet-znbf30500z-blender-combo-1200w/), [Oster Pro](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/oster/oster-pro-1200-blender/), and [Black+Decker](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/black-decker/black-decker-bl2010bg/).

### Frozen Fruit Smoothie

Blending Time: 4 mins

Result: Silky Smooth

In this test, the Ninja BN 701 delivered a slightly improved performance compared to the green smoothie test. Dealing solely with frozen fruits in this trial, the blender produced a silky-smooth mixture.There was a negligible amount of strawberry skin which is quite common to various other blenders. 

However, it's important to highlight that the Ninja BN 701 required a total of 4 minutes to achieve this result. This is four times longer than the pricey [Vitamix 5200](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/vitamix/vitamix-5200/) and twice as long as other similarly-priced blenders, like the NutriBullet and the Oster Pro. We later surmised that this outcome was a direct result of the distinctive configuration of the blender's blade. 

The Ninja’s blade features a stacked design with multiple blades positioned at different heights. This purpose seems to be to target all levels of the container, not just contents near the bottom. Although an original design, it failed to consistently pull ingredients towards the blades for finer processing. 

In actual fact, we noticed how the centrifugal force constantly pulled the food outward and upward, away from the blades. 

In order to get a passable result, we had to pause the blending process multiple times, manually forcing the ingredients down toward the blades using a spatula. This was further complicated by the space occupied by the blade assemblies from the top to the bottom. 

In short, despite the smooth and drinkable enough smoothie yielded, the frustration was not worth it.

### Protein Shake

" width="300px" height="200px">

Blending Time: 4 mins

Result: Smooth

When it comes to making protein-based shakes, the Ninja BN701 was once again a mixed bag.. For this test, we selected a hearty mix of oats, dried blueberries, crunchy almonds, and creamy milk. The blender took up to 4 minutes to fully blend the ingredients, which was twice the average. Again, the lengthy blending time was due to the ineffectiveness of the blender's blades in pulling ingredients towards the center. 

However, we have to admit that every second is worth the wait as the Ninja BN701 created an almost perfect protein shake. While there were a few remnants of almond and blueberry skin, the oatmeal gracefully surrendered, transforming into a silky liquid state. This created a taste sensation that was simultaneously smooth and gratifying.

### Almond Butter

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cluhwx5j5001stf885soqc6td.jpg" alt="Ninja Professional Plus Blender BN701 Almond Butter Thumbnail" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clifqua0o0007ls88fs3l99b3.jpg" alt="The Ninja BN701 Professional Plus is beside a white plate containing almond butter with a spatula, blend assembly, and a smartphone revealing a blending time of 5 minutes." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clifquvzh0008ls88a6wo029g.jpg" alt="A sample of almond butter created with the Ninja BN701 Professional Plus blender, spread on white paper." width="300px" height="200px">

Blending Time: 5 mins

Result: Smooth

Making almond butter with the Ninja BN 701 was not as simple as we expected. Although initial blending was swift enough, the same design issues persisted. Larger fragments of almonds adhered to the sides while contents near the blade were a smoothly blended butter. Trying to move contents with a spatula (as with the fruit smoothie) didn’t help much and it took 5 minutes to produce a somewhat acceptable paste.

### Crushed Ice

Ice Fineness: Very Fine

Unblended Ice: 0% of 12 oz

Among all the tests we’ve performed, crushing ice is wherethe Ninja BN 701 truly stood out. We have put numerous blenders through this particular task, yet none could match the Ninja BN 701. In just 20 seconds, it turned 12 oz ice into a fluffy, like-snow consistency.

The Ninja BN701 blender is17 inches tall and weighs 8 pounds. It takes up a fair amount of countertop space, but is lightweight and easy to move around. The built quality appears good but there are lingering durability issues. For one, the plastic container tends to scratch easily and the stacked blade assembly can damage if misaligned.

Width: 9.3" (23.6 cm)

Weight: 8.0 lbs (3.6 kg)

Length: 6.6" (16.8 cm)

The Ninja BN 701 is about the size of a standard coffee maker, so it takes up a decent amount of space. An open space on a kitchen island or table is ideal, but under a low cabinet could present a challenge. On the other hand, its relative light, weighing 8 pounds, so it's easy to move around.

### 5.5 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clifqz55t000bls88gzmug6qb.jpg" alt="A closeup of the Ninja BN701 Professional Plus blender motor base and container" width="300px" height="200px">

The Ninja BN701 Professional Plus Blender Motor Base and Container

The Ninja BN701 material quality is slightly above average, but not without its flaws. It has a sturdy motor base and virtually indestructible stacked blade assembly. The container, however, is made of medium-grade plastic. After just a few uses, it began to show scratches and lost its sheen. 

Another issue is the misalignment between the blade assembly and the lid. .During our testing, the blade swirled in such a way that it slightly damaged the lid. 

Additionally, during the almond butter test, we noticed a high-pitched whining sound. The issue remains unresolved and often gives the impression that the blender will break down or a component is worn out. Despite this, the blender still operates reliably enough.

### 6.0 - Blades

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clifr2u0c000dls88dzsjd6j5.jpg" alt="A closeup of the Ninja BN701 Professional Plus blender stacked blade assembly" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clifr3avw000els884sed7u6b.jpg" alt="A closeup of the Ninja BN701 Professional Plus blender stacked blade assembly" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clifr3viy000fls88a13if8ax.jpg" alt="A closeup of the Ninja BN701 Professional Plus blender’s container, stacked blade assembly, and lid." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Stainless Steel

Type: Stacked

Blade Count: 6 sharp blades

Removable: Yes

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

The Ninja BN 701 blender stands out for its stacked blade assembly of six distinct blades staggered at various heights within the blending jar. We found this design only effective for quick and easy chopping. When it comes to blending, pureeing, and mixing, the blender does struggle a lot to pull ingredients towards the blades efficiently. This often results in gritty outcomes or requires extended blending time to achieve smoother results.

### Motor Base

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clifr593n000gls88gb1t2b6o.jpg" alt="A close-up of the Ninja BN701 Professional Plus blender’s motor" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clifr69ns000hls8866bb11hm.jpg" alt="A close-up of the Ninja BN701 Professional Plus blender’s motor" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clifr6rje000ils8889c17z4k.jpg" alt="A close-up of the Ninja BN701 Professional Plus blender’s motor" width="300px" height="200px">

Rated Voltage: 120 Volts

Rated Power: 1400 Wattages

Working Time: N/A

Protection: Yes

Weight: 5.3 pounds

Cord Length: 2.8 ft (0.9 m)

When operating at top capacity, the motor can reach an output of 1400 watts. As a safety feature, the blender will only operate when the lid is tightly secured and the container is securely positioned on the base. As mentioned, the blade assembly does not align correctly with the lid, but this doesn't prevent the motor from running.

There are four suction feet at the bottom that provide stability and prevent the blender from moving while operating . The feet grip very firmly, especially on flat, smooth surfaces, so lifting the applicant can be a little bit tricky.

### Blending Container

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clifrcl8t000jls886w4a0wqd.jpg" alt="Illustrated dimensions of the Ninja BN701 Professional Plus blender container showing the height and diameter in inches." width="300px" height="200px">

The Ninja BN701 Professional Plus Blender’s Container

Material: Plastic

Capacity: 72 oz

Weight: 2.7 pounds

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Measurement: Yes

Suitable For: Large batches

The Ninja BN701’s blending container blender's container has a 72-ounce capacity, so it is tailored for blending large batches of food, drinks, or smoothies in one go. It also features a built-in pour spout which is basically spill proof . Furthermore, the whole package comes with an array of measuring cups marked in ounces, liters, and milliliters— all clear and easy to read.

### Lid

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clifredsh000kls886su43ig6.jpg" alt="A close-up of the Ninja BN701 Professional Plus blender’s lid" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clifrm1vi000lls8890rabujy.jpg" alt="A close-up of the damage caused by blade assembly misalignment" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic

Closing Type: Lock Mechanism

Features: Pouring Spout with Cap

The lid is made of hard plastic. Unlike friction-based lids, its locking mechanism is easy to operate with a responsive release button and push-and-lock handle. Additionally, the locking mechanism acts as a safety feature, preventing the blender from operating if the lid is not properly attached. We also appreciate a pouring spout on the lid, which is really convenient for controlled and mess-free pouring.

### 8.5 - Control Panel

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clifrn39q000mls88e6j87478.jpg" alt="A close-up of the Ninja BN701 Professional Plus blender’s control panel" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clk0lvsjn000veg881vg0bqlg.jpg" alt="The Ninja BN701 Professional Plus Min Speed" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clk0lwt20000weg880mou8c3b.jpg" alt="The Ninja BN701 Professional Plus Max Speed" width="300px" height="200px">

Max Speed: 5,101 RPM

Presets: Yes

Digital Display: No

Built-in Timer: No

Pulse Mode: Yes

The Ninja BN701 blender's control panel is simple and intuitive. Buttons are logically arranged and clearly labeled with related functions neatly grouped together. You may find the buttons relatively stiff, but overall, this a minor drawback and does not significantly impact the blender’s usability.

### Extra Accessory

Usability

usability Scores: **NaN**

*   Ease of Blend (40%) - **6.0**/undefined

The Ninja BN701 is not quite a 'set and forget' blender. Because the vortex action doesn’t draw ingredients efficiently towards the blades, it’s often necessary to manually intervene. As a large-sized blender, the noise level is relatively high but tolerable. On the other hand, assembly is a breeze, but the blade assembly's alignment requires extra attention due to the lack of clear indicator

### 6.0 - Ease of Blend

Compared to the usual kind of blender, the Ninja BN701 is not the most convenient to use. Due to the stack blade design, the blending jug contents are not so efficiently drawn in. This means you often have to open the lid to stir or scrape in stuff that gets missed or pushed to the edges. This, however, is not so easy since the prongs stretch from top to bottom and obstruct the path of the scraper.

What’s more, the blade assembly lacks a locking mechanism which means it must be removed, particularly when dealing with thick mixtures that can't be poured through the spout. This then requires space to rest the blade assembly, thus adding an extra, inconvenient step to the blending process.

### 7.1 - Noise Level

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clifro4r6000nls882zlab3ue.jpg" alt="The Ninja BN701 Professional Plus blender is on a table, accompanied by a sound level meter displaying its recorded noise level.

The Ninja BN701 Professional Plus Blender in Our Noise Level Test

Max Level: 99.3 dB

We used ice cubes and water as testing ingredients. The noise level of the Ninja BN701 averaged around 99.7 dB. This is relatively loud, equivalent to the sound produced by a vacuum cleaner or motorcycle engine. It’s bearable though because the pitch is not so harsh or grating.

### 8.5 - Assembly

Attaching the container to the motor and then securing the lid is a straightforward process. We found the symbols on the components are very helpful. These visual guides simplify the task with an easy-to-follow roadmap for proper alignment. Although it may take some time to become familiar with everything, with a bit of practice, you'll quickly master it. 

Our main concern lies with the blade assembly. Even when improperly attached to the lid, it still operates. For this reason, you l need to be extra cautious during each blending session because there are no indicators or clicking sound to confirm that the blade assembly is correctly positioned.

### 6.5 - Cleanability

All the components of the blender, with the exception of the motor base, are safe for cleaning in the top rack of a dishwasher. Fortunately, the motor base, with its smooth surface, can easily be cleaned by just wiping down. 

However, extra care must be taken when manual cleaning the blade due to its sharpness and intricate design. To avoid accidental cuts, cautious handling is required during the cleaning process. 

There is a small cavity, known as a ‘coupling’ which ensures a loose fit of the blade onto the drive gear. Due to its narrow size, this area often captures food particles. This makes it hard to clean manually without a dedicated cleaning brush. The zone around the drive gear at the container’s bottom is also prone to food residue accumulation which can be tough to remove. It typically requires more than a simple rinse under running tap water.
