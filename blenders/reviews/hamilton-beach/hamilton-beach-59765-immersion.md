This Hamilton Beach 2 speed hand blender is by far the worst immersion blender we’ve tested. It feels cheap, looks flimsy, and is not easy to use. Although it did a fine job of preparing baby food, its 225-watt motor wasn’t strong enough to churn through solid ingredients like frozen fruits or raw root veggies.

We were also very disappointed to find that none of the included accessories was actually effective. As cheap as it is, buying this blender is just pouring your money down the drain.

**Things We Like**

*   It can be used for pureeing cooked vegetables, fresh fruits, and baby food.
*   Its easy-grip design allows for flexible control 
*   All the accessories are dishwasher safe

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   It isn’t powerful enough for many blending tasks
*   The two included attachments are almost useless
*   It isn’t durable due to the poorly-constructed design

The Hamilton Beach 59765 has a low price tag yet comes with a wide range of blending accessories. On paper at least, that will help you to perform a greater variety of tasks. With a straightforward design, it should also be a [user-friendly immersion blender](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/immersion-blenders/).

After our course of hands-on testing, however, this machine turned out to be neither practical nor efficient to use. If you have the budget, we recommend going for [higher-powered blenders](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/) — this Hamilton Beach simply causes more trouble than it’s worth.

The Hamilton Beach is designed to be an affordable solution for heavy-duty tasks, but in practice, it ends up a flimsy stick of plastic with low efficiency and inconsistent performance, especially when it comes to processing solid ingredients. If you’re expecting its portability and cheapness to make it fun to use, then you might be surprised to learn its performance was at best dreary in almost all of our tests. For superior alternatives, we recommend considering the [Braun MultiQuick-5](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/braun/braun-multiquick-5-blender/), [Vitamix 5-speed](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/vitamix/vitamix-immersion-blender/), or [cordless Chefman](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/chefman/chefman-cordless/) blenders.

### Hot Soup Purée

Pureeing Time: 30 seconds

Result: Smooth

Suction: Slightly

In this test, the Hamilton Beach produced an acceptably smooth puree, but the outcome wasn’t any better than those produced by other immersion blenders we’ve found for under $40. It was blended evenly but we still noticed a lot of tiny veggie chunks left behind after straining.

### Frozen Fruit Smoothie

Blending Time: 2 mins 15 secs

Result: Chunky and Leafy

Suction: Slightly

Of all the blenders we tested, this Hamilton Beach took the longest to complete this task. It was such a poor performer that had a very hard time processing frozen fruits and couldn’t entirely liquefy kale. In the end, we were left behind with a lumpy icy drink and worse still, a bunch of large noticeable fibrous pieces remained unprocessed.

### Mayonnaise

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl3e37w0q000cbo88611522ub.jpg" alt="Someone is holding a plastic beaker which contains a batch of failed mayonnaise of the Hamilton Beach immersion blender and is between the motor body and a smartphone displaying the total emulsifying time (2 minutes and 8 seconds)." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl3ik8bl300012z88a8bi53j9.jpg" alt="Hamilton Beach 59765 Immersion Mayonnaise" width="300px" height="200px">

Emulsifying Time: N/A

Result: N/A

Suction: N/A

Making mayonnaise with this blender’s whisk attachment was a total failure. Even when we added the oil very slowly to the yolks, there was no way that the blender could form a proper emulsion. Instead of a smooth spread, we ended up with a watery mess. As such, we awarded it no points for this test.

### Almond Milk

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl3e37cr0000bbo8853h5b774.jpg" alt="The Hamilton Beach motor body, a plastic beaker containing almond milk, a white plate of almond pulp, and a small red note displaying the total grinding time (1 minute 40 seconds) being side by side. " width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl3ikm1jm00022z883swr4ei5.jpg" alt="Hamilton Beach 59765 Immersion Almond Milk" width="300px" height="200px">

Grinding Time: 1 min 40 secs

Result: Coarse

Suction: Tightly

Using this Hamilton Beach to make nut milk may not be such a good idea: In our test, it left us with a coarse grind and couldn’t pull all the ingredients into its blades without our intervention. That’s why we had to constantly stir with the blending wand to ensure everything was incorporated. This also meant that, due to the machine’s poor head suction, we would end up getting splattered with smoothie every single time our hand moved. 

At certain points, the almonds somehow even got stuck in the blade guard’s holes, requiring us to stop and dislodge them. This remains the most frustrating blending experience that we’ve ever had.

### Whipped Egg-Whites

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl3e35kqk000abo88he7l085p.jpg" alt="The plastic beaker containing testing beaten egg-white of the Hamilton Beach immersion blender is put upside down on the gray table with its motor body and a smartphone displaying the total whipping time (3 minutes and 22 seconds) by its sides." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl3ijxsfd00002z883q42194b.jpg" alt="Hamilton Beach 59765 Immersion Whipped Egg-Whites" width="300px" height="200px">

Beating Time: 3 min 22 secs

Result: Stiff

Suction: No

Surprisingly, this blender’s whisk attachment did a good job of stiffening the egg white. When beating, it provided enough force to stretch out the egg’s proteins which then bonded with each other and formed a stable network around the tiny air bubbles created through the beating action.

However, strengthening that network for a good stiff peak can be a lengthy process. The Hamilton Beach took more than one minute - compared with others, that's longer than the average. Having to spend a few more minutes blending is no big deal, but the prolonged operation will cause the motor to overheat, thus impairing its durability and your cooking enjoyment. 

Design
------

design Scores: **6.0**

*   Build Quality (60%) - **6.0**/10
    
*   Blending Shaft (30%) - **6.5**/10
    
*   Power Cord (5%) - **10**/10
    
*   Beaker (5%) - **0**/10
    

Efficiency aside, the Hamilton Beach’s compact footprint makes it suitable for those who have limited storage space and want to prepare small batches of puree at a time. Still, it is so poorly constructed that we couldn’t consider it a reliable blender. Our Hamilton actually broke right after it finished the final test. 

### In the Box

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl3dxeu8i0001bo882xed3gy6.jpg" alt="A user’s manual, whisk attachment, blending wand with its motor body attached, paper carton box, and a food processor attachment of the Hamilton Beach hand blender lying side by side on a gray table." width="300px" height="200px">

*   Motor body 
*   Blending shaft 
*   Whisk attachment
*   Food processor 
*   User manual

The Hamilton Beach 59765 set has five pieces, including a motor body, a blending shaft, a user manual, and two extra attachments (a whisk and a food processor). It doesn’t come with a beaker, but you can easily purchase a decent one for under $15.

### Dimensions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl3e351ww0009bo8859nk8juq.jpg" alt="The Hamilton Beach Immersion Blender stands on top of its blending shaft on a gray table, with the length of the blending shaft being noted to the side as 6.9 inches, and the total length of the unit as 14.3 inches." width="300px" height="200px">

Height: 14.3" (36.3 cm)

Width: 2.6" (6.6 cm)

Weight: 1.7 lbs (0.8 kg)

Shaft Length: 6.9" (17.5 cm)

This Hamilton Beach looks compact on our counter and takes up less space than any of the full-sized blenders we’ve had. Its blending shaft and main motor body can be separated so you can easily store them when not in use. It also feels balanced in our hands with an ideal weight for most home cooks. For the most part, we agree it is quite easy to maneuver this machine in a mixing beaker.

### 6.0 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl3e2wi560002bo887nxc6g70.jpg" alt="A close-up of the immersion blending wand, motor body, and whisk attachment of the Hamilton Beach 2-speed hand blender." width="300px" height="200px">

Compared to other low-range blenders we purchased, this Hamilton Beach is similar in features, operation, and capabilities, but it isn’t as good on every front due to its poorly-built construction.

Made of low-range plastic, the motor body takes on food stains and discoloration over time while the inner core is very breakable. The two thin plastic tabs that help connect the blending attachment to the main housing also leave much to be desired. With use, they will possibly snap, thus rendering your blender useless. Another word of caution: this machine has a tendency to overheat like it is burning up.

### Speed and Controls

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl3e2yl0j0003bo883rwb7f05.jpg" alt="A close-up of two speed controlling buttons on the front interface of the Hamilton Beach hand blender." width="300px" height="200px">

Activation: Press-button & speed dial

Min Speed: 15,680 RPM

Max Speed: 17,330 RPM

Presets: No

Noise Level: 96 dB

Digital Display: No

Pulse Mode: Yes

The machine has two buttons: the power button operates the blender at the normal speed and the turbo button provides a temporary speed boost. Both buttons are unresponsive to gentle presses requiring considerable pressure to be activated. During the more prolonged procedures, we experienced challenging and painful blending.

### 6.5 - Blending Shaft

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl3e2zxfc0004bo88ergceypb.jpg" alt="A close-up of the blade assembly sporting 2 sharp prongs of the Hamilton Beach immersion blender." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Stainless steel

Type: Sharp Blade

Guard Material: Stainless steel

Blade Count: 2

Removable: Yes

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

At only 6.9 inches, the blending shaft is quite short and may not be suitable to immerse in your deep pot. With a sharp, metal blade guard, it seriously damaged our beaker and was incapable of reducing head suction in all of its tests. The 2-pronged blade is designed flimsily. It looks inferior and has a shorter length compared to other low-range blenders. This results in quite coarse blends and longer working time.

### Failed - Beaker: Not Included

Material: N/A

Capacity: NaN fl oz (NaN ml)

Measurements: N/A

Weight: NaN oz (NaN g)

Height: NaN" (NaN cm)

Dishwasher Safe: N/A

### 10 - Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl3e30tis0005bo88aeq2cy7w.jpg" alt="The Hamilton Beach Immersion Blender on a white table with its power cord that features a 2-prong plug rolled up next to it." width="300px" height="200px">

Cord Length: 5.1 ft (1.6 m)

Type: 2-prong plug

Detachable: No

This blender has a 2-prong, 5.1. feet power cord that plugs into any standard power supply rated to 120V AC. 

### Extra Accessories: Whisk Attachment

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl3e31st40006bo88c2qcbv1v.jpg" alt="A whisk attachment of the Hamilton Beach stick blender lying flat on a gray table." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Removable: Yes

After two rounds of testing, we found this attachment is completely inefficient. Measuring only 4.3 inches long, it is comparatively short and its wires are too stiff to provide enough ‘bounce’. We certainly wouldn't recommend using this whisk. 

### Extra Accessories: Food Processor

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl3e32de70007bo885u2bczcv.jpg" alt="A food processor attachment of the Hamilton Beach blender standing on a gray table." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic and Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Removable: Yes

We haven’t tested this attachment on a specific recipe, but upon activating it without any contents, we found it to be laced with excessive rattles and vibrations, which fatigued our hands over time. 

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **6.4**

*   Ease of Use (60%) - **5.8**/10
    
*   Blade Assembly (10%) - **8.0**/10
    
*   Handling (20%) - **6.5**/10
    
*   Cleanability (10%) - **8.0**/10
    

When we talk about ease of blending, we mean the immersion blender in question has practical controls, good cleanability, and a user-friendly design —one that allows you to operate your device with minimum distraction. That said, none of the Hamilton Beach 59765 features meet such criteria. In spite of its simple design, it doesn’t work as comfortably as we’d like. 

### 5.8 - Ease of Use

The Hamilton Beach 59765 is not easy to use; it often feels a bit brittle during even simple tasks, and that isn’t indicative of all low-priced immersion blenders. It is also more of a pain to use with a violent shaking motor and unresponsive controls. 

Furthermore, we found our machine got extremely hot when it was working at high speeds toward an extended blending time. It is unclear if this issue is likely to shorten the blender’s lifespan, but it will surely bring you a

few minutes of discomfort.

### 8.0 - Blade Assembly

To set up this blender, the attachment must be rotated to a specific alignment to lock into place with the main housing. So far, we haven't found any difficulty in doing so, since both these two pieces are clearly marked with padlock icons, eliminating our guesswork for the correct alignment.

### 6.5 - Handling

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl3e337ga0008bo88fv4y5c6n.jpg" alt="Someone is holding the Hamilton Beach handle with one hand and pressing its button at the same time." width="300px" height="200px">

Compared with others, this handle is smaller and less comfortable to hold. While it fits okay in our small hands, it cannot ensure a stable, secure grip due to its slippery surface. 

### 8.0 - Cleanability

Removing all the food tailings from the blades’ backsides was pretty frustrating. Due to the restricted space between the blade and its guard, we couldn’t get our fingers in for scrubbing.
