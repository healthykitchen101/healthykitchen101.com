Overall Score: **7.4**

*   Design (25%) - **8.3**/10
    
*   Usability (15%) - **7.3**/10
    

The KOIOS Bullet is a bargain if you’re willing to compromise on the heavy-duty side of performance. We tested it with multiple recipes, and it was able to handle everything except for crushing ice cubes. Its ability to process leafy greens was just average, but the frozen fruit smoothies and protein shakes it produced were among the smoothest.

Plus, while most personal blenders around this price mainly concentrate on smoothie- and milkshake-making capability, the KOIOS also wants you to further remember its thoughtful design, generous accessory package, and the fact that it can even be used to grind dry ingredients. 

In conclusion, if you want an [affordable blender](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/) that will allow for ease of daily whole-food consumption, this KOIOS may be the hands-down favorite.

**Things We Like**

*   Competitive price tag 
*   Extra extractor blade for dry blending 
*   Powerful motor allows for a wide range of tasks 
*   Two blending cups are included 
*   Intuitive to use 
*   The blades can be removed from the base for thorough cleaning

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   No option for hands-free operation

After testing the 850-watt KOIOS Bullet in our lab, we can honestly say this is one of the [best mid-range personal blenders](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/personal-blenders/) you can buy. It blends well and provides consistent performance for a price that most people can afford. Although it might not have everything you want, it makes for a simple and effective blending solution. Worried about its reliability? Check out our hands-on testing.

Performance: Above-Average
--------------------------

performance Scores: **7.1**

*   Protein Shake (40%) - **9.2**/10
    
*   Frozen Fruit Smoothie (30%) - **8.0**/10
    
*   Fibrous Greens (20%) - **5.0**/10
    
*   Crushed Ice Cubes (10%) - **0**/10
    

The KOIOS Bullet did relatively well in three out of our four tests. It couldn’t power through ice cubes in the final round, but that didn’t worry us — the same is true for most mid-range blenders. The blended fruity drinks were above average. However, the fibrous greens should be blended longer than our 20-second time limit if you want decent results.

### Protein Shake

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6m02tn30010yv88cslohbsw.jpg" alt="KOIOS 850W Bullet Protein Shake Video" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6m04brb0011yv884g8l498x.jpg" alt="A batch of protein shake packed with dried blueberries, oatmeal, and almonds prepared by the KOIOS Bullet Personal Blender is checked for smoothness by being drained through a stainless steel mesh strainer, with a smartphone displaying the total blending time (56 seconds) next to it. " width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6lw45li000ryv88bk7i6hjx.jpg" alt="A couple of unblended almond chunks of the KOIOS Bullet being scooped from the mesh strainer with a stainless steel spoon." width="300px" height="200px">

Blending Time: 56 secs

Result: Smooth

The KOIOS’s blade has a rotation speed that is fairly quick for the class so it shouldn’t be surprising that this blender can make a good breakfast or post-workout milkshake in a matter of seconds. Not to mention its high-powered motor and more-than-average number of blade prongs (more prongs means more food contact, and results in faster results).

In this test, it took less than 1 minute to break down and combine all the ingredients, which was faster than most. The powerful motor couldn’t quite remove all lumps from the protein shake, but only a few chunks remained unblended, so our drink was still pleasant to drink. Moreover, the residual solids didn’t affect the tasting experience much — they were so tiny that they didn’t bother us at all. If you want smoother results, consider the [NutriBullet](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/nutribullet/nutribullet-900-watt-pro/) or the [Ninja Fit](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/ninja/ninja-qb3001ss-fit/), though.

### Frozen Fruit Smoothie

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6lzxc7y000xyv881xa2avyr.jpg" alt="KOIOS 850W Frozen Fruit Smoothie Video" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6lzy2k0000yyv88b2hy1f0n.jpg" alt="To check for solid chunks, after finishing blending, the fruity smoothie made by the KOIOS Bullet single-serve blender is spread throughout a white paper with a smartphone displaying the total blending time ( 1 minute and 20 seconds) next to it." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6lzyk5i000zyv888w8zfg8j.jpg" alt="A spoon of fruity smoothie packed with blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, and mango made by the KOIOS Bullet Blender." width="300px" height="200px">

Blending Time: 1 min 20 seconds

Result: Silky Smooth

The KOIOS Bullet brought all the ingredients together for a great-tasting smoothie in one minute and twenty seconds. Of all the similarly-priced blenders we tested, it was the only one that could liquify frozen ingredients that quickly. Most were 20-40 seconds slower, such as the [Black+Decker](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/black-decker/black-decker-fusionblade/), but that can make a difference; frozen foods thaw quickly at room temperature, so the longer you blend, the more your smoothie will be diluted. 

Simply put, the quicker performance of the KOIOS made for a thicker and more ice-cream-like smoothie. Chilly and fresh enough to quench our thirst, it also retained the texture that people look for in frozen fruit smoothies.

### Fibrous Greens

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6m06y8q0012yv88dci02sm2.jpg" alt="KOIOS 850W Fibrous Greens Video" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6m07p3w0013yv880figgo0g.jpg" alt="A glass of water with fibrous greens pulp produced by the KOIOS Bullet Single-Serve Blender." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6lxbjeb000wyv88csrldj0f.jpg" alt="A glass of water with fibrous green pulp produced by the KOIOS Bullet Personal Blender sinking from its top to bottom." width="300px" height="200px">

Blending Time: 20 seconds

Result: Very Coarse

We evaluated how well this blender handled fiber by blending kale, celery, spinach, and water for 20 seconds. The mixture came out grainy with a substantial amount of partially blended particles. Then, we drained it through a mesh strainer and examined the pulp. It looked like green sand with a moderately coarse consistency. We didn't taste the mixture prior to draining, but this coarseness, together with the volume of pulp, meant this blender failed to extract most of the flavor from the greens. 

We can’t say for sure if more blending time would improve the final result, but can conclusively say that 20 seconds worth of blending is not enough. By comparison, the Ninja Fit did the same job much better, leaving behind a significantly smaller amount of visible flakes. 

Our conclusion is that the KOIOS is just mediocre for blending leafy veggies. If you want to avoid leafy chunks in a quick high-fiber beverage, this is not the blender for you.

### Crushed Ice Cubes

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6m0nqrw0014yv88btnc5f63.jpg" alt="KOIOS 850W Crushed Ice Video" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6ufk4ua000i55883roihk7p.jpg" alt="A black tray of crushed ice produced by the KOIOS Personal Blender being on a table." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6ufkfrw000j55885s3h8uns.jpg" alt="The amount of unblended ice cubes (4.61 oz) of the KOIOS Bullet single-serve blender displayed on a scale’s screen." width="300px" height="200px">

Ice Fineness: Coarse

Unblended Ice: 77% of 6 oz

In this test, its performance was lackluster. The machine itself is incapable of crushing ice cubes. In fact, attempting to do so is not a good idea; the heavy-duty task can take a toll on your device and impair its performance in more ordinary blends.

Design: Worth the Price
-----------------------

design Scores: **8.3**

*   Build Quality (60%) - **8.0**/10
    
*   Blades (20%) - **7.5**/10
    
*   Blending Cup (20%) - **10**/10
    

The KOIOS Bullet comes standard with a compact motor base and stainless steel blades. It features only one speed setting, which is not unusual for this type of machine. Sleek and shiny looking, it has a cute, distinctive personality you won’t find in many rival personal blenders. Unfortunately, its motor base has some poor-quality inner components — we expect better even at this price point.

### In the Box

### Dimension

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clfi1x65q0009le88ht7cez2y.jpg" alt="Koios Pro 850W Bullet Personal Blender standing on a gray table, with the length of its motor base being noted to the side as 7.2 inches, and the total length and width of the unit as 12.2 inches and 5.5 inches, respectively." width="300px" height="200px">

Height: 12.2" (31.0 cm)

Width: 5.5" (14.0 cm)

Weight: 2.9 lbs (1.3 kg)

The KOIOS Bullet’s dimensions are about as standard as they come. At 12 inches tall by 5.5 inches wide, it is a typical size for a personal blender and can easily tuck away in your cabinet. Mobility is also very practical thanks to its compact form.

### 8.0 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6lm4vge000hyv888o0sbotc.jpg" alt="The motor base and blending cup of the KOIOS Bullet single-serve blender lying side by side on a gray table. " width="300px" height="200px">

Build quality is moderate, with a body mostly made of plastic. The stainless steel blades look promising in terms of durability and capability while the motor base is rather flimsy. However, despite that, this blender stands very firmly during operation. It doesn’t jump around while handling solid foods like most mid-range counterparts such as the [Magic Bullet](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/magic-bullet/magic-bullet-11-piece-set/). 

We like the metal surface on the front of the motor base. It gives our blender a more attractive appearance and better quality feel. After a couple of months in the lab, this surface still retains its original shine — even after the occasional cleaning with a metal scouring pad.

### 7.5 - Blades

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6lqbhle000myv889dqpa7a5.jpg" alt="A close-up of the flat blade assembly featuring 2 prongs of the KOIOS Bullet personal blender." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6lpkt3u000lyv88bog7gxl6.jpg" alt="A close-up of the blade assembly featuring 4 prongs of the KOIOS Bullet personal blender." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Stainless Steel

Type: Flat and Cross

Blade Count: (Flat) 2 blades, (Cross) 4 blades

Removable: Yes

Dishwasher Safe: No

The KOIOS Bullet comes with two extractor blades: one is flat and the other shaped like a cross. 

The flat blade has two dull prongs tilted slightly upwards and is only compatible with the short blending cup. We haven’t performed any tests on it, but believe this add-on will be handy for grinding hard ingredients like coffee beans, raw nuts, and whole grains. The blender’s mighty motor and consistent performance suggest it should be able to handle such ingredients.

Most of your blended treats will be best served by the cross blade. With six sharp prongs, it contacts more food at any given moment, resulting in finer outcomes and faster blending times. That being said, it looks less sturdy than some models (particularly the Ninja Fit). More prongs also means you’ll have more nooks and crannies to weave in and out of when it comes to cleaning.

### Motor Base

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6lp7var000jyv88epvq5w7d.jpg" alt="The motor base of the KOIOS Bullet personal blender standing on a white table.

Rated Voltage: 120 V

Rated Power: 850 Watt

Working Time: ≤ 1 minute

Protection: No

Weight: 2.4 lbs (1.1 kg)

Cord Length: 4.1 ft (1.2 m)

Extra Feature: suction feet, ventilation holes

The main housing of the KOIOS Bullet is made from medium-grade plastic, except for the front surface. It is a little smaller than other personal blenders, but could surprisingly tackle our tests without slipping or rocking around on the counter thanks to the four rubber feet at the bottom. 

Most models around this price cannot run continuously for more than one minute because the motor can overheat. The KOIOS Bullet is not an exception despite the fact that it’s equipped with many ventilation holes for better heat dissipation. If your drinks demand a longer blending time, make sure you let your machine cool down for 20-30 seconds after each 1-minute interval.

### 10 - Blending Cup

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9mejshs000mvu88cwiv921r.jpg" alt="Three blending cups of the KOIOS Bullet on a table, with dimension measurements written to the side.

" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic

Capacity: 10 oz, 17 oz, and 17 oz

Weight: 0.2 lb, 0.23 lb, and 0.34 lb

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Measurement: No

Suitable For: Small batches

Accessories: two spout lids, one flat-top lid, one sieve lid

In this set, there are two tall cups (17 oz) for blending watery mixtures and a short cup (10 oz) for grinding solid ingredients. The tall cups can be sealed tightly by either a flat-top lid or spout lid if you want to enjoy your drink on the go. And the short cup’s distinctive design looks lovely. It features a flat foot for increased stability and is particularly compatible with the sieve lid so you can use it as a shaker for ground spices like nutmeg, cinnamon, cocoa flour, ground coffee beans, or whatever seasonings you need.

### Speed and Controls

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clcfsdii10009me88c3sl31lw.jpg" alt="Someone is measuring the noise level of the KOIOS personal blender with the noise meter (96.9 dB)." width="300px" height="200px">

Activation: Push

Min Speed: N/A

Max Speed: 22,648 RPM

Presets: No

Noise Level: 97 dB

Digital Display: No

Pulse Mode: No

Like many personal blenders, the KOIOS offers only one speed option but doesn’t have buttons or any sort of controls. To blend, you simply press the cup down into the base, then hold it continuously until your smoothie is ready. The operating method is so simple that you may not need any practice. It’s easy to get comfortable with this blender.

Usability: Compromises is Unavoidable
-------------------------------------

usability Scores: **7.3**

*   Hands-Free Operation (60%) - **5.7**/10
    
*   Assembly (20%) - **10**/10
    
*   Cleanability (20%) - **9.5**/10
    

The KOIOS didn’t receive a higher usability score because it doesn’t allow for hands-free operation. However, it is still among the most user-friendly personal blenders out there on the merits of its straightforward operation, easy assembly, and effortless cleaning.

### 5.7 - Hands-Free Operation

You can’t walk away while the KOIOS Bullet does its job the way you might with a full-sized blender. It requires you to keep a hand on it the whole time. Plus, you may occasionally need to pause to remove the cup and give it a thorough shake.

Particularly in the smoothie test, frozen fruits got stuck under the blade and jammed it up. To even out the blend, we had to shake the cup after every 20 blending seconds. It gave us a good smoothie in 1 minute 20 seconds worth of runtime, so the process demanded four intervals total. Reviewers make a fuss about the repeated delays, but they’re a common occurrence among personal-size blenders. As long as you’re willing to spend an extra minute or two in the kitchen, it shouldn’t be a big deal.

### 10 - Assembly

Setting up this blender is a breeze. After twisting the blade assembly onto the cup, you’ll need to flip the cup over and place it securely onto the motor base, aligning the cup’s protrusions with the grooves inside the motor base. To start blending, gently push the cup down as long as you desire. Once finished, release the cup from the motor base and unscrew the blade assembly.

### 9.5 - Cleanability

Of all the blenders we tested, the KOIOS is the only one with a blade that can be separated from its plastic base. It goes without saying, this can be a life-saver, especially since the blade assembly is not dishwasher safe. 

To remove the blade attachment from the base, push the blade gear forward until it falls out. Note that these two pieces screw very tightly together through a white gasket ring so you'll have to apply a significant force, which can be a challenge if your hands are weak or in pain. 

Once you’ve separated the blade attachment, plastic base, and gasket ring, they can be washed off easily with soapy water. The only parts that are tricky to clean are the blade’s undersides, but the included small brush will make life easier on you. 

The other pieces, including the lids and blending cups, can be put in the dishwasher. For manual cleaning, just rinse them with soapy water.
