As single-serve units, personal blenders are particularly good for small batches of smoothies, protein shakes, sauces, and more. When it comes to prepping leaner, greener treats to take with you on the road, many also live up to the hype with their “grab and go” blending cups. From entry-level economy blenders to fancy, high-end ones, there is always something in the market for everyone—including sports enthusiasts and health-conscious folks who are after nutrient-rich drinks, certainly. 

How We Test
-----------

We first researched which functions of a personal blender are the most important to users and based on that, developed our test recipes. At present, we employ four different recipes/tests. They include:

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6ytywga0017bx88fzqsde12.jpg" alt="A batch of protein shake packed with dried blueberries, oatmeal, and almonds prepared by the Ninja BL480D is checked for smoothness by being drained through a stainless steel mesh strainer, with a smartphone displaying the total blending time (1 minute and 10 seconds) next to it. " width="360" height="240">

**Protein Shake**: Our protein shake combines protein powder, dried blueberries, oatmeal, almonds, and milk. We blend the ingredients until they're perfectly smooth, with a focus on ensuring the oatmeal is completely liquified to avoid a grainy texture.

During blending, we pause every **10-20 seconds** to check the texture. This gives us a real measure of performance. Scoring factors include blending time and blended results.

**Frozen Fruit Smoothie**: We blend milk, honey, yogurt, and four frozen fruits at the highest speed, pausing every **20 seconds** to shake the cup to ensure an even mix (if necessary). The primary focus is achieving a smooth consistency within a **2-minute** timeframe. Blenders that exceed this limit receive zero points. Speed is a scoring factor, with quality results as the main priority. 

**Fibrous Greens and Crushed Ice Cubes**: These tests reveal the blender’s capability in crushing ice and processing fibrous greens like spinach, kale, and celery. Such assessments matter in real-world kitchens as they help distinguish between all-around blenders and those that may fall short in handling a diverse range of ingredients. 

Beyond the blender’s performance, we also consider design and usability. The **design score** comprises three main aspects: blades , build quality, and blending cup. Meanwhile, the **usability rating** assesses the blender’s hands-free operation feature, assembly, and cleanability.

How We Picked
-------------

Recommendations are based upon the resulting scores of our testing procedures. We take into account the specialized strengths of a product, the situation it’s best suited for, or the personal circumstances it is likely to best match.

Our Top Picks
-------------

Without further ado, let’s move on to our best personal blenders list. It will cover some of the most important characteristics of each unit so as to help you decide which one is right for you.

1\. Best Overall: NutriBullet Pro Personal Blender

*   Easy to assemble and use.
*   Durable stainless steel blades power through solid ingredients.
*   BPA-free cups are sturdy and dishwasher-friendly.
*   Offers convenient hands-free operation.
*   Stable motor base.

*   Cleaning blade undersides can be challenging.

In a more compact design, the NutriBullet Pro encapsulates the power and efficiency typically found in full-sized countertop models. If you want to prepare a balanced meal with perfect nutrition, this blender deserves a spot on your countertop.

Packing a 900-watt motor, the NutriBullet Pro passed all of the hands-on testing with flying colors. Not only did it whip up **velvety protein shakes** and **lush frozen smoothies** in under a minute, but it also mastered the tough challenge of **finely blending leafy greens** within only 20 seconds. Its capability to crush ice was also nothing short of perfection—within just 40 seconds, it processed nearly 6 ounces of ice into a **fluffy texture**, a result that no other blender we tested could match. 

More impressively, there was **never a need to halt operations** to shake or stir the contents. The NutriBullet autonomously addressed any blockages, ensuring consistent blending without manual intervention. 

Beyonds performance, the NutriBullet’s build quality and user-friendliness also put it a notch above its rivals. Its durable construction boasts a **scratch-resistant finish**, and the precision of component assembly underscores meticulous craftsmanship. Given its intuitive operation, tasks like cleaning and assembly become nearly effortless. Indeed, it's one of **the most user-friendly blender**s we've experienced.

2\. Runner-Up: Ninja Fit QB3001SS Personal Blender

*   Excellent for blending fibrous, frozen, or tough ingredients.
*   User-friendly design; simple to use, assemble, and clean.
*   Precision-engineered, sharp four-pronged blade.
*   High-quality yet affordable.
*   Delivers consistently smooth outcomes.

*   Press-to-blend mechanism; not hands-free.
*   Occasional shaking needed for uniform blending.

When set against the NutriBullet’s more-classic-design, the Ninja Fit's sleek, tapered aesthetic exudes a sportier vibe. This makes it an instant hit among gym enthusiasts and those with an active lifestyle.

In terms of blending capabilities, however, both the NutriBullet and Ninja Fit offer competitive performances with minor distinctions. Despite its less-powered motor (700-watt), the Ninja Fit can take an array of ingredients, including oatmeal, almonds, and berries, churning out a **smooth, chunk-free shake,** in only 50 seconds. 

Moreover, it was among the few personal blenders that made **quick work of liquifying leafy veggies** and turning frozen fruits into **velvety smoothies** in **l**ess than one minute. The patented stainless steel blades are well designed for heavy-duty usage, so the machine itself also **didn’t have much difficulty crushing ice**. Although a minor fraction of the ice remained uncrushed, the texture of the pulverized ice was nearly on par with that of the NutriBullet Pro.

Our Ninja QB3001SS Fit has a straightforward design with a **press-to-blend mechanism**. This means you’ll have to hold the cup down to engage the motor; once you release, it stops. We love the simplicity, but still prefer models with hands-free options like the NutriBullet Pro. Plus, due to the cup’s slim, narrow profile, it may be hard to reach the bottom and clean all the inside areas unless you have a bottle brush. 

3\. Best for Smoothie: Ninja Nutri Auto-iQ Personal Blender

*   Versatile and fuss-free operation.
*   Excels at ice crushing and smoothie making.
*   Powerful 1000-watt motor.
*   Presets ensure consistent results.
*   Thoughtfully designed features.

*   Bulky motor base.
*   Loud operation.

The Ninja BN404 lives up to its premium pricing with a sturdy design and 1000-watt powerful motor. It also provides a sense of luxury with pre-programmed settings—an advanced touch that basic models like the uses of NutriBullet and Ninja Fit might find themselves craving.

Our hands-on tests highlighted its rapid blending abilities; from crafting sippable whole-food protein shakes to churning out nutrient-rich fibrous mixtures and ultra-smooth smoothies, **all achieved in under a minute**. Most impressive performance should be its ice-crushing test where it could turn 6 oz of whole ice cubes into a snow-like consistency **within just 14 seconds**— a feat neither the NutriBullet nor the Ninja Fit could match.

Note that the Ninja Nutri Pro is nearly **as bulky a full-size blender**, measuring 14.2 inches tall by 6.4 inches wide. At 5.4 pounds, it’s also heavier than most. This heft means your blender is very sturdy and will stand up to heavy use without rocking around on the counter, but it is also harder to move in and out of storage.

Nearest Competitions
--------------------

A few quick notes on other personal blenders we tested:

*   [KOIOS Pro](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/koios/koios-850w-bullet/): The KOIOS Bullet is an above-average personal blender. It can quickly make shakes and smoothies, especially with frozen fruit. Yet, it falls short on blending leafy greens and ice, often resulting in a coarse texture.
*   [BLACK+DECKER FusionBlade](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/black-decker/black-decker-fusionblade/): Despite sporting a low-powered motor (275-watt), all the results of this blender, except the crushed ice, came out more than acceptable. It wasn’t quite as good as the top picks, but was a solid and surprising competitor. 
*   [La Reveuse](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/la-reveuse/la-reveuse-personal-blender/): This is an affordably priced blender suited for specific blending tasks. Although it may not be the best for grinding hard items like raw nuts and dried fruits, for fresh ingredients, frozen smoothies, and green concoctions, it gets the job done. 
*   [BELLA Rocket](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/bella/bella-rocket-blender-bla13586/): We think most people will find the Oster’s power to be adequate for simple blends, like protein-packed shakes and icy fruit smoothies. For those seeking to thoroughly blend greens or achieve finely crushed ice, however, this blender may leave much to be desired. 

Factors to Consider
-------------------

When scouting for a personal blender, focus on these practical points to fit your active lifestyle:

*   **Motor Power**: Opt for 175-400 watts for soft ingredients, 400-700 watts for tougher tasks like crushing ice, or 700+ watts for heavy-duty blending.
*   **Speed Settings**: Simple one-touch operation is standard; models with pre-programmed settings offer more versatility but can be costlier.
*   **Size and Capacity**: Select a compact model with a 16-to-24-ounce cup for easy storage and portability.
*   **Cleaning**: Look for blenders with dishwasher-safe components for greater convenience. 
*   **Accessories**: Extra cups and tight-sealing lids are convenient; additional attachments like grinder cups are a bonus but may not replace specialized appliances.

FAQ
---

**Can a Personal Blender Crush Ice Cubes?**

The answer to this question tends to hinge on the blender’s power rating. Our hands-on testing indicates that a machine must have a 350-watt motor or greater to break down whole ice cubes. The design of its blending cup is important as well. If your cup is too narrow, there won’t be enough room for the ice to move around, causing the blades to get stuck and stop turning.

**How do I Clean a Personal Blender?**

Your blending cup may be top-rack dishwasher safe, but hand washing is still a better option. It’s easier on the materials, so your blender parts will keep their like-new appearance longer. Plus, it’s easy! To clean, you simply add soapy water or washing liquid to the cup, set the machine to run on the highest setting, and let the blades’ motion clean things for you. 

The motor base cannot be immersed in the water, so you’ll need to wipe it clean with a damp cloth.

**Can Food Be Added While a Personal Blender Is in Operation?**

Unlike full-sized blenders, a personal blender’s lid pulls double duty as the blade assembly. This means it must be screwed on and sealed before the blender can operate. If you want to add ingredients, you’ll need to pause your appliance and remove the cup from the base to unscrew its blade assembly.

**What Should I Do If the Blades Do Not Rotate?**

If this happens, it probably means there’s too much food in the cup or some chunks are too big or too hard, causing the blades to get jammed. At this point, you’ll need to stop your device, remove the cup from the base, and give it a good shake. If it still doesn’t work properly, you can remove some ingredients, pull them out to chop into smaller pieces, or add some liquid.
