A specialist tool ideal for preparing quick meals, your immersion blender will come in handy for small batches of soups, sauces, or baby food. Some high-powered blenders can even handle tougher tasks like processing raw nuts or frozen fruit without much trouble. Distinguished by their portable design and the ability to work with nearly any container, they can also be life-savers for chefs with limited kitchen space or those wanting to get rid of countertop clutter.

How We Test
-----------

In reviewing immersion blenders, we aimed to assess each unit’s performance in real-word tasks. After researching what traits users considered most important, we formulated test recipes to evaluate how these devices are commonly used. Each recipe is inspired by our own Chef Tuyet. They include:

*   **Puréed Hot Soup**: Using ingredients like carrots, pumpkins, onions, and celery, we designed this test to highlight each blender's capability in a simple but critical kitchen task. After cooking, we separated the vegetables from the broth and reheated the mixture to around 140°F prior to blending.  We used an identical 24-oz beaker for each blend, and ran the motor for 30 seconds. Blenders were then scored based on the smoothness of their output. 
*   **Frozen Fruit Smoothie**: Our test smoothie consists of a demanding blend: frozen fruits (mango and pineapple), kale, and water. Testing took place in a 24-oz beaker, with periodic texture assessments to determine when the blender achieved its optimal texture. The outcomes inform us about the expected duration and the smoothness of the final drink.

*   We also conducted **Mayonnaise, Almond Milk, and Whipped Egg-White** tests to further evaluate the versatility and efficiency of each blender across a variety of culinary tasks. None of these tests are as simple as they sound, though. We had to go through a lot of failures along the way to ensure that they were both practical and revelatory as evaluations. 

For the blender’s **design**, we meticulously inspect its blending shaft, build quality, blending beaker, and power cord. And beyond these technical details, we also prioritize user experience, evaluating the blender's **ease of use**, **blade assembly**, **handling**, and **cleanability**.

How Our Recommendations Are Made
--------------------------------

Recommendations are based upon the resulting scores of our testing procedures. We take into account the specialized strengths of each product type, the situation it’s best suited for, or the personal circumstances it is likely to best match.

Review of the Best Immersion Blenders 2024
------------------------------------------

Now that you know our thought process, let’s move on to the product summaries for the top-rated immersion blenders.

1\. Best Overall: Braun Multiquick 7 Hand Blender

*   Luxury vibe 
*   Lots of user-friendly features 
*   Sturdy construction 
*   Smooth and comfortable blending performances

*   Quiet pricey

Braun's reputation for quality is well-reflected in the MQ7035X, a model that stands out for its innovative design and upscale appearance. 

In our thorough testing, we found it to be **highly capable** in a variety of kitchen tasks. Its standout performance was evident in its smoothies; it easily blended **a diverse array of ingredients**, from frozen fruits to fibrous vegetables. It also performed impressively in soup puréeing, yielding a more refined texture than many of its peers.\[1327\] Braun Multiquick 7 Hand Blender Whipped Egg-Whites

This efficiency even extended to tasks requiring aeration. The blender’s whisk attachment proved to be highly effective, effortlessly whipping egg whites to stiff peaks. It also could emulsify egg yolk and oil into **a smooth, creamy mayonnaise** with ease.

A well-crafted product, this Braun’s appearance is characterized by a stainless steel blending shaft and a brushed metallic finish on the motor housing. In terms of usability, the blender’s design ensures a **comfortable blending experience**, offsetting its heft.  

It features an ergonomic, textured handle that promotes a secure grip, even when hands are wet or oily. The control button is strategically placed for convenient thumb access, allowing for effortless **one-handed operation** and minimizing blending mishaps.

2\. Upgrade Pick: Vitamix Immersion Blender

*   A great tool for recipes that involve fibrous or frozen food
*   4-pronged heavy-duty blade promotes speedy blends and consistent results
*   Intuitive interface makes it easy to switch between speed settings
*   Ergonomically-designed handle offers a secure grip
*   Blade Guard prevents scratching 
*   Stainless steel body ensures optimal durability

*   Expensive
*   Relatively heavy
*   There aren’t any extra accessories included

The Vitamix 5-speed ranks as one of the fastest, most efficient hand blenders we've tested, surpassing even the Braun MQ7035X in raw power and durability. It doesn’t earn our top recommendation, however, because of the steep price tag and the lack of additional accessories that could give it more capabilities.

\[17\] Vitamix Immersion Blender Soup Purée

Featuring a high-powered motor (625 watts), this blender can turn your foods into creamy, nutrient-dense **purees in 30 seconds**. Our tests yielded a refined hot soup, with a silky and consistent texture that would feel at home in **high-end restaurants**. For frozen fruit smoothies, it took just **1 minute** to complete the task. The resulting smoothie was **unparalleled**. Among all the blenders we tested, only the Vitamix was capable of delivering such a dense, creamy beverage with virtually no trace of unblended solids.  

However, without a whisk attachment, the Vitamix failed the egg-white whipping test. And although it can create a decent batch of mayonnaise, it takes a long time to do so and suction problems at the container's bottom make it less efficient than blenders with whisk attachments. Nonetheless, these limitations are most significant for those who need a multifunctional device that doubles as an aerating hand mixer.  

The Vitamix's interface is **user-friendly**, with two front buttons that cycle through 5 different speeds. Its solid build, consisting of high-quality stainless steel, minimizes wear and tear over time. Although it’s **a bit larger** than typical models, the blender is far from cumbersome. This largely comes down to its smooth-operating motor, a rubber-coated handle, and a well-balanced design.

3\. Best Immersion/Mixer Combo: Ninja Foodi Power Mixer System Blender

*   High-quality construction with upscale feel 
*   A generous set of included accessories 
*   A lot of user-friendly features 
*   Excels at a wide range of tasks

*   Larger-than-average blending wand’s head 
*   Rather heavy

The Ninja CI101 Foodi shines in kitchens where culinary creativity is a priority and space isn't a constraint. More than a blender, it's a comprehensive kitchen multi-tool that **handles everything** from pureeing to beating to dough kneading. However, if you have limited space or simpler cooking needs, its size and complexity may be unnecessary. 

Similar to the two previous products we reviewed, the Ninja impressed us with top-notch testing performances, churning out near-perfect results. In particular, it quickly created a **flawless puréed soup** in an astonishing 30 seconds. The final product was not just smooth but also impeccably uniform in texture. The blender also **fared well** in preparing frozen fruit smoothies, though the process took nearly three minutes. 

As a **professional-grade performer for aeration tasks**,  the Ninja CI101 Foodi also excelled at making mayonnaise and whipping egg whites. The inclusion of well-designed beaters leads us to believe that it might even be effective at preparing dough for baked goods. 

Design-wise, the blender exudes luxury with its sleek, modern build. Beyond its **intuitive controls** and **user-friendly attachments**, its blade guard, crafted from a non-metallic material, is a thoughtful feature. It addresses the common complaint of scratched pots and pans that stems from all-metal models like the Braun MQ7035X.

4\. Best Cordless: KitchenAid Cordless KHBBV53 Hand Blender

*   It can quick-charge in only 20 minutes
*   A beaker is included for greater convenience 
*   Ergonomically-designed handle provides secure grip
*   Simple battery charging 
*   The included pan guard will prevent damage to non-stick cookware.

*   Its performance is often inconsistent
*   Not as efficient as other similar blenders

The KitchenAid KHBBV53 produced a range of outcomes in its blending tests. It shined by creating a **near-flawless purée** and **a luscious frozen fruit smoothie**, even though it occasionally needed manual adjustments. For mayonnaise, it delivered a blend that, while not ultra-creamy, was sufficiently light and airy.

\[112\] The KitchenAid KHBBV53 Smoothie

However, when it came to non-dairy milk, the blender was not as good; it somehow incorporated an excessive amount of air into the liquid, resulting in an unusual foamy consistency. The foaminess could lead to messy overflows. Like the Vitamix 5-speed, it was also **incapable of properly beating egg whites**. 

Design-wise, we like the beauty and simplicity of the blender. Its controls are practical enough. You get multiple speed options through a very responsive trigger switch. The palm switch on the blender’s backside functions as a helpful safety mechanism.

Nearest Competitors
-------------------

A few quick notes on other immersion blenders we tested:

*   [Braun MultiQuick-5](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/braun/braun-multiquick-5-blender/): This blender is a strong performer, holding its own against some of the best blenders in our tests. Its design, though, leans towards the basic side. It might not catch the eye but it is certainly a good fit if you value pure performance over high-end features. 
*   [Cuisinart Smart Stick](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/cuisinart/cuisinart-csb-175/): This is a budget option that often struggles with hard ingredients like frozen fruits. However, it still provides consistent performance for lighter-duty tasks and offers good value for the money.
*   [KOIOS 4-in-1](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/koios/koios-4-in-1-immersion/): The blender is a valuable option if you are willing to compromise on heavy-duty performance. Its 400-watt motor lets you blend, puree, or grind with acceptable results while the solid body offers a reasonably comfortable, non-slip grip.

Things to Keep in Mind When Buying an Immersion Blender
-------------------------------------------------------

Here are a few key aspects that everyone should consider before buying an immersion blender:

*   **Motor Power:** Mid-range motors ranging from 200W to 600W are perfectly capable of handling tasks like whipping and blending. For heavy-duty tasks like ice crushing, aim for around 1,000W. 
*   **Price:** Immersion blenders under $50 are usually medium-quality and durable as long as they’re given proper care. Premium models range from $80-$200+, offering sturdier builds and additional accessories.
*   **Material:** Stainless steel blade shafts are durable and resistant to warping. Plastic shafts are liable to melt or warp with heat.
*   **Speed Controls:** Two speeds (Low and High) are usually sufficient. Multi-speed blenders provide more flexibility and control, but not everyone will consider them worth the added cost.
*   **Attachments:** While many people use immersion blenders for basic tasks, additional attachments like whisks or blending cups expand versatility. Some such accessories are included, while others must be purchased separately.
*   **Cleaning:** A blender that's easy to clean—i.e. one that has dishwasher-safe parts and a design that doesn’t trap food in crevices—is highly convenient and saves time.

FAQ
---

**1\. How do I Clean an Immersion Blender?**

To clean an immersion blender, first detach the blending wand from the motor. The motor should be wiped clean with a damp cloth and never immersed in water. While the blending wand might be dishwasher-safe, it will last longer if you always hand-wash it, instead. You can either rinse the wand under running water or fill a container with soapy water and briefly run the motor to let the blades self-clean.

**2\. Can an Immersion Blender Crush Ice?**

Immersion blenders are not typically designed to crush ice. While certain models may handle it, their results are usually less than perfect. Our experience suggests you really need a countertop blender to create smooth crushed ice.

**3\. Can I Make Whipped Egg Whites with an Immersion Blender?**

You can whip egg whites with an immersion blender if it has a whisk attachment. Standard blending shafts don't incorporate enough air to whip them up, generating a separated, cloudy liquid instead of a bubbly foam.

**4\. Can I Put an Immersion Blender in Hot Soup?**

Absolutely, yes. Hot soups are precisely what these machines are designed for. Hot, soupy mixtures present almost no challenge.
