A specialist tool ideal for preparing quick meals, your immersion blender will come in handy for small batches of soups, sauces, or baby food. Some high-powered blenders can even handle tougher tasks like processing raw nuts or frozen fruit without much trouble. Distinguished by their portable design and the ability to work with nearly any container, they can also be life-savers for chefs with limited kitchen space or those wanting to get rid of countertop clutter.

How We Test
-----------

In reviewing immersion blenders, we aimed to assess each unit’s performance in real-word tasks. After researching what traits users considered most important, we formulated test recipes to evaluate how these devices are commonly used. Each recipe is inspired by our own Chef Tuyet. They include:

*   **Puréed Hot Soup**: Using ingredients like carrots, pumpkins, onions, and celery, we designed this test to highlight each blender's capability in a simple but critical kitchen task. After cooking, we separated the vegetables from the broth and reheated the mixture to around 140°F prior to blending.  We used an identical 24-oz beaker for each blend, and ran the motor for 30 seconds. Blenders were then scored based on the smoothness of their output. 
*   **Frozen Fruit Smoothie**: Our test smoothie consists of a demanding blend: frozen fruits (mango and pineapple), kale, and water. Testing took place in a 24-oz beaker, with periodic texture assessments to determine when the blender achieved its optimal texture. The outcomes inform us about the expected duration and the smoothness of the final drink.

*   We also conducted **Mayonnaise, Almond Milk, and Whipped Egg-White** tests to further evaluate the versatility and efficiency of each blender across a variety of culinary tasks. None of these tests are as simple as they sound, though. We had to go through a lot of failures along the way to ensure that they were both practical and revelatory as evaluations. 

For the blender’s **design**, we meticulously inspect its blending shaft, build quality, blending beaker, and power cord. And beyond these technical details, we also prioritize user experience, evaluating the blender's **ease of use**, **blade assembly**, **handling**, and **cleanability**.

How Our Recommendations Are Made
--------------------------------

Recommendations are based upon the resulting scores of our testing procedures. We take into account the specialized strengths of each product type, the situation it’s best suited for, or the personal circumstances it is likely to best match.

Our Top Picks
-------------

Now that you know our thought process behind the testing procedure, let’s move on to the product summaries for the top-rated immersion blenders.

1\. Best Overall: Braun MultiQuick 5 Immersion Blender

*   Consistent performance with minimal splashing
*   Nearly as efficient as the higher-priced Vitamix 
*   Ergonomically-designed handle ensures a confident grip
*   Doesn’t get hot even under heavy-duty use
*   A generous set of accessories means greater versatility

*   The metal wand and whisk may damage non-stick coatings

Among the blenders we tested, both the Braun MultiQuick-5 and Vitamix 5-speed  emerged as top contenders with matching performance scores. However, the Braun MultiQuick-5 edged ahead as our top pick because of its budget-friendly appeal and the added versatility from its whisk attachment.

\[4\] The Braun MutiQuick-5 Smoothie Result

In the pureéd soup test, particularly, this blender delivered us with a batch of **smooth and creamy soup within only 30 seconds**. Although a minor amount of residuals were observed post-straining, they barely impacted the rich mouthfeel that the soup offered. Similarly, a **near-perfect frozen fruit smoothie** was achieved, marred only by tiny, almost imperceptible mango chunks, all in just a minute.

We also used the whisk attachment to emulsify mayonnaise and, in **less than 2 minutes**, we surprisingly found the sauce it produced was the best. It had a creamy, velvety texture, with a richness that was neither too dense nor too light. This addition also allowed the blender to double as a mixer, easily whipping large batches of egg-whites to stiff peaks. 

Design-wise, the blender boasts anti-stick surfaces, ergonomically-designed handle, and moderate durability. However, both the buttons demand a relatively high pressing pressure to activate. Plus, care should be taken as its stainless steel components might damage non-stick cookware.

2\. Upgrade Pick: Vitamix Immersion Blender

*   A great tool for recipes that involve fibrous or frozen food
*   4-pronged heavy-duty blade promotes speedy blends and consistent results
*   Intuitive interface makes it easy to switch between speed settings
*   Ergonomically-designed handle offers a secure grip
*   Blade Guard prevents scratching 
*   Stainless steel body ensures optimal durability

*   Expensive
*   Relatively heavy
*   There aren’t any extra accessories included

The Vitamix 5-speed is among the fastest, most efficient hand blenders we tested. Although it costs nearly twice as much as others, the premium price isn’t just for the brand name. 

\[17\] Vitamix Immersion Blender Soup Purée

Featuring a high-powered motor (625 watts), the blender can turn your foods into creamy, nutrient-dense purees in 30 seconds. Our tests yielded a refined hot soup, with a silky and consistent texture comparable to **high-end restaurants**. 

For frozen fruit smoothies, it took just 1 minute. The resultant **smoothie was unparalleled**. Among all the blenders we tested, only the Vitamix was capable of delivering such a dense, creamy beverage with virtually no trace of unblended solids.  

However, without a whisk attachment, the Vitamix struggles with tasks that need aeration. In our egg white test, it failed to form stiff peaks, leaving behind a mix of bubbles and liquid instead. 

Furthermore, although it can create mayonnaise, the extended blending time coupled with suction problems at the container's bottom make it less efficient compared to blenders equipped with a whisk attachment. 

The Vitamix's interface is user-friendly, with two front buttons for 5 different speeds. The whole blender is solidly constructed from stainless steel, ensuring reduced wear and tear. Despite its slightly larger dimensions at 17.5 inches tall and 3 inches wide, it's not unwieldy. Weighing 3.2 pounds, it's on the heavier side, but its ergonomic rubber-coated handle ensures comfortable and easy maneuvering. 

3\. Best Cordless: KitchenAid Cordless KHBBV53 Hand Blender

*   It can quick-charge in only 20 minutes
*   A beaker is included for greater convenience 
*   Ergonomically-designed handle provides secure grip
*   Simple battery charging 
*   The included pan guard will prevent damage to non-stick cookware.

*   Its performance is often inconsistent
*   Not as efficient as other similar blenders

The KitchenAid KHBBV53 produced a range of outcomes in its blending tests. It shined in creating a near-flawless purée and a luscious frozen fruit smoothie, even though it occasionally needed manual adjustments. For mayonnaise, it delivered a blend that, while not ultra-creamy, was sufficiently light and airy.

However, when it came to non-dairy milk, the blender was not as good; it somehow incorporated an excessive amount of air to the liquid, resulting in a foamy consistency. Not to mention that this foaminess could lead to messy overflows. Like the Vitamix 5-speed, it was also incapable of beating egg whites to a stiff peak. 

Design-wise, we like the beauty and simplicity of the blender. Its controls are practical enough. You can get multiple speed options through a trigger switch which is extremely responsive. The palm switch on the blender’s backside functions as a helpful safety mechanism. 

Nearest Competitors

A few quick notes on other immersion blenders we tested:

*   [Braun MultiQuick-5](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/braun/braun-multiquick-5-blender/): This blender is a strong performer, holding its own against some of the best blenders in our tests. Its design, though, leans towards the basic side. It might not catch the eye but it is certainly a good fit if you value pure performance over high-end features. 
*   [Cuisinart Smart Stick](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/cuisinart/cuisinart-csb-175/): This is a budget option that often struggles with hard ingredients like frozen fruits. However, it still provides consistent performance for lighter-duty tasks and offers good value for the money.
*   [KOIOS 4-in-1](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/koios/koios-4-in-1-immersion/): The blender is a valuable option if you are willing to compromise on heavy-duty performance. Its 400-watt motor lets you blend, puree, or grind with acceptable results while the solid body offers a reasonably comfortable, non-slip grip.

Factors to Consider
-------------------

Here are a few key aspects that everyone should consider before buying an immersion blender:

*   **Motor Power**: Basic tasks like whipping and blending are efficiently handled by motors ranging from 200W- 600W . For heavy-duty tasks like ice crushing, aim for around 1,000W. 
*   **Price**: Immersion blenders under $50 are usually medium-quality and durable with proper care. Premium models range from $80-$200+, offering sturdier builds and added accessories.
*   **Material**: Stainless steel blade shafts are durable and resistant to warping, outlasting plastic ones which might melt or warp with heat.
*   **Speed Controls**: Two speeds (Low and High) are usually sufficient, but multi-speed blenders, though pricier, provide more flexibility and control.

FAQ
---

**1\. How do I Clean an Immersion Blender?**

To clean an immersion blender, first detach the blending wand from the motor. The motor should be wiped with a damp cloth and never immersed in water. While the blending wand might be dishwasher-safe, it's best to hand wash it for longevity. You can either rinse the wand under running water or fill it with soapy water and briefly run the motor to let the blades self-clean. 

**2\. Can an Immersion Blender Crush Ice?**

Immersion blenders are not typically designed to crush ice. While certain models may handle it, they often don't yield perfectly smooth results. For optimal ice-crushing outcomes based on our hands-on testing, we recommend using countertop blenders.

**3\. Can I Make Whipped Egg Whites with an Immersion Blender?**

You can whip egg whites with an immersion blender if it has a whisk attachment. Standard blending shafts don't incorporate enough air, often resulting in a separated, cloudy liquid instead of a bubbly foam. 

**4\. Can I Put an Immersion Blender in Hot Soup?**

Absolutely, yes. Hot soups are pretty much exactly what these machines are designed for. Hot, soupy mixtures present almost no challenge.
