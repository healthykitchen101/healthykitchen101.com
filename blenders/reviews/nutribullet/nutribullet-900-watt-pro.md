The NutriBullet Pro is our [top-rated blender](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/) that will help those short on time and space enjoy the most nutrient-dense meals. A well-rounded model, it offers all the advantages that full-sized countertop blenders promise — heavy-duty power, consistent outcomes, and effortless performance — in a smaller, more compact footprint. Its high quality of built materials and overall construction also give it the edge over the competition.

Regarding testing results, it was the only one that got a maximum point in three out of four tests, outperforming all the competitors in preparing protein shakes, frozen fruit smoothies, and like-snow crushed ice. The mixture of fibrous greens it produced wasn’t perfect, but it was smoother than most, if not the second best.

There’s also plenty of other things that we love about the NutriBullet so all things considered, we can say this blender is an excellent choice for value.

**Things We Like**

*   It is very easy to assemble and use. 
*   Stainless steel extractor blades are tough enough to power through even solid ingredients like ice cubes.
*   BPA-free plastic cups are durable and dishwasher safe. 
*   Hands-free operation offers superior convenience 
*   Motor base is very stable.

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   It's difficult to clean the blades’ undersides.

The NutriBullet Pro sports a 900-watt motor. It is more powerful than most personal blenders, passing all of our tests with outstanding results. Given its impressive testing performance, we’re confident that hardly anything will offer this blender a challenge. It will be your quick and convenient way to transform any whole foods into nutrient-dense treats.

### Protein Shake

Blending Time: 40 secs

Result: Silky Smooth

The NutriBullet Pro is amazingly capable when it comes to preparing protein shakes. In this test, it was the fastest contender, mixing a silky-smooth workout drink in only 40 seconds. It blended well enough that we didn't need to shake the cup to promote contact between the food and blades. The blade spined extremely fast and together with the mighty motor, it allowed the blender to draw everything toward the blades and tear apart each at the same time without any struggle. You might notice there even wasn’t a time that food clinged to the sides of the cup.

There were also blenders that delivered the same result, such as the [Ninja Fit](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/ninja/ninja-qb3001ss-fit/), but they all demanded extra shaking or stirring to dislodge chunks trapped on or around the blades during the blending process. Efficiency aside, it’s apparent that your NutriBullet Pro will also outperform its rivals in terms of use ease.

### Frozen Fruit Smoothie

Blending Time: 50 seconds

Result: Silky Smooth

The NutriBullet completed our smoothie in less than a minute, and its results were unparalleled. Our smoothie came out exceptionally velvety. Although there were still tiny flecks of raspberry skin and strawberry seeds, this is a common occurrence when it comes to processing such ingredients. 

It’s worth noting here that no other personal blender we tested could produce such an ideal texture in the same time frame; some couldn’t even break down strawberries after a full minute. Again, this blender never demanded that we shake the cup or stir the contents, and we really couldn't be happier.

Aside from the high-speed rotation and powerful motor, we supposed the blade assembly is a factor creating this outstanding performance. Personal blenders typically feature a blade assembly with two or four prongs, but the NutriBullet is an exception. Made of first-grade stainless steel, its blade is a clear step above those of the competition, including even the pricey [Ninja Nutri Pro](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/ninja/ninja-bl480d-nutri/). It isn’t super sharp, but looks thicker than most and has up to six prongs. More prongs allows for more food contact at the time so the final drink will come out faster and finer.

### Fibrous Greens

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6ngqdnv00037088eqf37fe4.jpg" alt="NutriBullet 900-Watt Pro Fibrous Greens Video" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6ngqwlw0004708852ao0zdw.jpg" alt="A glass of water combined with fibrous greens pulp produced by the Nutribullet Pro Single-Serve Blender." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6ngrbhz000570883b8c24zn.jpg" alt="A glass of water with fibrous green pulp produced by the Nutribullet Pro 900-watt Personal Blender sinking from its top to bottom." width="300px" height="200px">

Blending Time: 20 seconds

Result: Fine

Liquifying high-fiber whole food like leafy veggies is always a challenging task for personal blenders, but the NutriBullet’s performance really made it stand out from the rest. 

It could break all the ingredients down into their finest state in only 20 seconds. We drained the completed drink through a mesh strainer and noticed it left behind very few leafy chunks. It could produce an even better result if we blended longer. 

Actually, we didn’t expect such good results so quickly. Most of the machines we tested turned out very coarse blends on this test, such as the [Magic Bullet](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/magic-bullet/magic-bullet-11-piece-set/).

### Crushed Ice Cubes

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6ngylnu00067088hqwt451f.jpg" alt="NutriBullet 900-Watt Pro Crushed Ice Cubes Video" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl6ngz3ad000770887au4d6dy.jpg" alt="A black tray of crushed ice produced by the Nutribullet Pro 900-watt Personal Blender being on a table.

Ice Fineness: Very Fine

Unblended Ice: 3% of 6 oz

The NutriBullet Pro is not only capable of crushing ice cubes, it excels at it! We tested a myriad of personal blenders, and so far haven't found a single machine that can crush ice as fluffy as this one. 

It finished the test in about 40 seconds. A couple of ice chunks still remained solid, but it didn’t look like the blades would be able to grab them. Nevertheless, this NutriBullet performed wonderfully and is very deserving of the top score.

Design: There’s Plenty to Like

design Scores: **9.7**

*   Blades (20%) - **10**/10
    
*   Blending Cup (20%) - **10**/10
    

The NutriBullet Pro is not revolutionary, but we love its simplicity and sturdiness. It delivers decent quality at an affordable price so you can blend with peace of mind for years. It also comes with several handy features that may interest you.

### Dimensions

Height: 14.7" (37.3 cm)

Width: 5.4" (13.7 cm)

Weight: 4.6 lbs (2.1 kg)

This blender comes at an ideal size — small, portable, and easily storable. Although it’s bigger than some single-serving blenders such as the Ninja Fit, it won’t take up too much space on your counter or in your cabinet.

### 9.5 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl5jg28gp000qy988hr3y7sc5.jpg" alt="The motor base and blending cup of the NutriBullet Pro single-serve blender lying side by side on a gray table." width="300px" height="200px">

This blender has a flawless finish. Its build quality is better than most rivals. It is also more pleasing to the eye and neither the motor base nor the blending cups scratch easily. For the most part, after a careful inspection, we all agreed the NutriBullet Pro was a better product than it looked at first glance.

### 10 - Blades

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl5jg2usk000ry9885h0s0qeh.jpg" alt="A close-up of the blade assembly featuring 6 prongs of the NutriBullet Pro personal blender." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl5jg39tv000sy988afpr3c8q.jpg" alt="The blade assembly featuring 6 prongs of the NutriBullet Pro personal blender being on a gray table." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Stainless Steel

Type: Cross

Blade Count: 6 blades

Removable: No

Dishwasher Safe: No

The blade is made of high-quality stainless steel and has 6 prongs. Solidly built, it is even more heavy-duty than it seems on paper. Still, the manufacturer recommends that it not be used for dry grinding or as a regular ice crusher since this may impair its efficiency and limit its lifespan.

### Motor Base

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clbd5jbxn000zbc884gx2hnli.jpg" alt="A close-up of the motor base of the 900-watt NutriBullet Pro personal blender." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clbd5j1ly000ybc88g2jb5kmv.jpg" alt="A close-up of the underside of the NutriBullet’s motor base." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clbd5jm9v0010bc885p75bnpo.jpg" alt="A close-up of the power plug, silicone feet, and cooling fan in the underside of the NutriBullet’s motor base." width="300px" height="200px">

Rated Voltage: 110 - 120 V

Rated Power: 900 Watt

Working Time: ≤ 1 minute

Protection: No

Weight: 3.7 lbs (1.7 kg)

Cord Length: 2.5 ft (0.8 m)

Extra Feature: Silicon feet

Peaking around 900 watts, the motor is powerful enough to handle just about any blending project. However, be aware that it cannot run longer than 1 minute at a stretch. If more time is needed, you should allow the motor to cool down for 20-30 seconds before continuing with the next 1-minute interval. This will help protect your machine from being permanently damaged. 

There are four silicone feet on the bottom of the base to keep it steady during operation. So far, ours hasn’t tried to bounce around on the counter even while tackling intensive tasks like crushing ice cubes. 

The rubber gasket built around the top is also very helpful. It’s meant to hold the cup tightly to the base, reducing the risk of leakage. On the other hand, we’re quite disappointed about the power cord. It is so short that it often got pulled from the outlet while we were using it.

### 10 - Blending Cup

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9me8e4t000kvu885rxg7713.jpg" alt="Two blending cup of the NutriBullet Pro 900-watt personal blender standing on a gray table, with the width of their top and bottom being noted to the side as 4.5 inches and 2.9, respectively, and the total length of the unit as 9.4 inches." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic

Capacity: 32.0 fl oz (946.4 ml)

Weight: 0.8 oz (23 g)

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Measurement: No

Suitable For: Small and medium batches

Accessories: 2 to-go lids, 2 cup rings, 2 handled rings

There are two identical blending cups with lids included. They both have a capacity of 32 oz and can be used interchangeably with the extractor blade. The to-go lids feature flip-top spouts and screw on tightly to seal well; we got no leakage even when we turned the cups upside-down. As a nice bonus, this blender also comes with removable lip rings, which make the cups easier to sip from directly.

### Speed and Controls

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clcfsniuo000dme881vehci6j.jpg" alt="Someone is measuring the noise level of the NutriBullet personal blender with the noise meter (97.4 dB)." width="300px" height="200px">

Activation: Twist and Push

Min Speed: N/A

Max Speed: 20,807 RPM

Presets: No

Noise Level: 97 dB

Digital Display: No

Pulse Mode: No

This blender has one speed and doesn’t need a control panel. Just attach the blending cup to the blade, place it onto the motor base, push it down to start the motor, and twist it to lock it in place. This makes this NutriBullet a great choice for people who like simplicity and don’t care about advanced settings. You can also simulate pulse mode by pressing and releasing the cup in short intervals.

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **9.7**

*   Hands-Free Operation (60%) - **10**/10
    
*   Assembly (20%) - **9.5**/10
    
*   Cleanability (20%) - **9.0**/10
    

The NutriBullet Pro perfectly fits our definition of a blender with good usability. Its straightforward working mechanism is a breeze to learn and use. It is also among the simplest to clean and assemble. So far, we don’t have any complaints about this little workhorse.

### 10 - Hands-Free Operation

We awarded this blender maximum points for this category. It takes little effort on your part to get the job done. 

While several personal blenders demand that we hold the cup in place throughout the operation in order to engage the motor, the NutriBullet Pro is more fun to use since you can take your hands off it once the cup is locked in place. 

And as mentioned earlier, it never needed extra shaking or stirring to dislodge chunks trapped under the blades; it created an even blend entirely on its own.

### 9.5 - Assembly

Assembly is the easiest part of using the NutriBullet Pro. Just screw the blade section onto your blending cup, turn it upside-down, and push it down onto the motor base to start blending. Twist clockwise to lock it in if you wish. To remove it, just twist counterclockwise and lift.

### 9.0 - Cleanability

Cleaning this blender is easy. Simply place the pieces (except for the motor base and extractor blade) on the top rack of the dishwasher or hand wash with soapy water and rinse well. 

Regarding the motor base, you can use a non-abrasive sponge or dish cloth dampened with soapy water. Wipe down exposed surfaces until clean. You may occasionally need a small brush to remove sticky debris from the white actuator tabs. 

The extractor blade, on the other hand, is a little tricker to clean. We found it’s almost impossible to reach the blade’s underside unless you use a straw-cleaning brush.
