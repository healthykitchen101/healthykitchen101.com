Among the mid-tier blenders we tested, the NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z emerged as the top performer. Although nut butter may not be its forte, this blender boasts notable power and an optimal rotation speed, allowing it to produce velvety smooth smoothies packed with fresh ingredients, frozen fruits, or leafy vegetables. Even the most challenging ingredients, like raw almonds, dried blueberries, oatmeal, and whole ice cubes, are no match for this machine. Consequently, the protein shake and crushed ice it produced were nothing short of impressive.

In terms of construction, our NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z strikes a balance between affordability and quality. It is built for its price point, with simple materials and components that look sleek and modern but not exactly luxurious. Most importantly, its blade assembly rivals the robustness and sophistication of Vitamix blenders to ensure consistent results across various blending tasks.

For those wishing for powerful blending operations without a hefty price tag, the NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z undoubtedly fits the bill, in conclusion.

**Things We Like**

*   Exceptional performance in creating smoothies from fresh or frozen fruits, protein shakes, and crushed ice
*   User-friendly, thanks to its minimalist design
*   Strikes a pleasing balance between price, functionality, and build quality
*   Comes with a generous amount of additional accessories

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Falls short in its performance when making butter
*   The blending container tends to detach from the motor during use, causing interruptions
*   The cleaning can be frustrating

The NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z Blender Combo comes in a range of color options, including dark gray, matte black, and matte white. Interestingly, the matte black and matte white models are priced the same, while the dark gray variant costs $10 less. Despite the price difference, all three models offer identical features, such as the same set of accessories, functions, and performance capabilities. You’ll notice we made the price-conscious decision and picked up the dark gray one.

This [high-performance blender](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/) boasts a robust 1200-watt motor and a generous 64-ounce blending container. It also comes with an extensive array of accessories, including a tamper, a spare blade assembly, and a pair of smaller cups.

The NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z isn’t great at making nut butter. In our test, it took significantly longer than average to turn 2 cups of almonds into a spreadable consistency. And even then, the final result was not as smooth as those produced by its faster rivals, like the [Oster Pro](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/oster/oster-pro-1200-blender/). 

However, this blender positively shined in all other areas of our testing by consistently delivering smooth and velvety results across various tasks, from preparing fresh or frozen fruit smoothies to protein shakes and crushing ice. Its powerful motor and sharp blades enable it to blend ingredients to a fine consistency with ease, producing top-notch results.

### Smoothie

Blending Time: 1 min

Result: Silky Smooth

The NutriBullet's combination of a mighty motor, high rotation speed, and innovative blade design allowed it to liquify all the ingredients with ease in just 1 minute. This is especially impressive considering the fibrous cellular structure of kale, which becomes increasingly difficult to break down once it’s cut into small bits. 

During our tests, we noticed that some blenders, such as the [Ninja BN701](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/ninja/ninja-professional-plus-bn701/), can only process leaves to a certain degree of fineness, regardless of the blending duration. Meanwhile, with the NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z, the outcome was notably different. Our smoothie came out exceptionally smooth with minimal fibrous remnants. 

Actually, the blender pulverized all the fruits, including apple, banana, and pineapple, in only 30 seconds of blending, and only needed the additional 30 seconds to deal with the remaining unblended kale. We were already satisfied with the texture of the smoothie at the 30-second mark—the tiny flakes of unblended kale would not affect your drinking experience. 

For those who often struggle with a hectic morning schedule and are looking for a fast and convenient breakfast solution, this NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z is clearly a perfect fit.

### Frozen Fruit Smoothie

Blending Time: 1 min 50 seconds

Result: Silky Smooth

Our frozen fruit smoothie test recipe contains frozen mangoes, pineapple, and strawberries. Each ingredient presents unique challenges. Mangoes possess a dense, fibrous texture that can be difficult to blend. Pineapples have a tough, fibrous core and contain the enzyme bromelain, which may lead to a foamy texture if not adequately blended. Finally, strawberries feature tiny seeds that can impact the final smoothness unless thoroughly processed. The challenge intensifies when these fruits are frozen, as the texture becomes even harder.

Fortunately, despite these hurdles, this NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z still managed to deliver a satisfying performance. While it wasn't the top performer in this test, it outperformed many of its mid-range counterparts, blending the ingredients on average twice as fast yet churning out smoother results. Even though some flakes of strawberry skin remained, their presence was minimal and did not compromise the overall quality of the drink.

In the end, the tamper was what gave the NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z an edge over its competitors, such as the [Black+Decker Crush Master](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/black-decker/black-decker-bl2010bg/). We noticed that consistently using the tamper to guide ingredients towards the blades sped up the blending process. Meanwhile, blenders without tampers usually needed more blending time, and some even left behind large, unprocessed chunks.

### Protein Shake

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clhpwpi0c000oow88gru3hh8z.jpg" alt="The NutriBullet motor base stands beside the container. Next to it, a metal mesh strainer filtered its protein shake while a smartphone displayed a blending time of 1 minute 30 second." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clhpwos2s000now886ysb0fkm.jpg" alt="A mesh strainer filters a protein shake made by the NutriBullet, retaining the unblended solids that fail to pass through." width="300px" height="200px">

Blending Time: 1 min 30 seconds

Result: Smooth

The NutriBullet impressed us once again in our protein shake test, taking on difficult ingredients like raw nuts and chewy dried berries without a struggle.  

Upon straining the shake, we did find some partially blended fruit pieces. Although we are confident that a longer blending time could address this, we chose to stick to our 1 minute 30 seconds blending benchmark for this evaluation. We reasoned that such minor inconsistencies would not be a significant concern for most users. All the oatmeal was fully liquefied, so it still came out creamy and satisfying. Meanwhile, the presence of fruit chunks was actually charming and enjoyable—a nice bit of added texture. 

Indeed, the NutriBullet’s results, blending speed, and performance were impressive enough to rival the premium [Vitamix E310](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/vitamix/vitamix-e310-explorian/). It even surpassed those produced by popular machines in the Ninja Auto IQ line-up, including the [Ninja AMZ](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/ninja/ninja-amz493brn-compact-kitchen-system/).

### Almond Butter

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clhpwr3kc000qow884h7c0ocy.jpg" alt="The NutriBullet is beside a white plate containing almond butter with a spatula nestled inside, and a smartphone revealing a blending time of 6 minutes." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clhpwqitt000pow88btbegm7x.jpg" alt="A sample of almond butter created with a NutriBullet blender, spread on a white paper." width="300px" height="200px">

Blending Time: 6 mins

Result: Coarse

The NutriBullet, like many full-sized blenders, employs a cyclonic action to blend ingredients. This means the blades create a vortex, pulling ingredients down towards them. This works well for most tasks, like making smoothies or blending nut milk, where the ingredients have a high moisture content and the blending time is relatively short.

However, making almond butter is a different process. It requires longer blending times and the roasted nuts are completely dry. When we started blending, the NutriBullet ground two cups of almonds into smaller pieces in just 30 seconds. But after that, the pieces started to stick to the sides of the container. They no longer moved in toward the blades, especially after they released oils and began to turn into a paste. 

We noticed oil release only in the regions near the blades. We paused the blender and attempted to push the ingredients towards the blades using a spatula, but to limited effect. It all demanded frequent pauses. 

In total, it took 6 minutes to create an acceptably smooth paste, although it was not as silky as the results from the [Vitamix 5200](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/vitamix/vitamix-5200/) or the Oster Pro. We unanimously decided to stop the test at the 6-minute mark since the machine had heated up considerably and even shut down automatically during blending (probably due to an overload). 

Indeed, six minutes is a long time and is hard to justify, especially given the high-powered 1200W motor. Many other machines with lower power outputs delivered better results in less than half the time. 

If your culinary adventure frequently involves making nut butter, this NutriBullet may not fit your needs.

### Crushed Ice

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clhpws6k5000row885ymddrcs.jpg" alt="The NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z blender is beside a black tray containing its crushed ice." width="300px" height="200px">

The NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z Ice Crushing Test

Ice Fineness: Very Fine

Unblended Ice: 0% of 12 oz

At the heart of the NutriBullet is a robust blade powered by a formidable 1200-watt motor. This powerful combination enables it to make quick work of ice. Impressively, it took a mere 30 seconds to turn 12 ounces of ice cubes into fresh snow. This contrasted starkly with other blenders, which left behind stubborn ice chunks that managed to evade the blades or simply failed to break the ice at all. 

With its superior ice-crushing prowess, the NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z stands out as a versatile kitchen companion, perfect for your icy smoothies, cocktails, and frozen desserts.

The NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z successfully merges aesthetics with functionality. Its sleek, contemporary look is complemented by a sturdy construction and a minimalist interface. Despite the powerful 1200W motor, which is typically associated with larger models, it also sits on a relatively compact footprint. It’s a refreshing deviation from the more common "bigger-is-stronger" design ethic. As a result, the blender not only delivers potent blending power but also conserves valuable kitchen space. So far, we haven’t had any serious complaints about its overall design or build quality, especially considering its price.

Height: 16.9" (42.9 cm)

Width: 6.8" (17.3 cm)

Weight: 7.1 lbs (3.2 kg)

Length: 6.8" (17.1 cm)

Compared with other blenders in its class, the NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z strikes a commendable balance between power and size. Measuring 16.9 inches high and 6.8 inches square, it is about the size of a standard coffee maker. While blenders with equivalent power are often bulkier and heavier, the more compact design and lighter weight truly set this blender apart. 

That being said, its height, akin to that of a two-liter water bottle, could pose a challenge if you have low-hanging kitchen cabinets.

### 9.0 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clhpwui7h000tow8806vqbz4t.jpg" alt="A close up of the NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z motor base and container" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clhpx9n0k0010ow88cf7g9152.jpg" alt="A close up of the NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z Motor Base" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clhpx0ewn000yow88aihs2y2c.jpg" alt="A close up of the NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z Motor Base" width="300px" height="200px">

The NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z presents a compelling blend of cost-efficiency and build quality. While it may not match the Vitamix's premium craftsmanship, it does hold its own when it comes to durability and reliability. Unlike budget alternatives such as Cuisinart, Black and Decker, and certain Ninja models that sacrifice build quality for affordability, the NutriBullet makes no such trade-off. With a body primarily composed of high-impact, BPA-free plastic—encompassing everything from the motor base to the containers and lids—it guarantees a stable and safe blending experience. Moreover, the high-grade stainless steel blades are designed to last far longer than the modest price tag suggests.

### 10 - Blades

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clhpwvqtl000uow888ir8cjiw.jpg" alt="A close up of the  NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z blender blades" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clhpwwf32000vow883hj40ft3.jpg" alt="A close up of the  NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z blender blades " width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clhpwy3ma000wow881dz505e7.jpg" alt="A close up of the  NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z blender easy-twist extractor blade assembly" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Stainless Steel

Type: Cross

Blade Count: (1) 6 sharp blades, (2) 4 sharp blades

Removable: No

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

We are truly impressed by the versatility of the NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z. It comes with two distinct blade assemblies—one meant for larger blends and one for smaller. 

The larger blade, featuring a unique six-pronged design, surpasses the standard configuration seen in many competing blenders, which typically only sport four or even just two prongs. This sophisticated design maximizes ingredient interaction, paving the way for quicker and more refined blending results. It’s intended to handle larger quantities, making it a perfect ally for concocting soups, smoothies, or meals for a group.

Conversely, the easy-twist extractor blade, which has only four prongs and pairs beautifully with the 32-oz cup, is a boon for small-batch preparations. This nifty setup essentially morphs the unit into a personal blender, ideal for whipping up individual servings of pre- or post-workout refreshments.

### Motor Base

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clhpwzwkc000xow88cq6adlox.jpg" alt="A close up of the NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z Motor Base" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clhpx9z9r0011ow88gwhb4tez.jpg" alt="A close up of the NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z Motor Base" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clhpxawtj0012ow882euj6yap.jpg" alt="A close up of the underside of the NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z’s motor base" width="300px" height="200px">

Rated Voltage: 120 Volts

Rated Power: 1200 Wattages

Working Time: ≤ 1 minute

Protection: Yes

Weight: 5.1 oz (145 g)

Cord Length: 2.6 ft (0.8 m)

The NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z's 1200-watt motor drives its remarkable performance. Its compact, round shape is thoughtfully designed to save precious countertop space while also allowing you to blend, chop, and mix an array of ingredients. 

The motor is rated to run for 1 minute. More than that and the motor may overheat and cause irreversible damage. If you need to blend longer, you’ll need to pause periodically to let it cool down. 

If the motor does exceed its capabilities, an automatic overload protection feature should engage. If it detects a potentially harmful scenario, such as an overfilled blender or extended operation beyond the recommended duration, it automatically shuts the motor down.

Beneath the base, four suction feet offer impressive gripping force. If your countertop is smooth, they should keep it in place. 

The 2.6-foot power cord can be considered fairly standard for many kitchen appliances. However, we still feel it is a little bit short. Nonetheless, if your kitchen has plenty of convenient outlets, it shouldn’t cause problems.

### Blending Container

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clhq2mffm0001xk88by1r073h.jpg" alt="Illustrated dimensions of the NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z blending cups showing their heights and diameters in inches.

" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic

Capacity: 64 oz, 32 oz, and 24 oz

Weight: (1) 2 lbs, (2) 0.6 lbs, and (3) 0.56 lbs

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Measurement: Yes

Suitable For: Small, Medium, and Large batches

This NutriBullet comes with a versatile set of pitchers, including one primary 64-oz blending container with measurement markings, a 32-oz cup, and a 24-oz cup with a handle. The 6-prong blade is built into the large pitcher while the 4-prong assembly can be fitted to the 32- or 24-oz cup as needed. You also get lids with drinking spouts for the two smaller cups.  

After undergoing a series of rigorous tests, the three pitchers still emerged sleek and shiny. Unlike other blenders we tested, they did not lose their luster or show signs of cloudiness. 

We did notice a few minor scratches on the 64-oz container. However, these were likely caused by our own handling during the cleaning process rather than any inherent flaw in the product. Either way, the scratches do not compromise its overall functionality. This minor imperfection is just a reminder of the importance of using gentle, non-abrasive cleaning techniques and tools.

### Lid

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clhpxe2rg0013ow887k50hruj.jpg" alt="A close-up of the Two-Part Lid of the NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clhpxer170014ow880f68f79q.jpg" alt="A close up of the main lid and vented lip cap of the  NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic

Closing Type: Friction

Features: Lid-plug

The blender's lid consists of two primary components: a larger section made from plastic, often referred to as the main lid, and a flexible lid plug (or vented lid cap ). These two parts complement one another to create a leak-proof and possibly even spill-proof seal. 

The main lid is specifically crafted to fit snugly onto the blending container, relying on friction to hold it in place. In contrast, the lid plug is designed for easy attachment and removal from the main lid so you can easily add ingredients mid-blend. The opening is also compatible with the unit’s tamper—there’s no need to pause the blend just to push ingredients around.

### 9.5 - Control Panel

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clhpxfulz0015ow884kcf92hi.jpg" alt="A close up of the NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z blender control panel " width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clk0x7hy1000xeg888n961lfb.jpg" alt="The NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z Min Speed" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clk0x8va6000yeg88ev0iexdp.jpg" alt="The NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z Max Speed" width="300px" height="200px">

Activation: Press-button

Min Speed: 14,479 RPM

Max Speed: 21,169 RPM

Presets: No

Digital Display: No

Built-in Timer: No

Pulse Mode: Yes

The control panel is designed to give users full control over their blending experience, with clear labels and touch-sensitive buttons. While you may notice it lacks a timer and digital display, it’s still very practical and user-friendly. 

The power button illuminates when pressed. While some users may find it a bit stiff to press, this is a minor drawback when weighed against the blender's overall efficiency.

There are three different speed options: Low, Medium, and High. The Low speed is designed for straightforward tasks such as processing cooked foods or mixing thin batters. Medium proves ideal for creating sauces, spreads, or blending powdered drinks. For more rigorous tasks, dense mixtures, or frozen fruits and vegetables, turn to the High speed setting. 

The blender also features the "Extract" button which triggers an automatic blending cycle that conveniently shuts off on its own. While it acts similarly to a preset function, it doesn't target any particular recipe, making it less valuable than typical blending presets. We found it to be more gimmicky than useful. Despite its promise for effortless, hands-free blending, the utility of this feature is debatable.

The “Pulse” button, on the other hand, is a commendable feature. It delivers short, powerful bursts, giving us the ability to process and chop food to achieve a precise texture.

### Extra Accessory: Tamper

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clhpxh6k50016ow886dy76jlj.jpg" alt="The NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z’s tamper is on a table" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Removable: Yes

We found that the NutriBullet’s tamper becomes crucial when blending thicker or heavier mixtures that resist suction by the blades. Without the tamper's assistance, frozen fruit smoothies would be much more challenging to make. 

We've noted, however, that the NutriBullet’s tamper isn’t as versatile as the Vitamix 5200’s. Its shape just doesn’t fit the container as well. The Vitamix's tamper matches the length of its slender, tapered container, meaning it can better reach ingredients inside. 

On the other hand, the NutriBullet's shorter, wider container doesn’t match as well with its short tamper. The tamper can’t reach some areas, so it’s not as helpful as it should be.

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **NaN**

The NutriBullet blender's control panel is very user-friendly. We could quickly grasp its workings without much effort. The broad, compact form of the container is also easy to clean. However, multiple grooves at its bottom can be a little frustrating to scrub. Food remnants may linger in these areas, potentially leading to odors if not cleaned thoroughly.

The assembly process is uncomplicated, though the lid can be tricky to remove or secure tightly. The lid’s handle is helpful in this regard. More critically, the container doesn’t lock securely to the motor base, so it can get unstable sometimes. We recommend continuously holding the handle of the container while you blend to avoid any accidental disconnections from the motor.

### 8.5 - Ease of Blend

Except on the almond butter test, the NutriBullet demonstrated an impressive ability to draw ingredients towards the blades, churning out optimized results without much manual intervention from us. We would have felt differently if we had to continually stop to tamp food down toward the blades. Since the lid is a pain to open and close, any such pause is a major inconvenience. 

We've also noticed another area that could use refinement: the locking mechanism that joins the container to the motor base. It isn't as secure as it should be, so it may occasionally pop free and cause the blender to stop.

### 7.0 - Noise Level

NutriBullet Blender Combo 1200w Noise Level Test

Max Level: 100.2 dB

We ran a noise test using ice cubes and water. This blender’s powerful motor put out 100.2 dB of sound. That is similar in intensity to the roar of a motorcycle engine, but the frequency isn’t as grating, so it’s not as though you have a Harley in the kitchen. Plus, the noise is only short-lived thanks to the blender’s rapid blending speed.

### 8.0 - Assembly

The NutriBullet's setup process consists of three straightforward steps. First, place the blending container onto the motor base. The handle should be oriented to the right of the control panel, never towards the back. Rotate it clockwise until it clicks into place. Though the lock is imperfect, it’s far better than no locking at all. 

Next, align the lid’s handle with the container’s and press the lid down into place. Then twist the lid plug into place—it’s threaded, so turn it clockwise until it’s fully seated. 

The NutriBullet loses some points in the assembly section. For one thing, the lid demands significant force to seat properly and to remove. This can give some users problems, especially those with limited hand strength. Additionally, as we mentioned before, the container doesn’t lock onto the base as tightly as it should. It can occasionally detach during operation.

### 8.0 - Cleanability

While all the NutriBullet’s components except the motor base are classified as dishwasher safe, we suggest a more delicate approach to maintain their pristine condition. Handwashing is less likely to cause scratches, discoloration, or other permanent damage. 

We cleaned the blending container and its blades by filling it with soapy water and running the blender at its highest speed. However, we found that the method was not entirely effective. A significant amount of residue still clung to the blades’ undersides and to the minute circular groove at the bottom of the container.  

To tackle this, we tried scrubbing the affected areas using a dish brush and sponge, which managed to remove some of the residue. However, it was only with a specialized brush, equipped with ultra-fine bristles, that we could effectively clean this groove and fully eliminate the stubborn food remains.
