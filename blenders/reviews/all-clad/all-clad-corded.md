Overall Verdict
---------------

Overall Score: **7.2**

*   Performance (50%) - **6.0**/10
    
*   Design (20%) - **9.1**/10
    
*   Usability (30%) - **8.0**/10
    

The All-Clad 10942212300 didn’t rank high in our ratings even when it was excellent at grinding soaked nuts and liquifying frozen fruits. This was because it failed to complete the task of emulsifying mayonnaise where most other immersion blenders we tested could handle with ease. The lack of an extra whisk attachment meant it couldn’t whip egg white, either.

We also tested its ability to make soup and eventually found that it was just mediocre in this regard. If you’re after something that can purée your baby foods to perfection, the All-Clad may let you down.

In the end, we can say that this All-Clad may appeal to you with its rock-solid construction and excellent smoothie-making capability, but the upscale price, hefty weight, and problematic blending experience will make you think twice.

**Things We Like**

*   The heavy-duty motor is perfect for frozen fruit smoothies.
*   High-quality construction ensures great durability.
*   The handle is designed to be easy to grip and maneuver.

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   The price is upscale but there is not much in return for its efficiency. 
*   It's just average at making pureéd soup.
*   Uneven acceleration causes an unpleasant blending experience. 
*   The hefty weight may cause hand fatigue.

The All-Clad 10942212300 is a [heavy-duty immersion blender](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/immersion-blenders/) with a 600-watt motor and multiple speed options. It has a professional and premium feel you can't find in most rivals. Other stand-out features that add to its appeal include modern styling, solid construction, and a generous 2-year warranty.

Performance: Some Competitors Performed Better

We had high hopes for the All-Clad 10942212300 in terms of performance, but it didn't quite hit the mark. This isn't to label it a subpar blender; it can indeed handle specific tasks very well. However, there are numerous other [all-around blenders](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/) available at a significantly lower price point that might offer more value.

### Hot Soup Purée

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla6et4pq001k6s881gmdbadc.jpg" alt="All Clad 10942212300 Immersion Hot Soup Purée Test" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla6i1hpi001p6s8888t7bf8s.jpg" alt="Scooping a spoon of pureéd soup from a full batch in a plastic beaker made by the All-Clad immersion blender." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla3nkdim00146s888t0uepcj.jpg" alt="A batch of soup pureéd by the All-Clad stainless steel immersion blender is checked for smoothness by being drained through a stainless steel mesh strainer." width="300px" height="200px">

Pureeing Time: 30 seconds

Result: Slightly Chunky

Suction: Slight

The All-Clad’s strong motor pulverized carrots and pumpkins easily, but it fell short in handling leafy veggies. After 30 seconds of blending time, several chunks of celery remained quite intact because they got lodged in the blade guard’s holes. The blender somehow couldn't draw them toward the blades. Ultimately, the soup failed to reach the perfect texture. At this price point, we expected a restaurant-quality soup rather than this grainy one.

### Frozen Fruit Smoothie

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla6fq1tp001l6s8848uhggnf.jpg" alt="All Clad 10942212300 Immersion Smoothie Test" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla3nlbho00156s88bkyef92u.jpg" alt="A plastic beaker containing a batch of green smoothie whose parts are scooped with a stainless steel spoon is between the All-Clad’s motor body and a smartphone displaying the total blending time (1 minute and 13 seconds)." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla3nlj2100166s88asmi738d.jpg" alt="After finishing blending, the green smoothie made by the All-Clad blender was spread evenly throughout a white paper to check for solid chunks." width="300px" height="200px">

Blending Time: 1 min 13 secs

Result: Smooth

Suction: Slight

In this test, the All-Clad 10942212300 blended the thick mixture without struggle. It completed its task in about one minute, which was much faster than average. All the frozen fruits were broken down into the finest of bits. There were a smattering of kale flakes in the final smoothie, but that didn’t affect our taste buds.

### Mayonnaise

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla6g7s0x001m6s88d8bydglv.jpg" alt="All Clad 10942212300 Immersion Mayonnaise Test" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla3nmvbh00176s887okq61dr.jpg" alt="All Clad 10942212300 Immersion Blender Mayonnaise" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla3nnf0s00186s889bodh8wk.jpg" alt="Scooping a spoon of failed mayonnaise made by the All-Clad hand blender from its full batch in a plastic beaker which is standing between the All-Clad’s motor body and a smartphone displaying the total mixing time (2 minutes and 5 seconds). " width="300px" height="200px">

Emulsifying Time: N/A

Result: N/A

Suction: N/A

For this test, we tried to whisk together three egg yolks and 240ml oil using the blending wand. To avoid broken mayonnaise, we ran mostly at medium speeds and only sped up once the oil started emulsifying. Each blender is put through the same testing procedure. However, this was the only hand blender that couldn’t reach the emulsion stage. After about 2 minutes of operating, all we got was a jumbled mixture that looked more like broken eggs than an emulsion.

Technically, it’s hard to conclude whether or not the All-Clad can make mayonnaise in the real kitchen since there are many external factors that prevent the emulsion from forming. This also means that the emulsifying capability of this blender is still an open question.

### Almond Milk

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla6hc7aw001n6s8800n9cqnz.jpg" alt="All Clad 10942212300 Immersion Almond Milk Test" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla3no8b300196s88gdvw0m7k.jpg" alt="A white plate of almond pulp being between the All-Clad’s motor body and a smartphone displaying the total grinding time (1 minute)." width="300px" height="200px">

Grinding Time: 1 min

Result: Fine

Suction: Tight

Considering how evenly and easily it blended frozen fruits, we weren’t surprised that the All-Clad had no trouble pulverizing raw nuts. After the mixture reached our preferred consistency, we extracted the liquid using a nut milk bag. The pulp was finely ground, so the final drink looked creamy and very milk-like. It tasted rich and almondy, exactly as it should. The whole procedure lasted one minute, which was 50 seconds faster than the worst one, the [Chefman 6-in-1.](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/chefman/chefman-vegetable-6-in-1/)

### Whipped Egg-Whites

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla6hykrg001o6s8874mpcmqr.jpg" alt="All Clad 10942212300 Immersion Whipped Egg-Whites Test" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla3novps001a6s88f2k0b5k4.jpg" alt="All-Clad immersion blender review: a paper carton box, the All-Clad blending wand with its motor body attached, and a user’s manual lying side by side on a white table." width="300px" height="200px">

Beating Time: N/A

Result: N/A

Suction: N/A

Any whipping task will likely exceed your All-Clad’s capability, but that’s mainly because it doesn't include a whisk attachment. We haven’t tried a single hand blender that could whip egg whites using just the blending wand. More often than not, the whites never even reach the soft-peak stage. In the end, we were left with a cloudy liquid composed of two separate layers of bubble film and eggy water.

Design: Lots of Premium Features
--------------------------------

design Scores: **9.1**

*   Build Quality (60%) - **9.5**/10
    
*   Blending Shaft (30%) - **9.5**/10
    
*   Power cord (5%) - **10**/10
    
*   Beaker (5%) - **0**/10
    

Everything about the All-Clad 10942212300 is expensive, from packaging to engineering and design. There are some alternatives that share many of the same qualities, such as the [Vitamix 5-speed](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/vitamix/vitamix-immersion-blender/), but this All-Clad does look slightly tougher than the competition.

### In the Box

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla3nph1a001b6s8832py31q7.jpg" alt="All-Clad immersion blender review: a paper carton box, the All-Clad blending wand with its motor body attached, and a user’s manual lying side by side on a white table." width="300px" height="200px">

*   Motor body 
*   Blending shaft 
*   User manual

In the package, you will find a handheld motor section, blending wand, and owner’s manual.

### Dimensions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/claakltmu0001mn88gpzth286.jpg" alt="The All-Clad immersion blender standing on top of its blending shaft on a gray table, with the length of the blending shaft being noted to the side as 9.4 inches, and the total length of the unit as 17.5 inches." width="300px" height="200px">

Height: 17.5" (44.5 cm)

Width: 2.8" (7.1 cm)

Weight: 2.9 lbs (1.3 kg)

Shaft Length: 9.4" (23.9 cm)

With dimensions of 17.5 inches tall by 2.8 inches wide, this blender stands taller than most. At 2.9 pounds, it feels pretty heavy in the hand as well — quite the opposite of many other models. The hefty weight is a consequence of its all-stainless-steel construction that is meant to ensure optimal longevity, but we found several competitors, such as the [KitchenAid](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/kitchenaid/kitchenaid-khbbv53/), could be just as durable without the added heft.

### 9.5 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla3nq5qd001c6s889ks1czdv.jpg" alt=" A close-up of the build quality of the All-Clad’s motor body and immersion blending wand." width="300px" height="200px">

On the whole, the All-Clad 10942212300 is well-engineered. Its interior is quite refined while the exterior uses high-quality stainless steel. Hard plastics are still present in a few areas, but they look stately and are meant as highlights.

### Speed and Controls

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla3nqr2t001d6s886plfe4aa.jpg" alt="A close-up of the All-Clad front interface which features a Turbo button, a power button, and a speed dial on top." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla3nra1j001e6s880x106hb3.jpg" alt="A close-up of a speed dial on top of the All-Clad’s motor body." width="300px" height="200px">

Activation: Press-button & speed knob

Min Speed: 7,776 RPM

Max Speed: 12,768 RPM

Presets: No

Noise Level: 67 dB

Digital Display: No

Pulse Mode: Yes

Controls used for this blender’s operation include two press-buttons and a speed selection knob. The “TURBO” button will give you a quick burst of power. For more controlled acceleration or deceleration, use the power button and the knob. It may feel like you need an extra hand, though, if you’re constantly stabilizing the blending beaker on the table. Adjusting the All-Clad’s speed can take some practice.

### 9.5 - Blending Shaft

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla3ns4vl001f6s883ixja0cp.jpg" alt="A close-up of the stainless steel blade assembly sporting 2 prongs of the All-Clad stick blender. " width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Stainless steel

Type: Sharp Blade

Guard Material: Stainless steel

Blade Count: 2

Removable: Yes

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Constructed of hardened stainless steel**,** the 2-prong blade is super sharp and sturdy. Around it is a metal guard designed to minimize food splatter and head suction, but we don’t think this part is up to the task. Not to mention the fact that it will scratch the interior surfaces of your cookware if you don’t blend very carefully.

### Failed - Beaker

Material: N/A

Capacity: NaN fl oz (NaN ml)

Measurements: N/A

Weight: NaN oz (NaN g)

Height: NaN" (NaN cm)

Dishwasher Safe: N/A

This All-Clad doesn’t come with a blending container, but you can easily use any one you find that’s the right size.

### 10 - Power cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla3nsphy001g6s88cb0c3sjh.jpg" alt="The All-Clad Immersion Blender on a white table with its power cord that features a 2-prong plug rolled up next to it." width="300px" height="200px">

Cord Length: 5.1 ft (1.6 m)

Type: 2-prong plug

Detachable:  No

The power cord is long enough to reach any nearby outlet. It has a polarized plug, so it will only fit into the socket in one direction.

### Extra Accessories

Material: N/A

Dishwasher Safe: N/A

Removable: N/A

No additional attachments are included. If you want to use aftermarket attachments other than the standard blending shaft, make sure they’re purpose-built by All-Clad.

Usability: Not Bad, but Not Great Either.
-----------------------------------------

usability Scores: **8.0**

*   Ease of Use (60%) - **7.8**/10
    
*   Blade Assembly (10%) - **8.0**/10
    
*   Handling (20%) - **8.5**/10
    
*   Cleanability (10%) - **8.0**/10
    

The blender’s design is straightforward but it’s not as comfortable to use as it should be. Luckily, cleaning is a simple process since the blending wand is dishwasher safe. We still recommend hand washing, though, to keep it looking new for longer.

### 7.8 - Ease of Use

During our hands-on testing, we noticed this blender didn’t deliver its power as cleanly as we would prefer. The motor did not accelerate smoothly, causing hand fatigue and making our blending motion more difficult. Plus, the blades splashed food everywhere.

Due to its heavy weight, the All-Clad 10942212300 is a bit fatiguing to use for extended periods. It’s also quite cumbersome to maneuver, especially when you change speeds, since the blender suctions itself very tightly to the beaker. There may be a way to beat the suction without creating a mess, but we haven’t found it. 

The other inconvenience is that food gets lodged in the blade guard’s holes. You may need to pause repeatedly during the blending process to clear them.

### 8.0 - Blade Assembly

A simple twist will connect the main body to the blending shaft. But, again, the weight may make that job tricky if your hands are small or greasy.

### 8.5 - Handling

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla3nth5m001h6s883i1rgbc2.jpg" alt="Someone is holding the All-Clad’s handle and pressing its button at the same time. " width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla3nu7et001i6s88h1ur58k3.jpg" alt="Someone is holding the All-Clad’s handle with one hand and rotating the speed dial located on the top of the motor body at the same time with the other hand." width="300px" height="200px">

The handle is ergonomically designed to provide a comfortable grip. Not only that, but it also has a rubber grip which is particularly handy when you have sweaty or slippery hands.

### 8.0 - Cleanability

Cleaning this All-Clad is less of a hassle than most. You can wash it by hand easily or put the blending shaft in the dishwasher. The only things to be careful of are the blade’s backsides — it’s hard to reach under the blade, so a cleaning bottle brush is practically a necessity. As with any blender, the motor section cannot be immersed in water and should only be wiped down with a damp cloth.
