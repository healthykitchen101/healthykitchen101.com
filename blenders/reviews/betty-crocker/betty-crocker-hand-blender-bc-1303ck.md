*   Usability (30%) - **5.9**/10
    

The Betty Crocker’s performance is adequate for simple tasks such as puréeing soups, making nut milk, and concocting mayonnaise. Yet, its proficiency is tested and found wanting with the challenge of frozen fruit smoothies; the power of the motor is insufficient for achieving the desired creamy texture. Moreover, when it's a question of whipping efficiency, the blender is outpaced by competitors that boast whisk attachments. 

The blender’s build also leaves room for improvement. Its plastic components point to a design that prioritizes cost-saving over durability. And this was quickly proven to be a drawback, as evidenced by a broken part that emerged after our testing.

The Betty Crocker blender serves pretty well for regular, uncomplicated pureeing tasks, offering just the right amount of power for daily kitchen activities. Its limitations become evident, though, in scenarios requiring higher power. In comparison to other highered-powered models in its class, especially those with additional attachments like whisks, it also tends to lag in versatility and effectiveness. 

### Hot Soup Purée

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clq6e1pv30002vv888w3gd9ir.jpg" alt="Scooping a spoon of pureéd soup produced by the Betty Crocker from the plastic beaker to check its smoothness." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clq6e260y0003vv8884gndmi1.jpg" alt="A batch of soup pureéd by the Betty Crocker immersion blender is checked for smoothness by being drained through a stainless steel mesh strainer." width="300px" height="200px">

Pureeing Time: 30 seconds

Result: Slightly Chunky

Suction: Slightly

In a 30-second benchmark test for pureeing, the Betty Crocker immersion blender was used to process a soup consisting of pumpkin, carrot, and celery. The blender yielded a puree that was fairly smooth and on par with similar budget-friendly blenders. The puree came out visually homogeneous; however, upon straining, small, unprocessed pieces of the vegetables were still discernible. 

For the most part, we consider this result acceptable. It’s particularly sufficient for those who prefer a homestyle texture in their purees, such as in comforting soups or stews, or for preparing baby food where fineness is balanced with the need to minimize choking risks, rather than achieving a velvety restaurant-grade texture.

### Smoothie

Blending Time: 3 mins

Result: Very Coarse

Suction: Slightly

The test was conducted using kale, mango, and pineapple, all frozen, to challenge the Betty Crocker blender's capabilities. As the blender operated, the focus was on the transformation of the mixture's texture. The goal was to achieve a smoothie that was both smooth in texture and cold in temperature—hallmarks of a well-crafted frozen smoothie. However, after three minutes of blending, it became apparent that the smoothie had not reached a satisfactory level of smoothness. Pieces of fruit and kale remained noticeable, despite the blender’s considerable effort.

From this test, we conclude that the Betty Crocker blender **is definitely not the ideal tool** for creating smoothies from tough, frozen ingredients within a short time frame without compromising texture. For those seeking a consistently smooth and chilled smoothie, a higher-powered blender, such as the [Vitamix 5-speed](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/vitamix/vitamix-immersion-blender/) or the [Braun MultiQuick-5](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/braun/braun-multiquick-5-blender/), would likely be a better investment.

### Mayonnaise

Emulsifying Time: 2 min 15 secs

Result: Smooth

Suction: Slightly

After a blending time of 2 minutes and 15 seconds, the Betty Crocker produced mayonnaise that was both smooth to the touch and pleasing to the palate — a well-emulsified mixture that held together in creamy harmony.

However, when placed in the context of performance speed, the Betty Crocker takes its time, with a blending duration that stretches notably beyond the average of its high-speed competitors. In a fast-paced culinary environment, this longer duration could be seen as a drawback so despite the successful outcome, the blender did not score highly in this test.

### Almond Milk

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clq6e639j0008vv88arr50nqs.jpg" alt="A white plate of almond pulp and a bowl of milk produced by the Betty Crocker stick blender within 1 minute and 30 seconds." width="300px" height="200px">

Grinding Time: 1 min 30 secs

Result: Fine

Suction: Slightly

Our Betty Crocker completed this test in 1 minute and 30 seconds. This performance was on par with the average of other blenders in the same category. 

The almonds were ground to a fine consistency, as evidenced in our post-straining analysis. This fine grind infused the milk with a rich flavor, creamy texture, and the inherent nutrients of the almonds. Notably, the blending process had an additional effect: the blending shaft introduced a significant amount of air into the milk. This resulted in a progressively frothy top layer that became more pronounced as the blending continued, eventually leading to a spillover from the beaker. 

For users intending to use the Betty Crocker blender for similar liquid-based tasks, it is advisable to opt for a larger container. This would help prevent the frothy mixture from spilling over and creating a mess on the countertop.

### Whipped Egg-Whites

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clq6e7qd50009vv881gbyb9h1.jpg" alt="A digital timer shows 2:01 on a kitchen counter, with a beaker containing unsuccessfully beaten egg whites next to the Betty Crocker immersion blender. " width="300px" height="200px">

Beating Time: Failed

Result: Failed

Suction: Failed

In the test to assess Betty Crocker's ability to whip egg whites, the lack of a whisk attachment became a significant limitation. Utilizing the standard blending shaft, the blender struggled to introduce enough air into the egg whites. This resulted in a subpar outcome: the egg whites separated into a frothy top layer and a watery bottom layer, instead of forming a uniform, fluffy foam.

For even a low-cost kitchen appliance, consumers might not only expect but require a certain standard of durability and reliability that, based on some accounts, this blender does not consistently meet.  Among the blenders we've tested, Betty Crocker is considered one of the poorest in terms of build quality. Its overall construction, both internally and externally, is deemed cheap. Moreover, its aesthetic appeal diminishes quickly; the color and finish lose their vibrancy and sheen after only a few uses.

The Betty Crocker’s usability is hampered by its inefficient vortex creation and uncomfortable vibrations. The overall design also contributes to its limitations, as its ergonomics and weight distribution are not as conducive to comfortable handle as those of other blenders in the market.

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **5.9**

*   Ease of Use (60%) - **4.9**/10
    
*   Blade Assembly (10%) - **9.0**/10

*   Cleanability (10%) - **7.5**/10
    

The Betty Crocker’s usability is hampered by its inefficient vortex creation and uncomfortable vibrations. The overall design also contributes to its limitations, as its ergonomics and weight distribution are not as conducive to comfortable handle as those of other blenders in the market.

### 4.9 - Ease of Use

We grasped the functionality of the blender without much difficulty. However, the stiffness of its buttons, which required a firm press for activation, was uncomfortable and felt a bit cumbersome. The design of the blade housing effectively reduced suction against the beaker, enhancing the blender's manageability. Yet, we still encountered persistent spattering challenges every time we moved the blending shaft. This spattering issue seems to be linked to the blender's inefficient vortex creation; a poorly formed vortex can cause ingredients to be flung outwards, resulting in messy splashes. Additionally, the blender's poor ingredient intake frequently forced us to stop and manually adjust the contents, making the process both tedious and time-consuming.

### 9.0 - Blade Assembly

Assembling our blender was an effortless task. We easily aligned the blending wand with the motor body until it securely clicked in. Disassembling was just as simple and hassle-free: a quick counterclockwise rotation and then pulling it away from the body did the trick.

### 6.5 - Handling

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clq6egugy000ivv887e2f182k.jpg" alt="Someone is holding the Betty Crocker immersion blender." width="300px" height="200px">

The handle’s rigid form and lack of a cushioned grip contributed to rapid hand fatigue. The motor creates pronounced vibrations, especially when tackling dense, challenging ingredients. This, coupled with the unwelcoming stiffness of the controlling buttons, sharply highlights the ergonomic flaws of this Betty Crocker, making for a less than ideal blending experience.

### 7.5 - Cleanability

While the front surfaces of the blades were easily cleaned with a simple rinse under running water, the backside presented a challenge. Food particles tended to stick there, and the narrow gap between the blade and its guard made it impossible to reach these particles with fingers. We found that employing a straw-cleaning brush was necessary to effectively remove these persistent leftovers.
