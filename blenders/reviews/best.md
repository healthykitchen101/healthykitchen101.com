The versatile culinary appliances we call blenders come in many forms, each designed to serve a particular purpose. From immersion blenders made to blend soups directly in the pot to countertop varieties which excel in pulverizing frozen-fruit smoothies, you’re not short on options.

So, when you ask, "Which are the **best blenders**?" The answer isn't about a specific brand or model; it's about meeting your personal culinary needs. Are you a nutty sorcerer who wants to emulsify whole almonds into creamy nut butter? Or perhaps you're more the smoothie enthusiast on the hunt for a green [smoothie blender](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/smoothies/) that makes you forget you're drinking spinach? You might be a humble babysitter hunting for the ideal blender to turn wholesome fruits and vegetables into silky pureés for your little ones.

To bring you the ultimate guide, we put 37 models through their paces, subjecting each to a series of tests designed to uncover the true blending champions. With every whir, pulse, and blend, we uncovered their strengths, weaknesses, and everything in between.

How We Test
-----------

Our testing methods mimic everyday kitchen tasks. Though different blender types have unique testing criteria, consistency is maintained within each category for direct product comparisons.

**For** [**full-sized blenders**](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/tests/full-size/), tests focus on performance, durability, and usability in processing large volumes. 

*   **Smoothie**: We blend a mix of kale, apple, pineapple, banana, and milk. The test concludes either when a smooth, homogeneous texture is achieved, or upon reaching the 4-minute mark. The score factors in blending time and the final blended result. 
*   **Frozen Fruit Smoothie**: Our testing smoothie is a combination of mango, strawberry, pineapple, and plain milk. We blend at the highest speed or a "Frozen Smoothie" mode. The aim is to achieve an ice cream-like texture within a maximum of five minutes. Scoring evaluates blending time and result. 
*   Additional tests include **Almond Butter, Protein Shake** and **Crushed Ice Cubes** to offer insights into a blender's versatility, especially for those keen on homemade nut-based spreads, fitness beverages and icy concoctions.

In our design’s evaluation, we examine the blender’s blade strength, overall build quality, and the functionality of the control panel. We also consider hands-free blending, noise levels during operation, ease of assembly, and cleanability post-blend. 

For [**immersion blenders**](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/immersion-blenders/#how-we-test), we conducted standard tasks like Puréed Hot Soup, Frozen Fruit Smoothies, Mayonnaise, Almond Milk, and Whipped Egg-White.

[**Personal blenders**](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/personal-blenders/#how-we-test), on the other hand, were evaluated basing on their suitability for on-the-go lifestyles, with Protein Shakes, Frozen Fruit Smoothies, Fibrous Greens, and Crushed Ice Cubes tests.

How We Picked
-------------

Recommendations are based upon the testing results and their associated scores. We take into account the specialized strengths of a product, the situation it’s best suited for, and the personal circumstances where it will fit best. 

Our Top Picks
-------------

Besides a list of the best blenders, we’ll also describe the pros and cons of each unit we tested. Let’s take a look at our recommendations now:

1\. Best Overall: Vitamix 5200 Blender

*   A lot of user-friendly features.
*   Versatile speed settings.
*   Capable of blending non-stop for up to six minutes.
*   Rapid and potent acceleration.
*   Excellent for both hot and icy blending applications. 
*   Ideal for preparing family-sized batches. 
*   Longer-than-average 7-year warranty.

*   The container does not lock onto the base 
*   Average ice-crushing capability

Of all the blenders we tested, the Vitamix 5200’s perfection makes it stand out as a top-tier. It exemplifies the brand’s commitment to superior craftsmanship, impressing users with its remarkable durability, user-friendly design, and high-caliber performance. 

\[975\] Vitamix 5200 Blender Smoothie

Operating on approximately 1500 watts (2 horsepower), this blender reaches a remarkable speed of 23,122 RPM. Through our tests, the machine proved capable of handling nearly any task. Whether turning a challenging mix of leafy greens or rock-hard frozen fruits into **velvety smoothies** or crafting a **perfect protein shake** loaded with tough raw nuts, it consistently delivered outstanding results in just one minute.

More impressively, this performance was often 2-3 times faster than that of competitors. Its **60-second** transformation of almonds into a creamy butter stood out as well. 

While it did fall short in completely blending the full 12 oz of ice, the crushed ice it produced was still fine enough for most cocktails and slushies; it was just not as snow-like as you might desire.

The blender’s generous dimensions of 8.9 inches in width, 7.7 inches in length, and 17.4 inches in height might be bulky for some cupboards . We consider the bulk worthwhile, though, given the machine’s ample blending capacity. Clear labeling and intuitive controls make this blender very user-friendly. Assembling and disassembling the Vitamix 5200 is an effortless process. However, the clean-up may be a bit challenging for those with larger hands due to the narrow blending container. 

2\. Best Runner-Up: NutriBullet Blender Combo 1200 Watt

*   Exceptional performance in creating smoothies from fresh or frozen fruits, protein shakes, and crushed ice
*   User-friendly, thanks to its minimalist design
*   Great balance of price, function, and quality.
*   Generous accessory inclusion.

*   Underperforms with butters.
*   Container may detach during use.
*   Cleaning can be tedious.

Priced more modestly than our top pick, the NutriBullet ZNBF30500Z didn't falter in our tests. Its 1200-watt motor particularly excelled at blending green smoothies, taking just a minute to yield a **velvety blend** that broke down even fibrous kale. 

\[1004\] NutriBullet Blender Combo 1200w Frozen Fruit Smoothie 1

Frozen fruit smoothies and protein shake were another of its strong suits; from start to finish, the blender could manage smooth output in only less than **two minutes**. Its ice-crushing capacity even outshined the heavy-hitting Vitamix 5200 as it could turn 12 ounces of ice cubes into a fine **snow-like texture** within just **30 seconds**. 

Making almond butter, however, was a little bit challenging, requiring up to 6 minutes for a completion. Still, the pay-off of a preservative-free, homemade spread was worth the wait. 

In terms of build quality, NutriBullet defies the convention that affordability equals poor quality. The blender's **robust construction** employs high-impact, BPA-free plastic for the motor base, containers, and lids, ensuring longevity without sacrificing safety. 

On the downside, the blender’s container is occasionally **unstable** while blending, and its lid is hard to remove. Cleaning can also be a slight challenge due to grooves on the container.

3\. Best Small: Oster Pro 1200 Blender

*   Great value for the price
*   Intuitive button layout
*   Easy to clean and assemble
*   Perfect for green smoothies, almond butter, and crushed ice

*   Gimmicky control panel
*   Struggles with frozen fruit smoothies

In our testing, the Oster Pro revealed an unexpected quirk. One of its crowning achievements was ice-crushing, where it managed to reduce 12 ounces of ice into a **granulated texture** in under **45 seconds**—a performance unmatched by any other mid-range blenders we assessed. 

\[1045\] Oster Pro 1200 Blender Smoothie

Its expertise in blending fresh fruits was also very impressive. In just **90 seconds**, apples, bananas, and pineapples were effortlessly transformed into **a delectable, velvety mixture.**

Oster could even whip up spreadable almond butter and a drinkable protein shake, though it worked slower than the NutriBullet and Vitamix 5200. 

The only shortcoming was its **challenge** with frozen fruit smoothies. Even after a prolonged 5-minute blending, it failed to fully integrate mango and strawberry chunks, leaving them distinctly visible in the mix.

Design-wise, the Oster Pro pairs a medium-grade plastic structure with a brushed nickel finish. Though it may not match the durability or visual charm of premium models, it upholds quality standards within its cheaper market segment.

The Oster Pro also scores highly in terms of usability with clearly labeled and responsive controls. Despite some initial confusion around the On/Off and Stop buttons, we quickly mastered it.

4\. Best Immersion: Braun MultiQuick 5 Hand Blender

*   Consistent, splash-free performance.
*   Comparable efficiency to pricier Vitamix blenders.
*   Ergonomic handle for a secure grip.
*   Remains cool even during heavy-duty use.
*   Versatile with a generous accessory set.

*   Metal blending shaft and whisk could potentially harm non-stick coatings.

Balancing affordability with satisfactory performance, the Braun MultiQuick-5 is a worthy contender in the mid-range category. While its aesthetic may not be striking, it more than compensates with the ability to manage a wide range of textures.

\[4\] The Braun MutiQuick-5 Smoothie Result

The real test of this immersion blender comes with pureéing performance, where it comfortably surpassed our expectations with **smooth, creamy soup** blended in only **30 seconds**. Equally impressive was its **near-perfect** frozen fruit smoothie ready in just **one minute**. 

Its whisk attachment was also a game-changer. It allowed us to effortlessly crafted a **delectably silky mayonnaise** in under **2 minutes**. And when it came to whipping large batches of egg whites, it turned the blender into a hand mixer, delivering **flawlessly, achieving stiff peaks** with remarkable ease.

The blender’s build, though not featuring the high-end materials seen in costlier models, reflects its price point appropriately. We found some minor external scratches during our testing, but these cosmetic imperfections don’t impair its capability. 

Our Braun MultiQuick-5 had straightforward controls. It also features an ergonomically designed handle which is coated with a distinctive rubberized layer. Together with the blender’s minimal weight, this made it simple and comfy to handle, even when our hands were wet or greasy. 

Be mindful, though, the trigger demands a bit more pressure than average, which may pose challenges for users with weak grips or long nails.

5\. Best Personal: NutriBullet Pro 900W Personal Blender

*   It is very easy to assemble and use. 
*   Stainless steel extractor blades are tough enough to power through even solid ingredients like ice cubes.
*   BPA-free plastic cups are durable and dishwasher safe. 
*   Hands-free operation offers superior convenience 
*   Motor base is very stable.

*   It's difficult to clean the blades’ undersides.

The NutriBullet Pro earns top marks for its remarkable ability to produce nutrient-packed meals. It doesn’t sacrifice performance for its small footprint. Instead, this little powerhouse matches—or even surpasses—the capabilities of its full-sized counterparts. 

\[Video-297\] NutriBullet 900-Watt Pro Frozen Fruits Smoothie Video

Among all the personal blenders we've tested, the NutriBullet Pro is the **most versatile**, managing a variety of ingredients swiftly and effortlessly. In the protein shake test, it was the **fastest contender**, mixing a **silky-smooth workout** drink in only 40 seconds. 

It also produced an **unparalleled frozen fruit smoothie** in less than a minute and **expertly processed leafy greens** into their finest state within only 20 seconds. Indeed, no other personal blender we tested could produce such ideal textures in the same time frames. 

The combination of fast-spinning blades and a 900-watt motor also made **ice crushing a breeze**. It allowed the blender to finish the task in **about 40 seconds**, and so far we haven't found a single machine that can crush ice as fluffy as this one. 

However, the NutriBullet Pro is not just about power and performance; it also **scores highly on design and durability**. Its motor base, although susceptible to scratches, is well-crafted. The durable blending cups, meanwhile, can withstand both scratches and high speeds. 

Moreover, the blades are designed for strength rather than sharpness, which actually makes it better at pulverizing ingredients for optimal nutrient extraction.

-------------------

A few quick notes on other blenders we tested:

*   [Vitamix E310](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/vitamix/vitamix-e310-explorian/): Compared to the Vitamix 5200, the E310 offers the same premium and classic blender feel but at a more affordable price. It even could transform 12 oz of solid ice into snow-like consistency in just 30 seconds, winning hands-down against the 5200 with ease. However, its 48 fl. oz. capacity is smaller than the 5200's 64 fl. oz., making the latter better for larger needs. 
*   [Vitamix 5-speed](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/vitamix/vitamix-immersion-blender/):  While the Vitamix 5-speed delivered remarkable blending capabilities in our test, we decided against designating it as our top pick due to its premium price, which may not be accessible to everyone. Plus, the lack of a whisk attachment made it somewhat less versatile when compared to the Braun MultiQuick-5.
*   [Ninja QB3001SS Fit](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/ninja/ninja-qb3001ss-fit/): The Ninja Fit and NutriBullet Pro offer similar performance efficiency, but the Ninja QB3001SS Fit is less convenient to use as it lacks hands-free operation feature. To operate it, you must hold the cup in place throughout the blending process, and at times, you might need to shake or stir the contents to ensure even blending.

**Which type of blender is right for you?**

Choosing a blender requires considerations that go beyond just brand name. It involves a deeper understanding of crucial aspects like power, speed settings, design, and more. But most importantly, determine which kind of blender—immersion, personal, or full-sized—best aligns with your needs.

**What's the Main Difference between Blenders and Food Processors?**

Blenders are best for liquids and semi-liquids, ideal for smoothies, milkshakes, and purees with multiple speed settings. On the other hand, food processors excel in tasks like slicing, chopping, grating, and dough preparation. They have larger bowls suitable for batch cooking and can handle both solid and semi-solid foods.
