The Black+Decker Crush Master trades a bit of versatility for its affordability. Heavy-duty tasks like preparing frozen fruit smoothies and fluffy crushed ice might be underwhelming. In most other respects, however, this blender does put up a good show. If you're after a low-cost blender with just the right power for simpler recipes—such as vibrant green smoothies, rich nut butter, nourishing protein shakes, or hearty baby food, —the Black+Decker certainly lives up to the hype. Nonetheless, it’s worth noting that while this blender isn’t too deficient by any means, for an extra $40, you'll get an [all-arounder](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/) that may surprise you with its breadth of capabilities.

**Things We Like**

*   Removal blade assembly for thorough cleaning 
*   Priced affordably, while still providing sufficient power for basic tasks
*   Compact and portable footprint

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Difficulty in removing the lid 
*   Stiff control buttons 
*   Noticeable smell of burning plastic

The classic design of the Black+Decker Crush Master provides it with a strong sense of nostalgia. This style is a stark contrast to the digital, touch-screen blenders that populate many modern kitchens, and for some, it may be a welcome reminder of the tactile, hands-on nature of cooking and creating in years gone by.

We like this Black+Decker Crush Master and firmly believe it’s a worthy affordable blender to buy. However, there are alternatives to consider such as the [Oster](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/oster/oster-pro-1200-blender/) and [NutriBullet](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/nutribullet/nutribullet-znbf30500z-blender-combo-1200w/). Check out our in-depth review for more detail on where the Black+Decker shines and where it could use a bit more polish.

When processing frozen fruits or ice cubes, The Black+Decker Crush Master’s efficiency dips a bit, but otherwise it is a decent blender for various simpler blends. Its capability in making almond butter is quite impressive, churning out a paste that is creamy and flavorful. Furthermore, it can deliver a velvety smooth green smoothie or a complex shakes without too much struggle. 

The only issue was that our Black+Decker consistently emitted a heated-plastic-like odor across all testing performances. While this didn’t impair the overall result, it cast doubts on the blender’s reliability over the long term.

### Smoothie

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clu973x8i001ktf88awuzhng8.jpg" alt="Black and Decker 10 Speed Blender Smoothie Video" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clioa4xt10002ab88bv0ha79p.jpg" alt="The Black+Decker Crush Master blender motor base and its container stand on a table, accompanied by a glass filled with a green smoothie.

Blending Time: 3 mins 30 seconds

Result: Silky Smooth

For this test, we selected a combination of apples, bananas, kale, and milk as our ingredients, and we were delighted to find that the Black+Decker could yield a smooth and creamy concoction without much effort. While the overall blending process took approximately three and a half minutes, the true efficiency of this blender was revealed in the first 30 seconds. Within this period, it pulverized all the fruit and left only a small smattering of kale remnants.

This speedy performance means the Black+Decker is a reliable choice for those seeking a quick, convenient way to handle solely fruit-based ingredients. On the other hand, there will be a slight extension in the blending time when it comes to blending tougher green ingredients such as kale. Nonetheless, in the end, every additional second is well justified by the superior quality of the resulting blend.

### Frozen Fruit Smoothie

" width="300px" height="200px">

Blending Time: 5 mins

Result: Chunky

In this test, the blending procedure was either halted at the 5-minute mark or once a smooth mixture was attained. As we progressed, it became evident that the Black+Decker’s capability in preparing frozen fruit smoothies was only average. 

Even after reaching our time benchmark, a chunk of strawberry remained unprocessed. We can’t say for sure whether a longer blending duration would have yielded a smoother blend. However, it's clear that the blender fell short of producing the sought-after, ice-cream-like texture. Given the quick thawing of frozen fruits at room temperature, a blender's inability to blend them swiftly did result in a water-down consistency. 

Nonetheless, considering the blender’s price, one might argue this could be a reasonable compromise while others are willing to manually remove the intact chunk for an unimpeded sipping sensation. Not to mention that some of its rivals even didn't manage to pulverize any fruit pieces.

### Protein Shake

Blending Time: 2 mins 30 seconds

Result: Slightly smooth

When it comes to blending raw nuts, dried fruits, oatmeal, and protein powder into a shake, the Black+Decker stands out as one of the best blenders in this range capable of producing a smooth, drinkable blend. 

While it didn’t compete with the lightning-fast performance of its higher-powered counterparts, such as the [Vitamix E310](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/vitamix/vitamix-e310-explorian/), it still managed to surpass many similarly-priced rivals, with a respectable blending time of two and a half minutes in this test. 

Straining the final protein shake through a mesh sieve revealed a small amount of dried berries and almond bits. However, the majority of the oatmeal was successfully liquified and these particles were as tiny as sesame seeds so the drink didn’t feel gritty at all.

### Almond Butter

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clioaa3f40008ab88cd351w7u.jpg" alt="The Black+Decker Crush Master is beside a white plate containing almond butter with a spatula and a smartphone revealing a blending time of 3 minutes and a half." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clioaae3p0009ab88c5std55m.jpg" alt="A sample of almond butter created with the Black+Decker Crush Master blender, spread on white paper." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clsobm5d7000gk28856a68sdw.jpg" alt="Black and Decker 10 Speed Blender Almond Butter Video" width="300px" height="200px">

Blending Time: 3 mins 30 seconds

Result: Smooth

Compared to other blending processes like those for fruits or vegetables, almond butter creation demands extended blending time so that thorough grinding of almonds and emulsification of their oils can be achieved. Thus, we deem Oster's blending duration of 3 minutes and 30 seconds in this test to be just right—not excessively lengthy.

The final result was well-blended. It had a rich and relatively smooth texture, with almost no large chunks or unevenly processed bits. Its flavor was an absolute delight; the blending process successfully brought out the natural sweetness and nuttiness of the almonds.

### Crushed Ice

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clioacjws000bab886ho80ux3.jpg" alt="The BLACK+DECKER  blender is beside a black tray containing its crushed ice.

Ice Fineness: Coarse

Unblended Ice: 79% of 12 oz

The BLACK+DECKER is inadequate for the demanding task of crushing ice cubes due to the lack of necessary power. Despite the blender’s significant effort, most of the ice remained pristine and unbroken. 

However, our findings suggest that this limitation is not exclusive to the BLACK+DECKER alone. There are many blenders in this price range facing similar challenges, with some even unable to dent the ice, let alone successfully break it down into fluffy consistency. 

Should you have a strong preference for this sort of blend, we recommend considering the NutriBullet, Oster, and Ninja AMZ493BRN.

Compact and portable, the Black+Decker Crush Master comfortably fits on any countertop. Its thoughtful features include a simple control panel, heat-resistant blending container, and easily removable blade assembly for thorough cleaning. That being said, the blender’s overall quality isn't on par with pricier models due to the use of low-grade plastic components.

### Dimensions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clioaf8h0000eab882nm248pz.jpg" alt="Illustrated dimensions of the Black+Decker Crush Master showing the height, length, and width in inches." width="300px" height="200px">

Height: 15.8" (40.1 cm)

Width: 6.3" (16.0 cm)

Weight: 6.7 lbs (3.0 kg)

Length: 8.3" (21.0 cm)

The Black+Decker Crush Master stands 15.8 inches tall. This is around the same height as many drip coffee makers, so this blender will fit comfortably on any countertop. As heavy as a large stainless steel kettle, it measures approximately 6.7 pounds, which gives it good stability during use but isn't overly burdensome to move around.

### 6.0 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clioahyxb000fab883jrgezy5.jpg" alt="A closeup of the Black+Decker Crush Master blender’s motor base and container" width="300px" height="200px">

The Black+Decker Crush Master Motor Base and Container

The Black+Decker Crush Master's overall quality doesn't quite hit the mark, and while this is somewhat expected given its price point, certain aspects could benefit from improvements. 

The motor housing is made from low-grade plastic, which gives it a quite lackluster impression. Not only this, but the lid and its associated cap are also affected by this subpar material. This makes the blender itself lack the robustness and sleekness as typically seen in pricer models. 

Further concerns arise from the friction between the blade assembly and the drive socket while blending. During one of our first tests, this friction somehow caused overheating. This then resulted in a black residue on the drive socket, presumably a consequence of overheated plastic components within the blade assembly melting down. It also marked the onset of an unsettling burning smell from the blender in subsequent uses.

### 7.0 - Blades

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clioaj1ce000gab8835pgazaq.jpg" alt="A close-up of the Black+Decker blender’s blade assembly" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clioajjcv000hab889msu9x36.jpg" alt="A close-up of the Black+Decker blender’s blade assembly" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Stainless Steel

Type: Cross

Blade Count: 4 sharp blades

Removable: Yes

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

The Black+Decker’s blade features 4 hardened stainless steel prongs. Each prong is shaped with a purposeful curve which can help promote a better vortex so that all the ingredients can be effectively drawn towards the blades for an even blend, compared to conventional blades of most other blenders. It also helps distribute the force more evenly, reducing the chances of jamming or damaging the blades.

The blade has a moderate sharpness, but doesn't measure up in terms of thickness and size compared to higher-priced models. It lacks the heft and scale which potentially limits its effectiveness when dealing with solid ingredients like frozen fruit and ice.

### Motor Base

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clioakpdd000iab888bfm0z4m.jpg" alt="A close-up of the Black+Decker blender’s motor base " width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clioalioj000jab88dkhi1im9.jpg" alt="A close-up of the underside of the Black+Decker blender’s motor base" width="300px" height="200px">

Rated Voltage: 120 Volts

Rated Power: 550 Wattages

Working Time: N/A

Protection: No

Weight: 2.5 pounds

Cord Length: NaN ft (NaN m)

The Black+Decker Crush Master's motor base is equipped with four feet to enhance stability. However, due to their lack of suction capabilities, we found that our blender tended to move around on the countertop during all the heavy-duty testing.

 In our test, we noticed the motor heated up toward extended use while the lack of an automatic overload protection feature leaves the blender vulnerable to overheating damage. So far, we haven't found any reports of severe wear, tear, or motor burnouts related to this issue, though.

### Blending Container

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clioamyl6000kab88b6lr7fu0.jpg" alt="Illustrated dimensions of the Black+Decker Crush Master showing the height, depth, and width in inches" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clioaneyu000lab88a6jtccge.jpg" alt="The blending container, blade assembly, lid, and lid-plug of the Black+Decker Crush Master blender on a table." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Glass

Capacity: 48 oz

Weight: 3,5 pounds

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Measurement: Yes

Suitable For: Small to medium batches

The Black+Decker Crush Master's blending container is made from glass. Despite a slightly yellow hue and a lack of total clarity, it preserves the inherent heat-resistance and insulating capabilities that are traditionally found in transparent clear glass. As such, whether you're whipping up a steaming hot soup or a warm, comforting baby puree, the blender stands up to the task efficiently and safely.

However, as glass is considerably heavier than plastic, it makes pouring and cleaning a bit more cumbersome. Despite this, we found it still manageable, though it's something to be aware of.

The container is adorned with measurement markings in liters, cups, and ounces. While cups and ounces are intuitive and straightforward, the liter markings could be more refined. Presented in fractions (e.g., 1/4, 1/2), they could potentially pose understanding difficulties for users more familiar with decimal-based units.

### Lid

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clioapn3k000mab886d2odqfg.jpg" alt="A close-up of the Black+Decker two-part lid" width="300px" height="200px">

The Black+Decker Two-Part Lid

Material:  Plastic

Closing Type: Friction

Features: Lid-plug

The lid is designed in a two-part structure rather than being a single solid piece. It features a main lid, which sits tightly on top of the blender jar, and a central lid plug, which offers the convenience of adding ingredients while the blender is in operation without the need to fully remove the lid. 

The friction-based design of the main lid holds securely, but its lack of a handle makes its removal challenging and less user-friendly.

### 6.0 - Control Panel

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clioaqswp000nab886j8jajag.jpg" alt="A close-up of the Black+Decker control panel" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cljzjljve000qeg88790o73a3.jpg" alt="the Black+Decker blender motor base on table, hand pressing digital tachometer attached to tripod, different blenders in background.

Activation: Press-button

Min Speed: 13,003 RPM

Max Speed: 18,373 RPM

Presets: No

Digital Display: No

Built-in Timer: No

Pulse Mode: Yes

The control panel comes with a single row of buttons that are neatly organized and labeled for clear identification. Initially, there may be a slight learning curve, but with a little practice, manipulating it turns out to be quite intuitive. However, we believe the firmness of these buttons may not sit well with some users, especially those who are accustomed to the modern touch-sensitive or softer press controls offered by other blenders.

### Extra Accessory

The Black+Decker Crush Master is user-friendly overall, but there are certain areas where it may require getting used to. Tackling tough ingredients often demands a bit of manual intervention, and removing the lid could prove to be a mini workout due to its strong seal and lack of handle. These traits may cause slight annoyances when needing to even out the blend. Not to mention the odor potentially emitted during use may overshadow your blending experience.

### 7.0 - Ease of Blend

The Black+Decker may occasionally need a little manual intervention during the blending process, especially when tackling tough ingredients. However, due to a lack of a handle and its strong seal to the container, the lid is somewhat frustrating to remove. As a result, every attempt to redistribute the contents within the blender may become an inconvenient and annoying experience. 

Furthermore, the persistent emission of a burning plastic smell throughout the blending process has left us in a state of continuous worry. Was the blender overheating? Was it a manufacturing defect or a sign of impending failure? Could it even be a potential fire hazard? Such apprehensions are hard to ignore and they cast a shadow of unease over the entire blending experience.

### 6.5 - Noise Level

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clioav47r000qab883i9yhidb.jpg" alt="The Black+Decker blender is on a table, accompanied by a sound level meter displaying its noise level nearby. In the background, other blenders that we tested sit on a nearby shelf." width="300px" height="200px">

Max Level: 102.5 dB

To replicate the conditions of blending a frozen smoothie, we opted to use ice cubes and water as our test materials. Upon testing, we found that the noise level of the Black+Decker averaged around 102.5 dB. For a sense of scale, this is roughly as loud as a running motorcycle or a handheld chainsaw, which can be quite loud and disruptive in a home setting. 

### 6.0 - Assembly

The initial process of attaching the container to the motor base may have required some trial and error to align the rims, but as you become more familiar with it, things will become remarkably simpler. 

On the other hand, the lid's removal remains the sole challenge that you may have to deal with whenever you use your blender. Despite your frequency of use, it seems to be a persistent difficulty to pry it open due to the lack of a handle and its tight suction to the container. It always demanded us to exert significant force and to contend with resistance to get the job done. This, as a result, often led to unwelcome spills and splatters.

### 8.0 - Cleanability

With a smooth and almost unblemished inner surface, the blending container eases the cleaning process as most food particles often effortlessly wash away under a gentle stream of water. 

The blade assembly can be removed from the container. This allows access from all angles and ensures thorough cleanliness after each use. However, it is important to exercise caution due to its sharp edges, for which a cleaning brush can be your reliable companion in this task.

Wiping down the motor base is relatively easy, but the crevices and gaps around the buttons demand extra care and attention to ensure their cleanliness and proper functioning. Such areas often accumulate dirt, grime, and food particles over time. It is also essential to be mindful of the amount of liquid or cleaning solutions used and take measures to prevent them from seeping into the sensitive components. Excessive moisture or the infiltration of cleaning agents into the button mechanism can result in issues such as sticking, unresponsiveness, or even complete failure.
