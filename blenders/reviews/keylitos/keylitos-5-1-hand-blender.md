The Keylitos 5-in-1 delivered average performance in our tests. It coped well with basic tasks like soup-making, nut-grinding, and smoothie-blending, though the results weren’t flawless. We also tested the additional accessories, particularly the whisk attachment, and found that this add-on could emulsify sauces and whisk egg whites effectively. 

### Hot Soup Purée

" width="300px" height="200px">

Pureeing Time: 30 seconds

Result: Slightly Chunky

Suction: Tightly

In a practical test of the Keylitos 5-in-1, a soup containing a mix of various vegetables was blended for exactly 30 seconds. A strainer inspection revealed that, within this short span, the blender effectively pureed the softer items like onion and pumpkin. Although it left behind discernible pieces of the more fibrous celery and carrot, we found the overall texture of the soup was still sufficiently fine for most purposes. Just noted that this performance did not match that of other [higher-priced blenders](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/), such as the Vitamix 5-speed and the Ninja Foodi, which mostly delivered a completely smooth soup within the same 30-second timeframe.

### Smoothie

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clq1srt9v0004pa88ayjna4ku.jpg" alt="Scooping a spoon of frozen fruit smoothie from a full batch in a plastic beaker made by the Keylitos 5-in-1 immersion blender in 1 minute 40 seconds." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clq1ss9c00005pa8867u705yc.jpg" alt="After finishing blending, the green smoothie made by the Keylitos 5-in-1 immersion blender was spread evenly throughout a paper to check for smoothness." width="300px" height="200px">

Blending Time: 1 min 40 secs

Result: Smooth

Suction: Slightly

In this test, the Keylitos 5-in-1 was put to work on a blend of kale, mango, and pineapple. The task took a total of 1 minute and 40 seconds to achieve a uniform consistency, which was nearly double the time of top-performing contenders like the Braun MultiQuick-5. The resulting smoothie had a fine texture; the fruits were well pureed, and the kale, though visible, was fine enough not to compromise the drink's smoothness. 

To get to this point, however, required more than simple blending; we found ourselves needing to continuously move and adjust the blender in the mixture, a task that was physically demanding and resulted in noticeable hand fatigue. This suggests that for those who often make frozen fruit smoothies, the Keylitos might **not be the most efficient option**. It's best suited for creating smoother concoctions from softer, fresh produce.

### Mayonnaise

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clq1sv13r0006pa8889dkbyrf.jpg" alt="A little bit of mayonnaise sticking in the whisk attachment of the Keylitos 5-in-1." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clq1svim30007pa88a3tnek77.jpg" alt="Scooping a spoon of mayonnaise made by the Keylitos 5-in-1 immersion blender." width="300px" height="200px">

Emulsifying Time: 1 min 29 secs

Result: Smooth

Suction: No

The emulsification process with the Keylitos, particularly using its whisk attachment, was impressively efficient and effective. As the blender operated, the whisk attachment skillfully facilitated the gradual blending of oil into egg yolks. This deliberate, drop-by-drop integration is crucial for creating a stable emulsion.

Such an approach resulted in a mayonnaise that was not just well-incorporated but also packed with a silky texture, ideal for both spreading on sandwiches and enhancing various dishes.

### Almond Milk

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clq1swf3g0008pa88geqd3f26.jpg" alt="The Keylitos 5-in-1 immersion blender beside its bowl of almond milk and the corresponding almond pulp produced in 1 minute." width="300px" height="200px">

Grinding Time: 1 min 15 secs

Result: Fine

Suction: Tightly

In this test, the Keylitos impressively produced a fine almond pulp within a swift one-minute of blending. This level of fineness, which became apparent after straining, suggests that the blender did extract a substantial amount of flavor and nutrients from the nuts, contributing to both the creaminess and richness of the final milk. 

Yet, the blending experience did present some challenges. The standard beaker provided was too small, leading to spills when the blender was moved too aggressively. Additionally, the blender's strong suction power posed difficulties in smoothly maneuvering the wand, often leading to a messy countertop. 

 It's also worth mentioning that during the grinding process, the blending shaft itself introduced a notable amount of air into the milk, resulting in a frothy top layer. While this frothiness does not detract from the milk's flavor, it may be a drawback for those who favor a perfectly smooth milk without the extra airiness.

### Whipped Egg-Whites

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clq1sx8tg0009pa88fvu33vo4.jpg" alt="The Keylitos 5-in-1 immersion blender stands next to a glass of whipped egg whites forming stiff peaks, with a digital timer showing "2:01" in the foreground." width="300px" height="200px">

Beating Time: 2 minutes

Result: Stiff

Suction: No

We tested the Keylitos with a specific challenge: to whip 100 ml of egg whites to stiff peaks. The blender took two minutes to achieve this, which is slightly longer than what you might expect from a specialized mixer but still within a reasonable time frame for such a task. 

The end result was a success; the egg whites transformed into a stable, airy foam that maintained its structure, even when the bowl was turned upside down. The experience was hassle-free; the whisk attachment moved effortlessly through the whites, aerating them without any mess or splatter. We didn't have to wrestle with the device or constantly adjust our grip, which made the process notably comfortable.

### Dimensions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clq1syp2y000bpa88fpw8fwhd.jpg" alt="The Keylitos 5-in-1 standing on a table, with the length of its blending shaft being noted to the side as 8 inches, and the total length of the unit as 15.4 inches." width="300px" height="200px">

Height: 15.4" (39.1 cm)

Width: 2.5" (6.4 cm)

Weight: 1.6 lbs (0.7 kg)

Shaft Length: 8.0" (20.3 cm)

In line with the most other immersion blenders we examined, the Keylitos is compact and manageable. Measuring 15.3 inches, it's akin to an average kitchen rolling pin in height, allowing it to be neatly tucked away in a drawer when its 8-inch shaft is removed.  

### 7.0 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clq1szce0000cpa88gn6v3rek.jpg" alt="A close-up of the blending shaft and motor housing of the Keylitos 5-in-1." width="300px" height="200px">

At its core, the Keylitos utilizes a medium-grade plastic which contributes to its lightness and ease of handling. However, this blender doesn't stop there – it steps up its game by incorporating brushed stainless steel elements into its structure. These steel accents do more than just inject a dash of sophistication into its appearance; they also bring a much-needed sturdiness to the device. 

In the course of our tests, our Keylitos did show some signs of wear – notably, a few scratches on the plastic housing. However, these were purely cosmetic and didn’t hinder the blender's performance. 

### Speed and Controls

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clq1t08hn000dpa88bumy4dfy.jpg" alt="A close-up of the Keylitos 5-in-1 immersion blender top dial" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clq1t0n9t000epa88cxw97dee.jpg" alt="A close-up of the Keylitos 5-in-1 immersion blender speed control buttons." width="300px" height="200px">

The Keylitos immersion blender boasts 12 speed settings, adjustable through a user-friendly combination of two buttons and a top-mounted dial. This range of speeds is ideal for accommodating various recipes, each demanding different levels of power and blending intensity. Such versatility enhances the blender's utility in diverse cooking tasks. 

### 7.0 - Blending Shaft

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clq1t1jmz000fpa88gi16hn8h.jpg" alt="A Close-Up of the Keylitos 5-in-1 Immersion Blender Blade" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Stainless steel

Type: Sharp Blade

Guard Material: Stainless steel

Blade Count: 2

Removable: Yes

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

The Keylitos features a two-pronged blade made of medium-quality stainless steel, which is relatively sharp and sturdy. The blade assembly includes a blade guard intended to prevent splattering, but we found it is not as effective as expected. Additionally, the blade guard is made of metal with rough edges. This poses a risk of scratching or marking non-stick cookware.

### 10 - Beaker

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clq1t2r9m000gpa88es0m4j2b.jpg" alt="A Close-Up of the Keylitos 5-in-1 Immersion Blender Beaker" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic

Capacity: 20 oz

Measurements: Yes

Weight:

Height:

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Using the Keylitos with its included 20-ounce beaker offers a practical solution for small to medium blending tasks. However, it's important to note that over time, the vigorous blending action may leave marks on the beaker.

### 10 - Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clq1t3gmj000hpa88691z6crg.jpg" alt="A close-up of the power cord of the Keylitos 5-in-1 immersion blender. " width="300px" height="200px">

Cord Length: 5.1 ft (1.6 m)

Type: 2-prong plug

Detachable: No

The Keylitos features a long power cord for easy access to outlets, complemented by a plastic clip for efficient cord management. This clip ensures the cord stays neatly organized and tangle-free when the device is not in use. 

### Extra Accessories: Whisk Attachment

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clq1t48jb000ipa884t6q8t35.jpg" alt="A close-up of the whisk attachment of the Keylitos 5-in-1 immersion blender. " width="300px" height="200px">

Material:  Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Removable: Yes

The whisk attachment for the Keylitos performs efficiently in tasks such as beating egg whites, whipping cream, and preparing emulsified sauces. Its polished stainless steel wires offer a sense of sturdiness and durability, especially when compared to lower-cost options like the [Hamilton hand blenders](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/hamilton-beach/hamilton-beach-59765-immersion/).

### Extra Accessories: Food Processor

Material: Plastic and Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Removable: Yes

We haven’t tested this attachment, but the food processor included with the Keylitos is likely capable of chopping, mixing, and shredding foods. However, although it is a convenient addition, its performance may not fully match that of a specialized stand-alone food processor.

### Extra Accessories: Milk Frothing

Material: Plastic and Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Removable: Yes

Similarly, we have yet to evaluate the milk frother that comes with the Keylitos. Typically, such attachments are designed to aerate milk, creating a rich and creamy froth ideal for beverages like cappuccinos and lattes. 

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **7.8**

*   Ease of Use (60%) - **7.4**/10
    
*   Blade Assembly (10%) - **9.0**/10
    
*   Handling (20%) - **8.0**/10
    
*   Cleanability (10%) - **8.5**/10
    

The Kelytos is adequately usable, with a balanced weight and straightforward controls for easy handling, and an ergonomic handle for comfort. Yet, its tendency to create strong suction at the container's bottom can make maneuvering somewhat tricky. 

### 7.4 - Ease of Use

We quickly mastered the use of the Keylitos blender, thanks to its intuitive design. 

The buttons are satisfyingly clicky, requiring only a gentle touch to operate. The front controls are responsive, making speed adjustments easy and efficient. However, using the top-mounted dial for speed control while also handling the blending shaft and keeping the beaker steady can be awkward. This challenge is exacerbated by the motor's strong vibration, causing noticeable wobble in the beaker. 

Nevertheless, for those who find dial adjustments tricky, the Kylitos offers a simple solution: pressing the Turbo button instantly ramps up the blender to its maximum speed.

The suction effect is present but not overly pronounced in the Keylitos. Initially, this might require some adjustment from the user, but with regular use, it becomes a manageable characteristic.

### 9.0 - Blade Assembly

To assemble our blender, we aligned the blending wand or whisk attachment with the motor body until it securely clicked into place. Disassembling was just as straightforward: a counterclockwise rotation of the attachment followed by a pull away from the body. Although there's a slight resistance when pulling the attachment off, it's not overly strenuous.

### 8.0 - Handling

In all our tests, the blender's handle remained comfortably grippable due to its ergonomic design. Paired with the machine's lightweight, this design effectively staved off hand fatigue, even during lengthy and intense blending sessions. Still, its smooth finish may make the grip less secure when your hands get wet or greasy. 

### 8.5 - Cleanability

We found that the simplest and most efficient method to clean the blending wand or any other attachment was to scrub it under running water. This approach usually allowed for rapid removal of food residues. However, when residues accumulated on the backside of the blades, accessing and cleaning these areas could be slightly tricky due to the small gap between the blade and its housing.
