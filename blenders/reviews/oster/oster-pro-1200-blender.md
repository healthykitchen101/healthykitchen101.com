Between its powerful 1200-watt motor and compact footprint, the Oster Pro is a comfortable and practical machine. It's smaller and more affordable than most other high-powered blenders but gives up little in terms of versatility. It's a nice option for those looking to enrich their kitchen arsenal without committing to a significant investment.

In our testing, this blender delivered commendable results, excelling in crushing ice and proving itself more than capable of making almond butter and protein shakes. Its proficiency in blending smoothies, however, was less straightforward; while it performed admirably with standard smoothies, it struggled in the face of frozen fruits. Nevertheless, after further experimentation, we found that modifying the portion size yielded far smoother blended drinks.

**Things We Like**

*   Good value for the money
*   Well-organized control buttons 
*   A lot easier to clean and assemble than many of its rivals
*   Excels at preparing green smoothies, almond butter, and crushed ice

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Lackluster capability in making frozen fruit smoothies 
*   Gimmicky control panel

The Oster Pro is a 1200-watt blender that goes for around $70—quite a bit less than alternatives like the [NutriBullet](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/nutribullet/nutribullet-znbf30500z-blender-combo-1200w/), [Ninja BN701](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/ninja/ninja-professional-plus-bn701/), or [Cuisinart](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/cuisinart/cuisinart-spb-7ch-smartpower/). And as the "budget" option in the segment, it offers a delicate balance of features and functionality. Highlights include the thermal-shock-resistant container, three pre-programmed settings, an extra on-the-go blending cup, and dual-direction blade technology.

In our hands-on testing, the Oster Pro came up short in terms of making frozen fruit smoothies. However, it pleasantly surprised us with its exceptional performance in other tasks. Not only was it able to create a velvety texture with various fresh fruits, but it also successfully made almond butter and protein shakes. Most notably, it outperformed many other [mid-priced blenders](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/) when crushing ice cubes.

### Smoothie

Blending Time: 1 mins 30 seconds

Result: Silky Smooth

Of all the mid-priced blenders we tested, the Oster Pro stands out as a top performer in the realm of smoothie blending. Within 30 seconds, it made short work of a medley of fresh fruits. Apples, bananas, and pineapples were effortlessly transformed into a delectable, velvety blend. There were still some notable particles of the fibrous kale left behind at this initial stage, but our Oster didn't falter. After another minute of blending, we had a near-perfect smoothie with every last bit of kale beautifully incorporated. 

The Oster Pro stood out in a field of Cuisinart and Ninja blenders, carving out a deserved place in your morning routine. Its efficiency in making green smoothies does more than just save precious time—it simplifies and streamlines your food preparation.

### Frozen Fruit Smoothie

Blending Time: 5 mins

Result: Chunky

In this particular test, the Oster blender's ability to blend frozen fruits was overshadowed not only by rival premium models, but other mid-range counterparts as well. Upon reaching our hard limit of 5 minutes, it appeared that all the pineapple was fully liquefied, but that wasn’t enough to create a smooth, drinkable consistency. We noticed that approximately half of the mango remained partially blended while the strawberries largely retained their original form. 

We haven’t been able to nail down a reason for the imperfect results, but we have some hypotheses. One issue may be the size of the fruit chunks—if they were too large, the blades may have had trouble powering through them. The gap between the blades and the container’s bottom also caught our attention. There was enough space to trap fruit chunks under the blades while blending, leaving those chunks unfinished and also impeding the suction force.

### Protein Shake

Blending Time: 1 min 50 seconds

Result: Slightly Smooth

In this test, the Oster took nearly one minute and fifty seconds to fully liquefy 1.5 ounces of oatmeal. Even then, however, there were still some partially blended fruit pieces remaining. Nevertheless, it still managed to pulverize almonds, dried berries, and oatmeal better than most. A bit of extra blending time eliminated the chunks. And even if they remained, the main goal is to liquefy all the oatmeal. Fruit chunks can add a nice twist that many users will enjoy.

### Almond Butter

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cli1ctud00016ey883u6y0ztq.jpg" alt="The Oster Pro is beside a white plate containing almond butter with a spatula and a smartphone revealing a blending time of 6 minutes." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cli1cubd10017ey880wcf2z3n.jpg" alt="A sample of almond butter created with a NutriBullet blender, spread on white paper." width="300px" height="200px">

Blending Time: 3 mins 30 seconds

Result: Silky Smooth

Unlike some other blending tasks, such as pulverizing fruits or vegetables, the creation of almond butter demands a long blending time. This extended duration is necessary to grind it all and emulsify the nuts’ oils. As such, we consider the Oster's blending time of 3 minutes and 30 seconds appropriate. In fact, it was rather impressive when compared to popular blenders like the NutriBullet or Ninja BN701, which required nearly double the time. 

The Oster Pro was able to grind all the almonds (2 cups) into a fine powder within the first 30 seconds. This remarkable speed can be attributed to its robust motor and six-pronged blades, which work seamlessly together and create a strong vortex that draws the contents toward its blades.

The remaining time was all about oil extraction and emulsification. Once the almonds started releasing oil, we noticed clumps adhering to the container’s sides and bottom. It’s a common occurrence when it comes to making nut butter. For the most part, we didn’t find it frustrating to pause the blender now and then to break up clumps. And sometimes a good shake was all that was needed to throw food down into the blades.  

The Oster’s butter was well-blended, creamy, and delicious. We were also happy to find that the Oster Pro didn’t produce enough heat to overload the motor or harm the nut butter’s quality.

### Crushed Ice

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cli1cvf5i0018ey88hu8d3t3o.jpg" alt="The Oster Pro blender is beside a black tray containing its crushed ice." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cli1cwa6k0019ey88gtj5ak4i.jpg" alt="The Oster Pro blender is beside a black tray containing its crushed ice." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clt2dqdjb0024k28828jr1hkv.jpg" alt="Oster Pro 1200 Blender Crushed Ice Video" width="300px" height="200px">

Ice Fineness: Very Fine

Unblended Ice: 0% of 12 oz

While the Oster Pro didn’t craft a perfect frozen fruit smoothie, it performed exceptionally well in our ice-crushing test. It only took this blender 45 seconds to turn a full 12 ounces of ice cubes into a fine, sugar-like texture. Such a feat was unmatched by any other mid-priced blender we tested. 

With its great ice-crushing capabilities, the Oster Pro is perfect for your refreshing cocktails, delectable sorbets, and even intricate gourmet ice-based desserts. However, it's worth noting that you’ll probably need to pause at least once to give your blender a good shake.

Height: 14.5" (36.8 cm)

Width: 7.6" (19.3 cm)

Weight: 7.8 lbs (3.5 kg)

Length: 7.3" (18.4 cm)

The Oster Pro is more compact than many blenders. That can be annoying if you need to prepare large quantities, but it does make the device easy to store. It’s also sure to fit under your cabinets.

### 7.0 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cli1ceins000uey88gbx4dttw.jpg" alt="A close up of the Oster Pro motor base and container" width="300px" height="200px">

The Oster Pro Motor Base and Container

With a brushed nickel finish, the Oster Pro won’t be affected by light and heat. Its surface hasn’t dulled after all our rigorous testing. In fact, even minor things like fingerprints and smudges barely show up. It’s easy to keep this blender looking new. 

In terms of build materials, the Oster Pro features medium-grade components. While it may not be as robust or beautiful as premium blenders, it does strike a nice balance between durability and affordability.

### 8.0 - Blades

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cli1cfwb0000vey88ero05c3p.jpg" alt="A close-up of the Oster Pro’s blades" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cli1ch27v000wey88agrd1c7b.jpg" alt="A close-up of the Oster Pro’s blades" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Stainless Steel

Type: Cross

Blade Count: 6 sharp blades

Removable: Yes

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Conventional mid-range blenders have a bad habit of jamming food under their blades. That can make for less-than-smooth smoothies. The Oster Pro is different, though, because you can put it in reverse. If the blades lock up, just reverse the rotation to free them. There’s rarely a need to open things up and stir. 

Additionally, the Oster Pro is one of the few mid-range blenders to boast a 6-prong blade; most of its competitors have only four or sometimes just two prongs. More prongs mean more food is engaged at any given moment, which results in faster and finer blending.

### Motor Base

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cli1cionq000xey88b0qt1gju.jpg" alt="The Oster Pro Motor Base" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cli1cjpov000yey882b4n0jty.jpg" alt="A close-up of the Oster Pro Motor Base" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cli1ckdzj000zey88309h1m1z.jpg" alt="A close-up of the underside of the Oster Pro’s motor base" width="300px" height="200px">

Rated Voltage: 120 V

Rated Power: 1200 W

Working Time: N/A

Protection: Yes

Weight: 4.5 oz (128 g)

Cord Length: 2.9 ft (0.9 m)

The Oster Pro’s powerful motor is encased in a hard plastic frame under its nickel-alloy body. And that outer body’s brushed finish doesn’t retain fingerprints the way a reflective finish might.  

In addition, the Oster’s motor is more energy-efficient than some, so it shouldn’t drive your power bill up by much. It also sports built-in overheating protection which shuts the motor down if it’s in danger of exceeding its design capabilities. 

The power cord’s 2.6-foot length is on par with many common kitchen appliances, but we find it a little restrictive. Your opinion will likely depend on your kitchen setup and outlet accessibility.

### Blending Container

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cli1d0eyd001bey888xxzadl1.jpg" alt="Illustrated dimensions of the Oster Pro blending containers showing their heights and diameters in inches." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cli1d0yut001cey88dm7bezhu.jpg" alt="Illustrated dimensions of the Oster Pro 48-oz container showing the height and diameter in inches." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Glass

Capacity: 48.0 fl oz (1.4 L)

Weight: 3.2 oz (91 g)

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Measurement: Yes

Suitable For: Small to large batches

The blending container, made from mid-grade glass, appears slightly cloudy and yellow. However, its natural heat resistance and insulating properties remain intact. Hot ingredients should give this device no trouble. 

That being said, the trade-off comes in the form of weight. Glass containers are far heavier than plastic ones. It’s a minor annoyance while pouring and cleaning. We still found it to be manageable, but it’s worth a mention. 

One thing we’d like to see improved is the jar's measurement markings. It does have markings at one-cup intervals, but there are no finer gradations. You’ll have to break out the measuring cups for anything more precise. Nonetheless, we think the Oster’s overall efficiency offsets these small compromises.

### Lid

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cli1d2upr001eey881q77bk3y.jpg" alt="Oster Pro 1200 Blender Lid" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic

Closing Type: Friction

Features: Lid plug

The lid consists of two separate parts as opposed to a single solid plastic piece. It includes the main lid (which fits snugly atop the blender jar) and a central lid plug. This plug is multifunctional, serving as a filler cap for easy ingredient addition and a 2-ounce measuring cup for accurate small ingredient measurements.

### 8.0 - Control Panel

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cli1d3p3s001fey880b7p7dlr.jpg" alt="A close-up of the Oster Pro Control Panel" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clk0xf06c000zeg881mwl17si.jpg" alt="Oster Full-sized Blender Min Speed" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clk0xgntf0010eg88ai0uejzm.jpg" alt="Oster Full-sized Blender Max Speed" width="300px" height="200px">

Activation: Press-button

Min Speed: 4,546 RPM

Max Speed: 16,006 RPM

Presets: Yes

Digital Display: No

Built-in Timer: No

Pulse Mode: Yes

The Oster blender boasts a user-friendly control panel replete with advanced features and well-organized buttons. However, we question the designers’ thought process on some of them.  

For instance, there’s no reason to have both a Stop button and an On/Off button. The pre-programmed options also demand some scrutiny. Its “Frozen Smoothies” preset, for example, did not give us as good a smoothie as our actual test procedure. The presets are more gimmicky than functional—they make the Oster look hi-tech, but don’t improve its utility.

### Extra Accessory: 24-Oz Cup

Material: Plastic

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Removable: Yes

Included as a convenient addition to the package is a 24-ounce smoothie cup that fits on the blade assembly, turning your full-sized blender into a personal blender for smaller tasks. Also included is a lid with a tight-sealing spout, so the whole thing can become a to-go cup. 

Usability

While the Oster Pro blender has some confusing buttons, it offers a quite user-friendly experience. The noise it generates is similar to typical household appliances and is usually bearable. Assembly is simple and cleaning is a breeze. Just be careful with the sharp blade.

### 7.5 - Ease of Blend

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cli1d1d05001dey881kem4xdr.jpg" alt="Illustrated dimensions of the Oster Pro 24-oz cup showing the height and diameter in inches." width="300px" height="200px">

Despite the initial confusion surrounding the On/Off and Stop buttons, we quickly figured out how to run the machine. 

We also appreciate the thoughtful design of the control panel, with the buttons not only giving us a satisfying click, but also the labels being prominently displayed and easy to read. 

However, unlike some other blenders within the same power range, the Oster Pro occasionally needs some manual help during the blending process. While it performs fine for simple blending tasks, it may struggle when faced with tougher ingredients. In such cases, it may be necessary to pause the blender and redistribute the contents.

### 7.1 - Noise Level

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cli1dfuj9001gey88131vgjn7.jpg" alt="The Oster Pro blender is on a table, accompanied by a sound level meter displaying its noise level nearby. In the background, other blenders that we tested sit on a nearby shelf." width="300px" height="200px">

Max Level: 99.7 dB

To simulate the blending of an icy smoothie, we use ice cubes and water as test materials. Our measurements indicated that the Oster’s noise level averaged approximately 99.7 dB.

This sound intensity is akin to that of a vacuum cleaner or motorcycle engine, but luckily the frequency was not as harsh and grating. 

Overall, we found the noise level to be high but tolerable. If you are sensitive to loud sounds or plan to use the blender in noise-sensitive environments, this may be a bigger factor to you.

### 8.5 - Assembly

The Oster blender comes together in three basic steps. 

First, you position the blade assembly within the container. It takes a little patience, but isn’t complicated. Next, place the container onto the motor base. You may have to jostle it a little before the drive shaft slides into place. Finally, press the lid securely into place atop the container, and you’re ready to go.

### 8.5 - Cleanability

The container has a smooth, barely-grooved internal surface that simplifies the cleaning process. Most food particles wash away effortlessly under a stream of water. 

For the motor base, you can easily wipe it down with a soft cloth. Fortunately, the lid seals tightly, so you’re unlikely to see many spills. 

We were happy to find that the blade is removable. Since you can access it from every angle, you can be sure it is fully clean every time. Just be careful of its sharp edges—a detail brush can be your best friend here.
