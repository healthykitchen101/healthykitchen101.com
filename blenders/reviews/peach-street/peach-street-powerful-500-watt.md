The Peach Street immersion blender steps into our spotlight with efficiency and capability often associated with low-range immersion blenders. While it wasn’t the perfect contender in any test, it proved capable enough to handle a variety of tasks such as preparing soup, mayonnaise, nut milk, and even frozen fruit smoothies. That being said, a lack of comfort may leave you wanting more. At its peak speed settings, the blender’s motor vibrates noticeably, which leads to a shaky grip and an unsettling hand-feel. The user interface also presents a hurdle, with hard buttons that require a firm press.

**Things We Like**

*   It is easy to attach, remove, and clean.
*   The blending wand is dishwasher-safe.
*   Its 500-watt motor can blend frozen fruits, puree hot soup, and emulsify sauces.

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Significant motor’s vibration.
*   Tight suction to the blending container’s bottom. 
*   Controlling buttons are hard to press. 
*   Metal blade’s guard can scratch the blending container’s bottom.

The kitchen appliance market is always buzzing with the entry of new brands, each bringing its own blend of innovation and design. Among the newcomers, Peach Street has made its debut with a stylish 500-watt immersion blender. As the new kid on the block, Peach Street is just starting to carve out its niche and its first attempt with this immersion blender has shown promise. However, it’s clear that there's a pathway of improvements awaiting, as our testing reveals the product still needs fine-tuning its ergonomics and usability.

During our testing of the Peach Street immersion blender, we found it to be a versatile tool, capable of handling various tasks. While it lacks a whisk attachment for egg whites, its powerful 500-watt motor excels at blending soups, creating smoothies from frozen fruits, and producing mayonnaise and almond milk with acceptable results. 

### Hot Soup Purée

Pureeing Time: 30 seconds

Result: Smooth

Suction: Tightly

In this test, our Peach Street managed to perform fairly quickly. It broke down all cooked ingredients in just 30 seconds. A subsequent strain revealed trapped residues, which means the final texture didn’t achieve the silky smooth consistency often associated with restaurant-quality soup. However, we believe blending longer than our time benchmark could potentially yield smoother results. So if time isn't a pressing concern, this blender is indeed not a bad choice. 

Just keep in mind the blender's propensity to create a tight suction at the bottom of the blending cup during operation, which can complicate the blending process as you attempt to maneuver the wand up and down. It also poses a particular risk when blending in a scratch-prone pot, as the blender comes with a metal wand that could easily mar the surface.

### Smoothie

Blending Time: 1 min 40 secs

Result:  Smooth

Suction: Slightly

We have to say that crafting frozen fruit smoothies with the Peach Street is a labor-intensive task. The entire blending process only lasted 1 minute and 40 seconds. To promote the blend, however, we had to continually apply significant force to push down the wand for better contact between the fruits and its blades. Coupled with the hard-to-press buttons, it felt like we were engaged in a muscle-training session rather than a daily kitchen task. 

The final product was a smoothie with a smooth and undiluted consistency, rich in the vibrant and fresh flavors of kale, mango, and pineapple. Despite the rewarding taste and texture, the discomfort endured suggests that the Peach Street may not be the most suitable choice for heavy-duty blending tasks such as creating frozen treats.

### Mayonnaise

Emulsifying Time: 2 mins 09 secs

Result: Smooth

Suction: Slightly

The process of making mayonnaise with the Peach Street Immersion Blender took 2 minutes and 9 seconds to complete, which is slightly on the longer side, but not excessively so. Still, the discomfort experienced while maneuvering the blender made this duration feel more tedious. Regarding the end product, the mayonnaise lacked a fully homogenized consistency, as evidenced by a minor oil layer visible on the surface. Nonetheless, it was still usable with a decent texture, and the taste remained unaffected. For those less particular about texture, the outcome might be satisfactory.

### Almond Milk

Grinding Time: 1 min 04 secs

Result: Fine

Suction: Tightly

Our Peach Street took about a minute to blend the almonds into milk. Post-filtering, we noticed a fairly even grinding of the nuts, a key factor that not only contributed to the milk's creamy texture but also ensured optimal nutrition and flavor extraction from the almonds. 

However, the blending process wasn't entirely smooth. The provided blending beaker turned out to be a constraint due to its small capacity, which couldn’t handle the lively blending action, thus causing an overflow each time we moved the blender.  Another contribution to the less-than-ideal experience was the tight suction formed between the blender and the beaker, making it a challenge to lift the wand without causing spills.

### Whipped Egg-Whites

Beating Time: Failed

Result: Failed

Suction: Failed

The success in whipping egg whites lies in the tool's ability to incorporate air, which, in turn, causes the proteins in the egg whites to denature and re-form around the air bubbles, allowing for the formation and stability of stiff peaks. The structure of a whisk, with its numerous thin wires, is tailored for this task. The Peach Street's blending shaft lacks this design, and thus, fails to pass this test. In the end, all we had was a cloudy liquid with two separate layers of bubble film and eggy water, which was far from the desired frothy and stiff peaks that a good whipping process should yield.

The Peach Street makes a colorful entrance with six shade options. Our unit, in a lively shade of green, indeed brought a stylish flair to the countertop. Nonetheless, it shares a common design with most budget blenders, featuring a mid-powered motor, standard two-speed settings, and a typical blade assembly. While these attributes are sufficient for the blender to accomplish basic tasks, they tend to compromise user ease and comfort during operation.

Thus far, the Peach Street's size has proven to be a non-issue. Its compactness is a snug fit even in a crowded drawer, while its lightweight character ensures it's no hassle to handle. The weight is just right—not too heavy to maneuver easily, yet not too light to feel flimsy.

### 7.0 - Build Quality

The Peach Street comes across as a budget-friendly option, and certain aspects of its construction affirm this positioning. 

The motor housing primarily features medium-quality plastic. It showed no scratches after our course of testing. So far, we haven’t noticed any damage on the exterior; our blender still looks shiny and brand new. The blending wand, on the other hand, is crafted from stainless steel. It’s quite solid but lacks a premium feel and the high-polish typically associated with professional-grade or higher-end blenders.

Poor ergonomic design is a notable drawback in immersion blenders, and the Peach Street model sadly falls into this category, marking it as the most uncomfortable blender we have experienced.  The combination of hard-to-activate controls, uncomfortable handling, and inefficient blade design made our blending tasks not only tiresome but exceedingly tedious.

### 5.5 - Ease of Use

The Peach Street may have a simple interface with just two buttons, but it's not user-friendly. The stiff and unresponsive buttons quickly fatigue the fingers, especially when trying to keep the blending shaft from hitting the jar's bottom. Furthermore, the motor's noticeable vibration and the blending shaft's frequent sticking to the container's bottom can be uncomfortable and lead to inconsistent blending results.

### 9.0 - Blade Assembly

Our Peach Street Blender is equipped with accessory ejection buttons located on the motor body, which serve as a convenient feature for controlling the blade detachment process. A swift press on these tactile buttons facilitates the seamless release of the blending shaft from the motor body.

Reattaching the blender is equally hassle-free. All it requires is aligning the shaft with the main housing and pushing them together until a satisfying click signals they've locked securely in place.

### 6.5 - Handling

Designed to fit naturally into the user's hand, the blender’s handle provides a secure and comfortable grip. However, despite the ergonomic design, the overall handling experience leaves much to be desired. The blender’s violent vibration and stiff buttons cause our hands to get tired anyway. 

### 8.5 - Cleanability

The Peach Street's simplistic design lends itself to relatively easy cleaning for non-oily food residues. A quick rinse under running tap water is usually sufficient to dislodge food particles, even from the crevices around the blades. However, when it comes to oily substances like mayonnaise, a bit more effort is needed.
