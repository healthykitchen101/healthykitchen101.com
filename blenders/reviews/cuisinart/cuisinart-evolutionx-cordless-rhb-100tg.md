The Cuisinart RHB-100TG EvolutionX is efficient, versatile, and well-designed. We valued the performance of its blending wand, which ensured smooth, chunk-free smoothies and could turn cooked veggies into creamy soup in seconds. The whisk attachment also proved useful, doing a decent job of beating eggs and making mayonnaise. 

Usability-wise, this RHB-100TG stands out as one of the [most user-friendly blenders](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/immersion-blenders/) in its class. Its intuitive design, complemented by an ergonomic handle, simplifies handling, while the smooth operation of the motor helps minimize hand fatigue and splatters. 

In conclusion, although this blender’s price may be a tad higher compared to other models in its class, the mobility and efficiency it brings to the table make it a worthy investment for any buyer.

**Things We Like**

*   Excellent mobility 
*   Pleasing aesthetic appealing 
*   Included accessories allows for greater versatility  
*   Steady battery performance

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   The blending wand can unintentionally detach

At the time of writing, the RHB-100TG EvolutionX shines as the singular star in Cuisinart’s cordless lineup. Cuisinart markets it as ready for any blending challenge, boasting its portable design, versatile blending modes, and a list of user-friendly accessories as evidence. Also, its design is very distinctive; just a glance and the RHB-100TG EvolutionX stands out among a crowd of generic, conformist machines. 

Still, you might wonder whether this EvolutionX matches up to corded models’ performance or merely a lifeline for on-the-go blends in cramped kitchens. Generally, we think it’s a blend of both—your blender may not be the [powerhouse for heavy-duty blending](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/), yet it’ll get you through everyday blending tasks with ease.

The EvolutionX RHB-100TG is more than meets the eye. 

Although the EvolutionX RHB-100TG didn't rank as the most rapid or potent in our evaluations, it proved to be well-suited for tasks such as grinding nuts and making emulsified sauces, as well as other delicate tasks that require perfectly whipped egg whites. However, be mindful when making frozen fruit smoothies, as it requires a bit more effort than we'd ideally expect.

### Hot Soup Purée

Pureeing Time: 30 seconds

Result: Chunky

Suction: No

In our test, the Cuisinart EvolutionX RHB-100TG attempted to purée hot soup within a strict 30-second timeframe. The result was a soup with a somewhat grainy texture, as evidenced by the notable amount of solids left after straining. This kind of consistency might be favored by some who appreciate a chunkier feel to their soups. However, if it's a seamless purée you're after, you might find yourself needing a bit of patience and extra blending time. Otherwise, alternatives like the [Braun MultiQuick-5](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/braun/braun-multiquick-5-blender/), Ninja Foodi, and [Vitamix](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/vitamix/vitamix-immersion-blender/), will likely be a better fit as they can offer a smoother outcome within the same time constraint.

### Smoothie

" width="300px" height="200px">

Blending Time: 2 minutes

Result: Smooth

Suction: No

While the Cuisinart EvolutionX RHB-100TG didn't burst onto the scene with an overwhelming power during our frozen fruit smoothie test, it eventually triumphed over the challenge. 

The blender initially grappled with the dense kale, taking its time to fully liquify the leafy greens. As we progressed to the frozen fruit layers, the challenge persisted. It demanded for a more assertive user intervention, as without applying some downward pressure, the blender seemed to find it difficult to generate enough force to process the icy fruits. Only when the fruits began to thaw slightly, the blending became more fluid and consistent. As such, the entire process took up to two minutes.

### Mayonnaise

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clqd6up1n0005f5886fzu4i6w.jpg" alt="A batch mayonnaise made by the Cuisinart EvolutionX RHB-100TG immersion blender within 1 minute and 24 seconds. " width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clqd6v55k0006f5882jp30mb9.jpg" alt="Scooping a spoon of mayonnaise made by the Cuisinart EvolutionX RHB-100TG immersion blender." width="300px" height="200px">

Emulsifying Time: 1 min 24 secs

Result: Velvety

Suction: No

Emulsification, at its core, is a delicate procedure that requires both precision and consistency. The RHB-100TG's whisk attachment is thoughtfully designed to address this challenge. Indeed, achieving a robust mayonnaise emulsion in just 90 seconds is no minor achievement. To our surprise, this blender managed it with remarkable ease.

The end result? A mayonnaise that is both dense and luxuriously silken. It holds its form well, suggesting a stable emulsion, yet possesses a smoothness that makes it easily spreadable. This is a balance that's often sought after but not always achieved.

### Almond Milk

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clqd6w5os0007f58852lucp3h.jpg" alt="A white plate of almond pulp and a bowl of milk produced by the Cuisinart EvolutionX RHB-100TG stick blender within 1 minute and 10 seconds." width="300px" height="200px">

Grinding Time: 1 min 10 secs

Result: Very Fine

Suction: No

Our testing of the Ninja Foodi for almond milk preparation was a display of blending efficiency as a creamy and richly flavored almond milk was produced in a rapid 1 minute and 10 seconds. 

However, it’s worth noting that the blending was briefly interrupted by the Foodi's sudden and unexplained shutdowns, not once but multiple times. Although this could signal an overzealous safety feature aimed at motor preservation, the lack of transparency regarding these stops was a mild irritant in an otherwise seamless operation.

### Whipped Egg-Whites

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clqd6xniy0008f5883j435dwq.jpg" alt="A beaker containing beaten egg-white made by the Cuisinart EvolutionX RHB-100TG immersion blender in 1 minute and 45 seconds is put upside down on the table." width="300px" height="200px">

Beating Time: 1 min 45 secs

Result: Stiff

Suction: No

Using the whisking attachment, the device effectively introduced air into the egg whites. This action causes the proteins within the egg whites to unfold and subsequently refold around the introduced air bubbles. As a result, the mixture transforms, and you can distinctly observe the transition of the whites from a translucent liquid to an opaque foam. Minute by minute, the volume increased, with the texture becoming more structured and firm.

Within a concise 1 minute and 45 seconds, the result was evident: stiff peaks with a consistent, glossy finish. The minimal residue at the base of the glass suggests that the blender's reach and circulation were thorough, ensuring even the last traces of liquid egg whites were successfully  turned into the frothy consistency desired.

Width: 2.4" (6.1 cm)

Weight: 1.4 lbs (0.6 kg)

Shaft Length: 8.3" (21.1 cm)

The Cuisinart's dimensions reflect a thoughtful balance between functional design and user comfort. Overall, it stands at 16.2 inches tall, which provides enough height for deep immersion while still fitting comfortably in most kitchen cabinets. At just 1.4 pounds, it is significantly lighter than many of its peers, which definitely ensures minimal arm fatigue, even during heavy-duty tasks like blending rock-solid frozen fruits.

### 8.5 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clqd72aug000af5880f4k404u.jpg" alt="A close-up of the Cuisinart RHB-100TG parts" width="300px" height="200px">

The Cuisinart RHB-100TG is a confluence of style, robustness, and value. Its motor housing is mostly made of medium-grade plastic. Many immersion blenders with plastic components tend to show signs of discoloration or minor damages after prolonged use, but this model stands out with its persistent newness.  Plus, it doesn't feel flimsy or cheap. Instead, it's sturdy and gives a reassuring feel during use. 

The Cuisinart RHB-100TG's blending shaft, on the other hand,  might not have the premium sheen, but its finish is relatively refined, ensuring it doesn't look inferior alongside its peers.

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **8.4**

*   Ease of Use (60%) - **8.0**/10
    
*   Blade Assembly (10%) - **8.5**/10
    
*   Handling (20%) - **9.5**/10
    
*   Cleanability (10%) - **8.5**/10
    

Cuisinart has consistently aimed to enhance user-friendliness across its products over the years, and it largely succeeds with the EvolutionX RHB-100TG, whose cordless design is a game-changer for both blending and cleaning convenience.

### 8.0 - Ease of Use

The Cuisinart EvolutionX RHB-100TG redefines ease of use in the kitchen, thanks to its intuitive design and highly responsive controls. Plus, its motor runs with a gentle hum, eliminating the discomfort of vibrations and allowing for smooth, effortless handling. 

Our tests revealed another advantage: the blender doesn't generate suction, which is often responsible for splashes and uneven blending. This allows for uninterrupted operation and smooth transitions across different speeds, making for an even blend without any spillage or splatter. 

As for the operating system, it's distinctively engineered with a safety-focused mechanism. Unlike conventional blenders, this one incorporates a dual-button activation system. This may introduce a brief learning curve, but once mastered, it provides an added layer of safety that users will undoubtedly appreciate.

### 8.5 - Blade Assembly

To blend, you simply align the motor body housing with the desired attachment—be it the blending shaft or whisk—and twist until a click confirms the connection. The blender itself does not come with the release button, so a simple anti-clockwise twist is enough to detach the accessory from the motor body. However, be mindful that during intensive blending tasks, like processing frozen fruits, applying excessive force to the wand could inadvertently cause it to unscrew and detach from the motor body.

### 9.5 - Handling

With a textured grip, the handle provides a secure, non-slip hold. Its curvature and design mirror the natural contour of a user's hand, enhancing the ergonomic feel and reducing hand fatigue, especially during prolonged use.

### 8.5 - Cleanability

The blade has a smooth surface with minimal crevices, making it easier to wipe away food residues. Yet, its positioning near the housing's base makes its backside less accessible.
