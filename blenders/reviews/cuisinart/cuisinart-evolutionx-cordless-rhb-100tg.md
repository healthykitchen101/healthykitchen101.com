### Hot Soup Purée

Pureeing Time: 30 seconds

Result: Chunky

Suction: No

### Frozen Fruit Smoothie

Blending Time: 2 minutes

Result: Smooth

Suction: No

While the Cuisinart EvolutionX RHB-100TG didn't burst onto the scene with an overwhelming power during our frozen fruit smoothie test, it eventually triumphed over the challenge. 

The blender initially grappled with the dense kale, taking its time to fully liquify the leafy greens. As we progressed to the frozen fruit layers, the challenge persisted. It demanded for a more assertive user intervention, as without applying some downward pressure, the blender seemed to find it difficult to generate enough force to process the icy fruits. Only when the fruits began to thaw slightly, the blending became more fluid and consistent. As such, the entire process took up to two minutes.
