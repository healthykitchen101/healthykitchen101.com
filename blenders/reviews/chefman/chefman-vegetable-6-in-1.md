Overall Verdict
---------------

Overall Score: **6.6**

*   Performance (50%) - **5.8**/10
    
*   Design (20%) - **6.8**/10
    
*   Usability (30%) - **7.8**/10
    

The Chefman 6-in-1 has garnered praise for its affordable price and generous accessory package, but opinions are more split over the quality of its build materials. Regarding its performance testing, the 300-watt motor packed plenty of power to process soft ingredients like root veggies, but it wasn’t sufficient to break down frozen fruits — at least not quickly and efficiently. The whisk attachment did a great job emulsifying mayonnaise and beating egg whites, a capability that’s hard to find in similarly priced immersion blenders. Overall, this Chefman is fine for the price if you’re willing to make compromises when it comes to high-performance blending.

**Things We Like**

*   It can blend frozen fruits, chop vegetables, emulsify sauces, and beat eggs.
*   The motor runs quietly.
*   Its accessory package includes many helpful pieces.
*   The ergonomically-designed handle provides a comfortable grip.

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   The metal blending shaft and whisk damaged our cookware’s surface.

The Chefman 6-in-1 is a [mid-ranged immersion blender](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/immersion-blenders/) with a 300-watt motor and two speed settings. Besides the blending wands, it also includes a couple of extra attachments that come handy for a variety of kitchen tasks, including puréing, emulsifying, pulverizing, and whipping.

Performance: The Lack of Power

performance Scores: **5.8**

*   Hot Soup Purée (35%) - **5.0**/10
    
*   Frozen Fruit Smoothie (30%) - **5.0**/10

The Chefman 6-in-1 worked great for beating eggs and emulsifying mayonnaise. We wish we could say the same when it came to preparing frozen fruit smoothies, puréeing leafy greens, and grinding nuts; it was very mediocre in those tests. For a broader spectrum of blending tasks, we recommend considering other [higher-powered blenders](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/).

### Hot Soup Purée

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla6inqtn001v6s88203h5vl8.jpg" alt="Scooping a spoon of pureéd soup from its full batch in a plastic beaker made by the Chefman Food Prep Kit immersion blender." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9y00zdo00042t885oj464uu.jpg" alt="A batch of soup pureéd by the Chefman Spiralizing Food Prep Kit immersion blender is checked for smoothness by being drained through a stainless steel mesh strainer." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clcomqoai0000fi8863pggcbq.jpg" alt="Chefman Vegetable Slicer 6-in-1 Immersion Blender Hot Soup Purée Test" width="300px" height="200px">

Pureeing Time: 30 seconds

Result: Slightly chunky

Suction: Slightly

We allowed the Chefman 6-in-1 30 seconds worth of runtime for this test and found that it worked just slightly above average for making a purée of root veggies. Our pumpkins and carrots were blended evenly so the soup came out creamy enough to satisfy us. That said, a smattering of celery fibers still remained unprocessed, making the soup coarser than a restaurant-style dish. It might create a smoother texture with more blending time, so this blender is not a bad choice overall.

### Frozen Fruit Smoothie

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9y023f300052t88gw73bmhq.jpg" alt="A plastic beaker containing a batch of green smoothie whose parts are scooped with a stainless steel spoon is between the Chefman Vegetable Slicer 6-in-1 Immersion Blender motor body and a smartphone displaying the total blending time (2 minutes and 30 seconds)." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9y02cmm00062t88dpzodeqp.jpg" alt="After finishing blending, the green smoothie made by the Chefman hand blender was spread evenly throughout a white paper to check for solid chunks." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9zg48pw0001b288hz8d6bkg.jpg" alt="Chefman Vegetable Slicer 6-in-1 Immersion Blender Smoothie Test" width="300px" height="200px">

Blending Time: 2 mins 30 secs

Result: Smooth

Suction: Slightly

We were skeptical whether this blender had enough power to churn through solid ingredients like frozen fruits. In the end, however, it did surprisingly well. It was hard not to notice tiny flakes of kale in the final result, but most of us agree that they didn’t harm the smoothie’s texture. 

The trade off was blending time. While sporting the same motor power as its counterparts, such as the [Braun MutiQuick-5](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/braun/braun-multiquick-5-blender/) or the [BELLA 10-Speed](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/bella/bella-10-speed/), the Chefman 6-in-1 somehow took a full minute more to create equivalent results. Blenders that work faster create a creamier texture because the icy fruit doesn’t have a chance to thaw. The Chefman’s smoothie tasted more diluted.

### Mayonnaise

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9y03a5q00072t88en6ndkzk.jpg" alt="Scooping a spoon of mayonnaise from its full batch made by the Chefman immersion blender and contained in a plastic beaker that stands between the Chefman’s motor and a smartphone displaying the total mixing time ( 1 minute and 30 seconds)." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9y03qsj00082t8829j4gvg2.jpg" alt="Scooping a spoon of mayonnaise from its full batch in a plastic beaker made by the Chefman corded hand blender." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9zia9pr0003b288da8r2twf.jpg" alt="Chefman Vegetable Slicer 6-in-1 Immersion Blender Mayonnaise Test" width="300px" height="200px">

Emulsifying Time: 1 min 30 secs

Result: Smooth

Suction: Yes

For this test, we combined three egg yolks with 240 ml canola oil. This blender took a minute and a half to turn it into pleasant yellowish mayo which had a creamy, fluffy texture that would work well in a variety of dishes. All in all, using the Chefman 6-in-1 to make mayonnaise is a quick-and-easy process, and the same should be true for any other emulsified sauces.

### Almond Milk

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9y04nne00092t8802p53oe3.jpg" alt="A white plate of almond pulp produced by the Chefman corded stick blender being between the Chefman’s motor body and a smartphone displaying the total grinding time (1 minute and 50 seconds)." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9zicdi30004b288at948pv5.jpg" alt="Chefman Vegetable Slicer 6-in-1 Immersion Blender Almond Milk Test" width="300px" height="200px">

Grinding Time: 1 min 50 secs

Result: Coarse

Suction: Tightly

The Chefman 6-in-1 created a serving of non-dairy milk in nearly two minutes. It didn’t blend as finely as some other blenders, such as the [Chefman Cordless](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/chefman/chefman-cordless/), so the drink it produced was neither the creamiest nor the richest in almond flavor. Nevertheless, this blender can still get the job done and help you skip store-bought versions. It’s always nice to set yourself up for fresher alternatives right at home.

### Whipped Egg-Whites

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9y062ed000a2t880saj0crn.jpg" alt="The plastic beaker containing testing beaten egg-white of the Chefman immersion blender is put upside down on the white table with its motor body and a smartphone displaying the total whipping time (1 minute and 29seconds) by its sides." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9y06bch000b2t88e0kjgzdn.jpg" alt="Looking at the beaten egg-white of the Chefman Stick Blender contained inside a plastic beaker." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla24nsmb00006s88d7cje49p.jpg" alt="Chefman Vegetable Slicer 6-in-1 Immersion Blender Whipped Egg-Whites Test" width="300px" height="200px">

Beating Time: 1 min 30 secs

Result: Stiff

Suction: No

Our eggs turned into an airy, fluffy foam that was stiff enough to stick to the bowl’s sides. Even when we turned the foam upside down, it didn’t fall out. Indeed, this blender’s whisk attachment made meringue a simple and fun exercise.

Design: Standard Quality
------------------------

design Scores: **6.8**

*   Build Quality (60%) - **7.0**/10
    
*   Blending Shaft (30%) - **7.0**/10
    
*   Power cord (5%) - **10**/10
    
*   Beaker (5%) - **0**/10
    

The Chefman 6-in-1 has a hard plastic body, giving it a light, balanced weight. All the parts are designed well for the price, but they don't look really opulent. They have much in common with other blenders in this price range, so nothing in particular makes this one stand out.

### In the Box

### Dimensions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/claakrmrq0002mn88bdviae7d.jpg" alt="The Chefman hand-held blender standing on top of its blending shaft on a gray table, with the length of the blending shaft being noted to the side as 7.9 inches, and the total length of the unit as 14.6 inches." width="300px" height="200px">

Height: 14.6" (37.1 cm)

Width: 2.5" (6.4 cm)

Weight: 1.5 lbs (0.7 kg)

Shaft Length: 7.9" (20.1 cm)

This Chefman device is the same size as most hand blenders, so it should be comfortable for most people to use, even for extended periods. So far, we haven’t encountered any challenges caused by its length or weight.

### 7.0 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9y08dy9000d2t885iuebjlz.jpg" alt="The blending wand and motor body of the Chefman blender lying side by side on a white table." width="300px" height="200px">

The Chefman 6-in-1’s medium-grade construction may not impress you, but we assure it is durable enough for regular use. The blending attachments all attach securely to the motor body, so they’re unlikely to separate while in operation. Like us, you may not like the metal blade housing which will easily scratch your cookware’s surface. For better or worse, though, it's a common feature to help avoid food splatter.

### Speed and Controls

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9y09cc9000e2t883mlu6xbm.jpg" alt="A close-up of two speed settings of the Chefman corded blender." width="300px" height="200px">

Activation: Press

Min Speed: 10,479 RPM

Max Speed: 13,211 RPM

Presets: No

Noise Level: 72 dB

Digital Display: No

Pulse Mode: Yes

This blender runs at two different speeds. The two buttons on the front allow you to shift between speed options. Both are quite responsive and the motor accelerates seamlessly. We noticed a clear change in the blade’s rotation speed, but it wasn’t jarring.

### 7.0 - Blending Shaft

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9y0a557000f2t88frjv9e54.jpg" alt="A close-up of the stainless steel blade assembly featuring two prongs of the Chefman blender." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Stainless steel

Type: Sharp blade

Guard Material: Stainless steel

Blade Count: 2

Removable: No

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

The blending shaft is sensibly built with a two-prong blade assembly. The blades look sturdy, but their metal housing somehow wound up with several black dots after our rigorous testing procedure. The blade housing is meant to keep splashing to a minimum, but it has room for improvement. It still allowed some liquid to squirt through the openings on the sides.

### Failed - Beaker

Material:  N/A

Capacity: NaN fl oz (NaN ml)

Measurements:  N/A

Weight: NaN oz (NaN g)

Height: NaN" (NaN cm)

Dishwasher Safe:  N/A

The Chefman 6-in-1 doesn’t come with a blending beaker.

### 10 - Power cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9y0bznh000g2t88046w2d7s.jpg" alt="The Chefman Immersion Blender on a white table with its power cord that features a 2-prong plug rolled up next to it." width="300px" height="200px">

Cord Length: 5.3 ft (1.6 m)

Type: 2-prong plug

Detachable: No

The power cord has a reasonable length so you can easily plug it into any nearby outlet. We like its small loop as this add-on allows us to hang the whole blender on a hook for easy storage.

### Extra Accessories: Whisk Attachment

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9y0cskv000h2t88f9syh6dj.jpg" alt="The Chefman 6-in-1 Immersion Blender Whisk Attachment lying flat on a white table." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Removable: Yes

The whisk attachment will turn your blender into a hand mixer for light whipping tasks like beating egg whites, whipping cream, and emulsifying sauces.

### Extra Accessories: Chopper Attachment

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9y0e7si000j2t88edcrcqeq.jpg" alt="The Chefman 6-in-1 Immersion Blender Chopper Attachment standing on a white table. " width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic and stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Removable: Yes

We haven't performed any tests on the chopper attachment, so we can't say for sure how well it works. Considering the blender’s power rating, however, it should be capable of chopping small quantities of fresh veggies or raw nuts.

### Extra Accessories: Spiralizer Attachment

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9y0ff1x000k2t8812i6gi74.jpg" alt="The Chefman 6-in-1 Immersion Blender Spiralizer Attachment standing on a white table. " width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clbnfsfvt002c9t886gbf7o2m.jpg" alt="Three Spiralizing Blades of the Chefman Food Prep Kit Immersion Blender being side by side on a white table." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic and stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Removable: Yes

The accessory package includes a spiralizer attachment with three blade discs so you can turn your vegetables into noodles. We haven't tested the blades, but they all look like helpful add-ons.

Usability: Quite Refined to Blend
---------------------------------

usability Scores: **7.8**

*   Ease of Use (60%) - **7.6**/10
    
*   Blade Assembly (10%) - **9.0**/10
    
*   Handling (20%) - **7.5**/10
    
*   Cleanability (10%) - **8.5**/10
    

The balanced weight and simple controls make this blender a breeze to use, and its ergonomically-designed handle means that it’ll fit comfortably in your palm. Sometimes it’s difficult to maneuver, though, since it can create quite a bit of suction at the bottom of the container.

### 7.6 - Ease of Use

This Chefman is perfectly comfortable to use one-handed. The buttons are relatively stiff, but they’re responsive and do give us a good sense of control. 

In our tests, this blender acted like a vacuum at the bottom of the beaker, so we got some splatter whenever we moved it around. If the container’s sides were tall enough, though, our blending experience would have been notably better. 

Food tends to cling to the blade guard’s holes. As a result, you’ll probably need to use a food scraper to clean it up every now and then.

### 9.0 - Blade Assembly

The Chefman 6-in-1 features a simple locking mechanism so blending attachments are very easy to attach or remove. To connect them, you simply insert the motor body into the attachment, then twist until the two units click together.

### 7.5 - Handling

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9y0khlg000l2t88gu239yg1.jpg" alt="Someone is holding the Chefman’s handle with one hand." width="300px" height="200px">

The handle doesn’t have a grippy silicon layer like some, but it is ergonomically designed to ensure a comfortable grip, which eases hand fatigue while you’re blending. We can’t call this Chefman the most practical blender out there, but it shouldn’t cause problems.

### 8.5 - Cleanability

All the pieces are safe to put in the dishwasher except for the motor body. Unless you’re short on time, however, you’ll want to wash them manually — they’ll last longer that way. 

We cleaned the blending wand and the whisk attachment by hand and appreciated how easily food tailings wiped away. The only inconveniences were the blades’ backsides which we found quite difficult to get our hands into; you will need a bottle brush to simplify cleanup.
