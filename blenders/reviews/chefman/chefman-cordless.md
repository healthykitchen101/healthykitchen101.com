Overall Verdict
---------------

Overall Score: **8.0**

*   Performance (50%) - **7.7**/10
    
*   Design (20%) - **7.4**/10
    
*   Usability (30%) - **8.8**/10
    

The Chefman cordless is our [favorite blender](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/immersion-blenders/) even when it wasn’t up to the task of beating eggs. We can’t say for sure whether you’ll love its soup-making capability since it performed just moderately in our pureéing test.

Nevertheless, if you’re seeking the best cordless immersion blender for your frozen fruit smoothies, you don't have to look far because this Chefman might have an adequate power for your daily whole-food consumption. It is also a decent pick that will allow you to make a quick, easy mayonnaise or to experiment with different nut pairings for your non-dairy milk. 

Efficiency aside, we’d rate the build quality and materials as average, but they somehow add a touch of elegance not found with similarly-priced models. Other nice extras include the indicator LED light, shaft-release button, and safety mechanism. 

In conclusion, although the Chefman cordlesscosts a little more than other immersion blenders in its class, the efficiency and excellent mobility it provides are well worth it.

**Things We Like**

*   The lock function helps prevent accidental operation, reducing the likelihood of personal injury. 
*   It feels like a fancy blender.
*   Multiple speed options allow for a wide range of tasks. 
*   It is capable of pulverizing frozen fruit and making mayonnaise.
*   Colored LED ring indicates the battery’s status accurately.
*   All the buttons are easy to control.
*   An included cookware guard keeps pots and pans scratch-free.

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   It is unable to whip eggs due to the lack of a whisk attachment

In the growing market of cordless immersion blenders, the Chefman stands out for its quick-charging battery, advanced safety technology, and a top speed of 15,000 RPM. As we learned from our early testing, though, none of the machines in this class perform particularly well. Nonetheless, we still expected this blender to stand out because it looks and feels impressive for the price.

Performance: Good enough
------------------------

performance Scores: **7.7**

*   Hot Soup Purée (35%) - **7.0**/10
    
*   Frozen Fruit Smoothie (30%) - **9.0**/10
    
*   Mayonnaise (15%) - **8.8**/10
    
*   Almond Milk (15%) - **8.5**/10
    
*   Whipped Egg-Whites (5%) - **0**/10
    

The Chefman is a moderately [capable blender](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/). With stable battery power, it brings quite a lot to the table. In our tests, it didn’t work particularly quickly, nor were the results among the best, but based on its testing performance, we’re confident that the capabilities of this blender extend beyond soup, smoothies, and mayonnaise.

### Hot Soup Purée

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla9gacae00002r88441se3i2.jpg" alt="The Chefman Cordless Immersion Blender Hot Soup Purée Test" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla6ir5zz001w6s883hgmfs5y.jpg" alt="Scooping a spoon of pureéd soup from its full batch in a plastic beaker made by the Chefman battery-powered immersion blender." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9rvlcjq000oq5889mfacguu.jpg" alt="A batch of soup pureéd by the Chefman cordless blender is checked for smoothness by being drained through a stainless steel mesh strainer." width="300px" height="200px">

Pureeing Time: 30 seconds

Result: Smooth

Suction:  Slightly

The Chefman managed to create a serving of hot soup in 30 seconds. The soup wasn’t puréed to perfection since there was still a considerable amount of food flakes left behind, but for the most part, we were pleased with its smoothness. If you prefer your purée to be smoother, blend longer. (Or consider other models like the [Vitamix 5-speed](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/vitamix/vitamix-immersion-blender/), the [Braun MultiQuick-5](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/braun/braun-multiquick-5-blender/), and the [KitchenAid cordless](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/kitchenaid/kitchenaid-khbbv53/) hand blender.)

### Frozen Fruit Smoothie

Blending Time: 1 min 10 secs

Result: Smooth

Suction: No

At the highest speed setting, our Chefman broke down all the ingredients quite easily — better and faster, in fact, than we expected from a blender in this segment. The test smoothie came out with a satisfying texture, combining smooth, pulverized fruits with the green of kale for a nice, chilled mouthfeel.

### Mayonnaise

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla9gc6r900022r88aqwk61jf.jpg" alt="The Chefman Cordless Immersion Blender Mayonnaise Test" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9rvns1l000rq5885uzy8r13.jpg" alt="Scooping a spoon of mayonnaise from its full batch made by the Chefman cordless stick blender and contained in a plastic beaker that stands between the Chefman’s motor and a smartphone displaying the total mixing time (1 minute and 30 seconds).

Emulsifying Time: 1 min 30 secs

Result: Smooth

Suction: No

Emulsifying with the blending shaft, this Chefman cordless blender passed the mayonnaise test within a minute and a half, which was slightly faster than average. The final mayonnaise looked smooth and was well emulsified, sharing a similar texture with those produced by a whisk attachment, such as the [Cuisinart’s](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/cuisinart/cuisinart-csb-175/).

### Almond Milk

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla9gd1fs00032r88bnd1dfo7.jpg" alt="The Chefman Cordless Immersion Blender Almond Milk Test" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9rvp8hp000tq588fndba94h.jpg" alt="A white plate of almond pulp produced by the Chefman battery-powered stick blender being between the Chefman’s motor body and a smartphone displaying the total grinding time (55 seconds)." width="300px" height="200px">

Grinding Time: 1 min 10 secs

Result: Very Fine

Suction: Yes

The Chefman cordless device may not be a bad option when you’re making nut milk. Just make sure to use a blending beaker with sufficient capacity. 

Our drink was creamy and packed with characteristic almond flavor so we think you will love it as much as we do. During our test, the blender did, unfortunately, suction itself to the beaker's bottom, causing the mixture to splatter every time we moved the blending wand. However, this wasn’t only about the suction — things would work better if we used a larger beaker.

### Whipped Egg-Whites

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cla9gi62000052r88gsj01nji.jpg" alt="The Chefman Cordless Immersion Blender Whipped Egg-Whites Test" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9rvqp6a000vq588e2ub9r8v.jpg" alt="Someone is holding a plastic beaker which contains a batch of failed beaten egg-white of the Chefman immersion blender and is between the Chefman’s motor body and a smartphone displaying the total whipping time (2 minutes 2 seconds)." width="300px" height="200px">

Beating Time: N/A

Result: N/A

Suction: N/A

This machine’s blending shaft was unable to beat the eggs, but it shares this shortcoming with most blending shafts. If you want your machine to properly whip the eggs, we recommend choosing one that comes with a whisk attachment, such as the [KOIOS 4-in-1](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/koios/koios-4-in-1-immersion/). A whisk’s many thin wires will uncurl the protein strands of the egg whites and incorporate air into them. That way, stiff eggy peaks are able to form and stay stable.

Design: Pleasing Collection of Features
---------------------------------------

design Scores: **7.4**

*   Build Quality (60%) - **8.0**/10
    
*   Blending Shaft (30%) - **7.0**/10
    
*   Battery (5%) - **10**/10
    
*   Beaker (5%) - **0**/10
    

We like the look of this blender, especially the color-coded LED ring on top. It lights up during operation to create a fancy blending experience. The overall quality is fine with all parts coming as standard. However, we did have a few reservations about the blades’ metal housing, which presents some shortcomings that you may feel uncomfortable with.

### In the Box

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9rvs3qc000wq588b6mf6emb.jpg" alt="An owner manual, USB cord, charger adapter, immersion blending wand with its motor body attached, blade edge guard, blade guard, and paper cartoon box of The Chefman cordless hand blender being side by side on a white table." width="300px" height="200px">

*   Motor body 
*   Blending shaft 
*   Blade guard
*   Blade edge guard
*   Charger adapter & USB cord 
*   User manual

Beyonds the two main components, the Chefman also comes with a pot & pan guard to prevent scratches on your cookware and a blade guard so you can cover the blade entirely while your blender is not in use.

### Dimensions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/claakjkfz0000mn888ccsh1d3.jpg" alt="The Chefman cordless immersion blender standing on top of its blending shaft on a gray table, with the length of the blending shaft being noted to the side as 8.2 inches, and the total length of the unit as 16.4 inches." width="300px" height="200px">

Height: 16.4" (41.7 cm)

Width: 2.3" (5.8 cm)

Weight: 1.4 lbs (0.6 kg)

Shaft Length: 8.2" (20.8 cm)

This Chefman is the right size to fit comfortably in your palm. At 1.4 pounds, it is a bit on the light side, but so are most immersion blenders that are made of standard plastic.

### 8.0 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9rvt0gj000xq5883os87ajv.jpg" alt="The Chefman’s blending shaft and motor body lying on a white table." width="300px" height="200px">

The Chefman provides a medium level of quality at a very reasonable price. With a black-clad exterior all around, the motor looks charming and notably elegant. After a course of testing, we found a smattering of tiny scratches around this part, but they’re not too noticeable unless you look closely.

### Speed and Controls

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9rvumyt000zq58857qkgxro.jpg" alt="A close-up of the variable speed control button on the front interface of the Chefman cordless stick blender." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9rvtw4a000yq58806pa4w6c.jpg" alt="A close-up of the safety lock button and the USB port  on the rear of the Chefman cordless hand blender.

Activation: Press

Min Speed: 10,500 RPM

Max Speed: 14,333 RPM

Presets: No

Noise Level: 72 dB

Digital Display: No

Pulse Mode: No

You control this blender’s multiple speeds by varying the pressure on the trigger switch in front. The harder you press, the faster the blade will spin. There is also the safety lock button on the device’s rear. Both buttons must be engaged before the motor will turn. Fortunately, both of them are very sensitive, so you won’t need much pressure to get the job done. 

Your Chefman doesn’t have a pulse function, but you can still chop food evenly by pressing and releasing the buttons in short intervals.

### 7.0 - Blending Shaft

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9rvwwkk0012q588ez4s1quz.jpg" alt="A close-up of the blade assembly featuring two sharp prongs of the Chefman battery-powered blender." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9rvx8580013q5880yg5f87h.jpg" alt="The immersion blending shaft with its blade guard attached of the Chefman cordless blender lying flat on a white table." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cl9rvxkf10014q588cqm54g91.jpg" alt="A close-up of the Chefman’s blending shaft with its blade guard attached." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Stainless steel

Type: Sharp blade

Guard Material: Stainless steel

Blade Count: 2

Removable: No

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

The whole blending shaft is made of standard stainless steel, but after several uses, we nevertheless found a small rust spot on the blade guard. We’ve tested a myriad of immersion blenders and noticed that rust is rare. We can’t say for sure whether the rust will spread, but if it does, the machine’s integrity and appearance will be severely impaired. 

The level of craftsmanship of the blade guard is okay overall but it could stand some improvements. The holes in the guard, for instance, look non-uniform and slightly misshapen. 

The blade has two prongs: one is sharp and the other is dull. It’s sturdy enough to puree nearly all kinds of soft foods. It can even make quick work of emulsifying, so you can prepare mayonnaise or any other sauce that needs a creamy, stable base.

### Failed - Beaker

Material: N/A

Capacity: NaN fl oz (NaN ml)

Measurements: N/A

Weight: NaN oz (NaN g)

Height: NaN" (NaN cm)

Dishwasher Safe: N/A

The set doesn’t include a blending beaker, but you can purchase this add-on from any retailer.

Charger Length: 3.6 ft.

After a full 2-hour charging session, the battery will hold enough power for 18-20 minutes of blending. The LED ring on the top shows the battery level or charging status. It will be a steady blue while the charge is above 50%, but when the battery drains down to below that point, it will turn orange or red before powering off. Note that you can also use your blender for a quick task without charging it to 100%.

### Extra Accessories: Not Included

Material: N/A

Dishwasher Safe: N/A

Removable: N/A

No extra blending attachments are included.

Usability: Excellent Mobility
-----------------------------

usability Scores: **8.8**

*   Ease of Use (60%) - **8.8**/10
    
*   Blade Assembly (10%) - **9.5**/10
    
*   Handling (20%) - **9.0**/10
    
*   Cleanability (10%) - **8.0**/10
    

The Chefman’s usability is great. There’s no cord to accidentally yank on, allowing for maximum flexibility while blending. With the balanced size, it isn’t cumbersome, creating a comfortable experience even when you're pureeing a large batch.

### 8.8 - Ease of Use

Maneuvering the Chefman is particularly easy and usually doesn’t splatter ingredients around. With the exception of the almond milk test, we didn’t have much trouble with our blending motions; this blender suctioned itself only lightly to the beaker’s bottom. 

Most of our testers also praised its pressure-sensitive speed controller, though a few got frustrated trying to switch between mid-range speeds. Either way, it does take some time to get a feel for the speed controls. 

The removable plastic guard covers the metal blade housing to minimize scratches on your pots and pans. With it in place, you can be less timid with your motions.

### 9.5 - Blade Assembly

The shaft-release button not only helps reinforce the connection between the motor housing and the blending wand, but it also allows for easier disassembly. Simply press this button and pull the blending wand to separate the two parts. Setting up the blender is straightforward as well; align the motor body housing with the blending shaft and push them together until you hear them click.

### 9.0 - Handling

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clbnfeq3t002b9t88783l87o6.jpg" alt="Someone is holding the Chefman’s immersion handle and at the same time pressing its variable speed control button, with one hand." width="300px" height="200px">

Our Chefman let us blend in comfort thanks to the ergonomically designed handle. It didn’t get slippery even when our hands were oily during the mayonnaise test. The stable grip it provides is meaningful, especially if your hands fatigue quickly.

### 8.0 - Cleanability

All removable parts are top-rack dishwasher safe, but we prefer to clean them by hand since it’s faster and practically effortless. Following each test, we scrubbed away the food tailings with a soapy sponge. Most of the residue rinsed off easily, including the bits stuffed up behind the blades.
