The La Reveuse gets our recommendation for its balance of price versus capability. It is a fairly average personal blender that doesn’t excel in pulverizing raw nuts or dried fruits, but will have you covered if your ideas of beverages include fresh plant-based food. It’s even impressively capable of making frozen fruit smoothies and fibrous greens mixtures. Just noted that your La Reveuse has taken some lumps for being not as speedy as its [higher-powered competitor](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/).

Overall quality comes standard across the lineup with all plastic components except for the blade assembly. Regarding its durability, we have nothing to report as of yet. We just haven't had the blender long enough for anything to go wrong, or perhaps, our blender itself is sturdy enough to withstand the rigors of testing.

**Things We Like**

*   Extra blending cup and twist-on travel lid make this blender perfect for those who are always on the go.
*   It boasts a consistent and dependable performance. 
*   The motor doesn’t struggle much to handle frozen fruits. 
*    User-friendly design allows for easy control and operation.

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   The narrow design makes the blending cup tricky to clean. 
*   The blending cup's small opening makes it quite messy to add food, especially powders.

As a [standard personal blender](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/personal-blenders/), the La Reveuse may not be very exciting to use, or even to look at, but it’s comparably priced for the amount of features you’ll get. Is this blender a bargain because of that or does it conspiracy to fool you by the price? We just bought one to test for several months to find out.

In our test, the 300-watt motor of this blender was just sufficient for smooth blends of frozen fruit smoothies and fibrous mixtures. It didn’t mix protein shake as evenly as the counterparts. It also fell short in crushing ice cubes, though this appears to be the case with most mid-powered personal blenders. If you want more capabilities than what the La Reveuse offers, there are the [Ninja Fit](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/ninja/ninja-qb3001ss-fit/), [NutriBullet](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/nutribullet/nutribullet-900-watt-pro/), and the [Ninja BN401 Nutri](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/ninja/ninja-bn401-nutri-pro/).

### Protein Shake

" width="300px" height="200px">

Blending Time: 1 min 21 secs

Result: Coarse

The La Reveuse took nearly one minute and a half to liquify entirely 0.75 ounces oatmeal. This was averagely fast across the class. By the time the oatmeal was smooth, however, there was a little bit of partially-blended almonds. More disappointingly, a large smattering of dried blueberries even remained almost entirely intact. After much practice, it should break down a part of the dried fruits rather than just turn them all around, to say the least. For the most part, we agree our protein shake would come out silkier if we have the food blended a bit longer. But within the same blending time, the [BELLA](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/bella/bella-rocket-blender-bla13586/)— did work much more efficiently.

### Frozen Fruit Smoothie

" width="300px" height="200px">

Blending Time: 1 mins 20 seconds

Result: Silky Smooth

Let's start with what we weren't happy with: the demand for cup shaking, even though we were pretty sure this is a common occurrence with most mid-range blenders. Except for this, we were entirely won over by its performance considering that around this budget, there is rarely a single-serve blender that can turn frozen food into liquid form as smoothly. 

To produce a batch of smoothie, in particular, the La Reveuse took 1 minute and 20 seconds. That's quicker than the [Icucina](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/icucina/icucina-portable-bullet-hl2576/), [Oster](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/oster/oster-blstpb-wbl/), and [Black+Decker,](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/black-decker/black-decker-fusionblade/) but a little slower than some other top competitors, such as the [Ninja BL480D Nutri](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/ninja/ninja-bl480d-nutri/). Since the smoothie was well-made, it packed a harmonious balance of sweet and tangy flavors. Every sip is a burst of rejuvenation, satisfying both our taste buds and thirst. 

A good personal blender for frozen fruit smoothies, the La Reveuse is certainly a favorite for anyone looking for quick morning pick-me-up or post-workout refreshment, in conclusion.

### Fibrous Greens

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cldshecvh000xiy88b3wj5qfs.jpg" alt="La Reveuse Personal Blender Fibrous Greens Test" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cldscjjvg000fiy8888gy9ebr.jpg" alt="A glass of water with fibrous green pulp produced by the La Reveuse sinking from its top to bottom.

Blending Time: 20 seconds

Result: Fine

This blending process was allowed to last in 20 seconds since we learned through our research that this duration was enough to help us find a true master at producing smooth and nutrient-rich drinks from delicate greens.

More than a surprise, the La Reveuse was among the top-performing blenders, churning out a mixture that made the most out of the greens’s flavor and nutrients. It even performed on par with rivals whose price tag is almost twice as much, including the Ninja BL480D Nutri. 

Our fibrous mixture got a vibrant green color with just a small smattering of pulp left behind. It would be more impressive if we let the blender work for longer. Considering this, the La Reveuse is sure to hit the spot whether you're a health-conscious individual or simply like to enjoy high-quality green smoothies everyday.

### Crushed Ice Cubes

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cldshfdw9000yiy8812fe8sn0.jpg" alt="La Reveuse Personal Blender Crushed Ice Test" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cldsclig5000hiy884nqb29zl.jpg" alt="The La Reveuse left behind 5.13 oz unblended ice (Cre: Nguyen Ntk/HealthyKitchen101)" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cldscmh0n000iiy888w4cgz5v.jpg" alt="A black tray of crushed ice produced by the La Reveuse Personal Blender being on a table." width="300px" height="200px">

Ice Fineness: Coarse

Unblended Ice: 85.5% of 6 oz

The ability to crush ice cubes is made possible by the strength of the blender's motor and blades. With an only 300-watt motor and a moderately-built blade assembly, as such, the La Reveuse failed to deliver the result we expected. Even when we’d tried to shake the cup vigorously multiple times, there was no way that our blender could break down the ice cubes into smaller pieces.

The La Reveuse is built for the price with a basic set of features. Its simplicity is a big draw, but the lack of upscale feel ultimately holds it back. To be blunt, the plastic housing feels cheap and does not give a sense of durability. We had hoped for a blender that was not only efficient but also visually appealing, but this one falls short in drawing attention to itself. There is a lot of room for improvement should this blender want to become competitive with its peers. Sharing the same kind of styling, the Oster or the Black+Decker looks more eye-catching and beautifully sportier.

Height: 13.7" (34.8 cm)

Width: 4.9" (12.4 cm)

Weight: 2.0 lbs (0.9 kg)

### 7.0 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cldsgko2n000liy887uoaep9b.jpg" alt="The motor base and blending cup of the La Reveuse single-serve blender lying side by side on a table." width="300px" height="200px">

Efficient and affordable, the La Reveuse is likely to provide a cost-effective solution. However, this budget-friendly option comes with some sacrifices in terms of overall quality and blending comfort. The blender's design is simple and does not stand out so you won’t be impressed at a glance, but this can be improved by enhancing the front interface to make it more visually appealing. For construction, it exhibits a mix of quality materials, but most of them are medium-grade and sturdy enough to justify the price. 

In conclusion, on design alone, this blender is pretty lackluster. Nevertheless, it seems to fit the bill should you prioritize functionality over aesthetics.

### 6.0 - Blades

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cldsglkg6000miy885kkv20n4.jpg" alt="A close-up of the La Reveuse blade assembly." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cldsgm4xw000niy88hfug4vqy.jpg" alt="A close-up of the underside of the La Reveuse blade assembly" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Stainless Steel

Type: Cross

Blade Count: 4

Removable: No

Dishwasher Safe: No

The blade features 4 prongs. This means it may blend faster and smoother than those with only 2 prongs. That said, it lacks the thickness and sharpness that we usually get from those of premium models. It doesn’t match their quality, either. We can’t say for sure whether the blade is suitable for processing dry ingredients, but of the 4 prongs, two prongs are dull and the others are sharp, which suggests that both dry and wet blends might be possible.

### Motor Base

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cldsgneqb000oiy88218j3vml.jpg" alt="A close-up of the La Reveuse motor base" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cldsgo2d1000piy886ngbawi5.jpg" alt="A close-up of the motor base and power cord of the La Reveuse" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cldsgowdv000qiy886o7q32d1.jpg" alt="A close-up of the motor base and power plug of the La Reveuse" width="300px" height="200px">

Rated Voltage: 120 V

Rated Power: 300 Watt

Working Time: ≤ 1 minute

Protection: N/A

Weight: 1.7 lbs (0.8 kg)

Cord Length: 2.6 ft (0.8 m)

Extra Feature: Rubber suction feet

We find the motor is less likely to overheat like most of its counterparts, including the Magic Bullet. It shouldn’t be operated continuously for more than one minute per interval since this will result in permanent damages.

There are four suction feet made of rubber on the motor’s bottom. They have a nice grip of smooth surface, allowing the blender to stand firmly and reduce the risk of spills during operations. Together with a cooling fan, they also help the blender avoid overheating by allowing some airflow to the motor.

### 10 - Blending Cup

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cldsgr3fb000riy884sqe8kzj.jpg" alt="Two blending cups of the La Reveuse personal blender standing on a table, with the measurements written to the side (2.9x9x2.9 inches). " width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/cldsgv9ge000uiy882b95am8m.jpg" alt="The La Reveuse Lid" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic

Capacity: 18 ounces

Weight: 0.3 lb

Dishwasher Safe: No

Measurement: No

Suitable For: Small batches

Accessories: To-go lids

Our La Reveuse is shipped with two blending cups that can be used interchangeably with the single blade assembly. Having an extra blending cup makes this blender a more worthy pickup since such a feature can be pricey extras.

We appreciate that both the cups fit tightly with the supplied lids so you can enjoy your drinks on the go without leakage. Another highlight is that the lids allow you to take a sip straight from the cup thanks to the flip-top spout. They are easy to screw on and remove from the cups as well.

### Speed and Controls

Activation: Twist

Min Speed: N/A

Max Speed: 20,018 RPM

Presets: No

Noise Level: 97 dB

Digital Display: No

Pulse Mode: No

The La Reveuse has only one speed. While this may make it a little bit harder to fine-tune the consistency of your blends (when you want a coarser or finer pureé, or a smooth or chunky salsa), it’s great for those who want a straightforward blending experience.

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **NaN**

*   Hands-Free Operation (60%) - **9.3**/undefined
    
*   Assembly (20%) - **10**/undefined
    
*   Cleanability (20%) - **8.0**/undefined
    

The design is very intuitive so finding how this blender works didn’t take us much time at all. There is only one speed option, but we found it was rather easy to get pulse mode by pressing and releasing the cup in short intervals. Hand washing the cup and the blade’s backsides was challenging particularly due to their styling, but if you have a cleaning brush available, you’ll get all things spackling again in no time.

### 9.3 - Hands-Free Operation

The La Reveuse should appeal to the buyers with its convenient hands-free operation feature. Unlike many rivals, the blender itself can work without demanding you to press and continuously hold the blending cup throughout the blending process; once the cup is locked in place, your blender will be activated and blend until being removed from the motor. 

For a smooth blend, cup shaking may be necessary if your beverage contains tough ingredients that can impede the blade's spinning. As smoothly as it performed in the smoothie test, however, we do believe your blender can handle certain sorts of blends without excessive hand involvement.

During our tests, in particular, the only instance where the blade became jammed was when blending frozen fruits. This required a temporary stop to shake the blender. However, compared to other machines that needed 4-6 shakes to achieve even blending, this was a relatively minor inconvenience.

### 10 - Assembly

Assembling a blender with clear and concise instructions like the La Reveuse is a comfortable experience. The straightforward design makes it a breeze to put all the components together. You simply screw the blade assembly to the blending cup first and then insert it to the motor base by lining up the tabs on the outside of the cup with the opening at the edges of the hole on the motor base. To blend, press down on the cup consecutively, but a quick, clockwise turn will lock the cup into place for hands-free operation. 

Disassembling the blender is easy, too. Just remove the cup from the base and unscrew the extractor blade. For added convenience, you can then replace the blade assembly with the spill-proof travel lid if you plan to take your drink on the go.

Once blending finishes, you can take your drink on the go by taking the cup out from the base and then switch the blade out for the spill-proof travel lid. This also serves as a method of disassembling the blender.

### 8.0 - Cleanability

All the pieces, including the blending cup, blade assembly, and travel lids, are not dishwasher-safe so we cleaned them manually with warm, soapy water. The narrow blending cup and its opening made it quite difficult to get our fingers inside, especially for those with big hands. We also encountered frustrations in cleaning the silicone gadget and the blade’s undersides. To make cleaning easier, consider investing in additional cleaning tools, such as a specialized bottle brush or a tool designed to clean the blade.
