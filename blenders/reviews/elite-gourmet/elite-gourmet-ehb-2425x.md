The Elite Gourmet EHB-2425X demonstrates varied performance. It excels in simpler tasks like making mayonnaise and almond milk, yet it struggles with more demanding ones like blending frozen fruits and whipping egg whites. While its ability to puree soup is above average, the shorter blending wand could pose challenges in deeper pots. This model is perhaps best suited for users with basic, lighter blending needs, rather than those seeking a robust, [all-purpose blender](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/) capable of a wide range of heavy-duty tasks. 

Beyond its operational capabilities, the blender's overall build quality and user experience are points of concern. The construction of the EHB-2425X doesn’t inspire confidence, with a general flimsiness that raises doubts about its long-term durability.  Additionally, the ergonomic aspects of the design are underwhelming. The handling and comfort during use are not up to par with what regular or intensive use would require.

**Things We Like**

*   Budget-friendly price
*   Simple, straightforward design 
*   Emulsifying capability

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Supar build quality 
*   Insufficient motor power 
*   Inadequate splatter control 
*   Limited grip comfort

Sporting a 150-watt motor, the Elite Gourmet EHB-2425X represents a [low-range immersion blender](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/best/immersion-blenders/) in terms of power, but what it may lack in sheer force, it compensates for in its compactness and user-friendly design. The question, however, lingers: does this immersion blender's modest power and simple design fully satisfy the diverse needs of home cooking, or are there hidden limitations to its capabilities? Let’s find out!

The Elite Gourmet EHB-2425X delivered adequate performance in soup preparation, effectively handling cooked ingredients and yielding a smooth result. It also fared reasonably well in making mayonnaise and grinding almonds for a batch of creamy almond milk. However, challenges arose when handling denser mixtures such as frozen fruit smoothies, where there was a noticeable decline in performance. The lack of an extra whisk attachment means our blender also underperformed in tasks that require aeration.

### Hot Soup Purée

Pureeing Time: 30 seconds

Result: Smooth

Suction: Slightly

The Elite Gourmet EHB-2425X is at best a basic pureeing tool. Suitable for home use where ultra-smoothness isn't critical, it might be passable. However, it struggles with achieving the fine, velvety texture required for more gourmet culinary applications. Our testing substantiated this, as even after a standard blending interval, the soup exhibited a coarse and uneven texture. Straining only highlighted this deficiency further, revealing a smattering of unblended particles. You may think a 30-second blending benchmark is quite limited for the blender to show its full capability, but there are other blenders that yield an almost perfect result within that allotted time.

You might assume that the 30-second test period is insufficient, but it is noteworthy that there are blenders that can make a pass with an almost perfect purée. They include the [Vitamix 5-speed](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/vitamix/vitamix-immersion-blender/) and the [Ninja Foodi](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/ninja/ninja-foodi-ci101-power-mixer-system/). And this suggests that the shortcomings of the Elite Gourmet EHB-2425X lie in its capability rather than the testing duration.

### Smoothie

Blending Time: 2 mins 30 secs

Result: Leafy

Suction: Slightly

In our test of the Elite Gourmet EHB-2425X's ability to blend a frozen fruit smoothie containing kale, apples, and mangoes, we found its final texture to be inconsistent. While the fruits were broken down reasonably well, the kale remained coarse. Achieving even this moderate texture required an extended blending time of 2 minutes and 30 seconds, a duration that is well beyond that required by more capable blenders. (For example, the Braun MQ7035X). 

As the blending dragged on, the frozen fruits thawed out, resulting in a smoothie that was too thin instead of thick and creamy. Moreover, the process was quite hands-on; it demanded constant manual manipulation of the blender. To ensure complete blending, we had to actively push the blender into the mixture, frequently agitating it to bring unprocessed kale and fruit pieces into the path of the blade. 

Considering these points, it's clear that the Elite Gourmet EHB-2425X is not the best fit for enthusiasts of frozen drinks and smoothies, particularly those incorporating tough greens like kale.

### Mayonnaise

Emulsifying Time: 1 min 40 secs

Result: Smooth

Suction: Slightly

Out of all the tests we ran, the Elite Gourmet EHB-2425X performed at its best when making mayonnaise, whipping up an ideal emulsion in just 1 minute and 40 seconds. This was the most impressive result from the blender across our series of five tests, with the mayonnaise emerging exceptionally smooth and perfectly emulsified.

You may notice the beaker's tendency to wobble under the action of the blending shaft, but this can be easily remedied by using a heavier, more stable container or by placing the beaker within a shallow bowl on the countertop to curb the movement.

### Almond Milk

Grinding Time: 1 min 20 secs

Result: Fine

Suction: Tightly

Finishing the task in a competitive 1 minute and 20 seconds, the Elite Gourmet EHB-2425X matched the average performance of other blenders in our lineup. Our post-straining revealed that the almonds were ground to a fine consistency. This infused the milk with a rich flavor, creamy texture, and the almonds' inherent nutrients. 

Still, it’s worth noting that during the blending process, pieces of almond skin frequently became lodged in the holes of the blade guard. This led to a partial barrier around the blades, hindering efficient contact between the blade and the remaining almonds. Consequently, we had to periodically pause the blending to clear these trapped skins and redistribute the contents to ensure a more uniform grind.

### Whipped Egg-Whites

Beating Time: Failed

Result: Failed

Suction: Failed

For aeration-heavy tasks like whipping egg whites, the Elite Gourmet EHB-2425X proves unsuitable. Its blending mechanism, unlike a dedicated whisk, fails to adequately introduce air. The consequence was a disappointing separation of the egg whites into a frothy upper layer and a watery lower layer, instead of a uniform, fluffy foam.
