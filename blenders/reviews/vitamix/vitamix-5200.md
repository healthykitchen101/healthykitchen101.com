We put the Vitamix 5200 through its paces by blending a variety of challenging ingredients, including frozen fruits, leafy vegetables, raw nuts, ice cubes and dried foods. We were happy to find that it effortlessly pulverized everything we threw at it, producing smooth and consistent textures every time. The only exception was in the ice-crushing test, where it struggled to match some of the other high-quality blenders.  

Nonetheless, this minor drawback doesn’t hurt its overall rating much. The Vitamix 5200 delivers a level of performance that, as far as we can tell, is completely unmatched by any of its competitors.

### Smoothie

Blending Time: 1 min

Result: Silky Smooth

The Vitamix 5200's ability to liquify leafy greens is truly impressive. We put the blender to the test with a mix of kale, apple, banana, pineapple, and plant milk. The resulting smoothie was the epitome of perfection—even the stubborn kale took on a silky, velvety texture with virtually no bits or chunks left behind.

Initially, we achieved this exceptional quality after blending for a full minute. However, through repeated testing, we found that our Vitamix 5200 could deliver the same results in just 40 seconds. This performance far surpasses competitors like [Cuisinart](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/cuisinart/cuisinart-spb-7ch-smartpower/) and Black+Decker, which took nearly four times longer to blend and still didn’t manage the same smooth consistency.

The extraordinary outcome of the Vitamix 5200 test is a testament to the blender's exceptional design. The uniquely shaped container and high-performance components, such as aircraft-grade stainless steel blades, collaborate to generate an ideal vortex that pulls ingredients downward. Consequently, the blender can break down the cell walls of fruits and vegetables, resulting in faster, smoother blends.

### Frozen Fruit Smoothie

Blending Time: 1 min 10 seconds

Result: Silky Smooth

The Vitamix 5200's performance in this test was truly exceptional. Within the first 45 seconds, all the frozen fruits were completely transformed into a velvety smooth concoction. We can confidently say it’s rare to find a blender that can do the job so quickly. 

However, for some reason, the milk did not fully integrate with the fruit smoothie mixture—a white layer remained on top of the rest of the orange smoothie mixture. Despite continued blending in hopes of improving the texture, it became clear that the blender alone wouldn’t fully incorporate the milk. As a result, we paused the blender at the 60-second mark and manually stirred the mixture before resuming blending. After an additional 10 seconds, we finally achieved a homogeneous mixture.

This test also demonstrated how important a tamper can be in promoting a smooth, quick blend. We found that by continuously pushing ingredients down towards the blade, we could expedite the blending process significantly. Our tamper tests turned out flawless smoothies. Only a few tiny flecks of raspberry skin and seeds remained, but they were negligible and did not did not compromise the overall quality of the drink.

### Protein Shake

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clha92clk0008668859ig6euj.jpg" alt="The Vitamix 5200 motor base stands beside the container.

Blending Time: 1 min

Result: Silky Smooth

This test poses a particularly demanding challenge, combining notoriously tough ingredients such as raw nuts and chewy dried berries. Yet, once again, the Vitamix 5200 rose to the occasion. It set a new benchmark for heavy-duty performance by effortlessly liquifying everything in this protein shake in just one minute, leaving little to critique.

In contrast, other blenders we tested struggled to keep up, with most leaving three times as much unblended debris within that time frame. The [Hamilton Beach](https://healthykitchen101.com/blenders/reviews/hamilton-beach/hamilton-beach-wave-crusher-54221/) blender performed the worst, taking up to 4 minutes and 30 seconds to process the oatmeal, yet producing a vastly inferior result with three times the amount of unblended chunks when compared to the Vitamix 5200.

### Almond Butter

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clha94kkr000a66884kpi0tcj.jpg" alt="The Vitamix 5200 is beside a white plate containing almond butter with a spatula nestled inside, and a smartphone revealing a blending time of 1 minute." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clha95l2g000b6688dapg2wmb.jpg" alt="A sample of almond butter created with a Vitamix 5200 blender, spread on a white paper." width="300px" height="200px">

Blending Time: 1 min

Result: Silky Smooth

Almond butter is possible thanks to the nuts’ natural oils. Properly extracted, the oil creates that signature creamy and velvety texture. However, not every blender is capable of effectively breaking the almonds down into a fine powder while also incorporating the natural oils and creating the proper texture. This means that certain blenders may require added oils or sweeteners to achieve the right consistency. _(For example, the Hamilton Beach and Cuisinart.)_ 

But fear not, because the Vitamix 5200 is the exception to the rule. In just 60 seconds of blending, this machine gave us a scrumptious and silky-smooth almond butter that outshone every other blender we tested. And since it can create almond butter with just the nuts themselves, the end result is a healthier and more natural spread that retains all of the almonds’ nutrients and flavor. For anyone looking to make homemade nut butter with ease and without any artificial ingredients, the Vitamix 5200 is undoubtedly the best option.

### Crushed Ice

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clha979oz000c66882fipa2xu.jpg" alt="The Vitamix 5200 is beside a black tray containing its crushed ice." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clhaaxd87000s6688h7q41ioz.jpg" alt="The scale's screen shows  2.28 oz of unblended ice cubes remaining from the Vitamix 5200. " width="300px" height="200px">

Ice Fineness: Fine

Unblended Ice: 19% of 12 oz

The Vitamix 5200's ice-crushing performance fell short of our expectations. It was able to crush some—but not all—of this test’s 12 oz worth of ice. About 19% (approximately 2.3 oz) remained unblended. The resulting crushed ice was not as snow-like as we had hoped, though it was still good enough for use in drinks that call for crushed ice, like cocktails and slushies.

One possible reason for the incomplete blending is that the ice became trapped under the blades. The tamper may have contributed to this issue; we used it to vigorously push ice downward. In addition, ice has a natural tendency to clump together, and these clumps can cause the blades to lock up and stop spinning. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the Vitamix 5200 simply does not excel at crushing ice. 

Despite imperfect results in this test, the Vitamix 5200 is still among the few blenders that can claim any reasonable ability to crush ice. For best results, we recommend blending only 6-8 oz of ice at a time.

### Dimensions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clha9fajn000f66885oay0tfg.jpg" alt="llustrated dimensions of the Vitamix 5200 Blender showing the height, depth, and width across in inches" width="300px" height="200px">

Height: 19.7" (50.0 cm)

Width: 8.8" (22.4 cm)

Weight: 9.7 lbs (4.4 kg)

Length: 7.8" (19.7 cm)

Measuring 7.8 by 8.8 inches at the base, and standing 19.7 inches tall with the container attached, the Vitamix 5200 blender has a relatively large footprint. Its height, in particular, means it may not fit with the standard 18-inch clearance between kitchen countertops and cabinets. Make sure you have a place to put it before you buy.

### 10 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clha9mnvo000g6688d0mmhgsl.jpg" alt="A close up of the Vitamix 5200 motor base and container" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clha9nd7r000h66884hm66ymt.jpg" alt="A close up of  Vitamix 5200 container’s bottom" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clha9os8a000i6688bczk292x.jpg" alt="Someone is holding the centering pad of the Vitamix 5200’s motor base" width="300px" height="200px">

Our Vitamix appears to be truly exceptional in terms of build quality, with each component crafted to last. We subjected the blender to a series of rigorous tests but found no signs of wear and tear. All the polished surfaces remained as shiny and perfect as when they first came out of the box. 

The motor base of the Vitamix 5200 is made of die-cast aluminum and high-impact plastic. While the aluminum provides strength and durability, the plastic helps to reduce weight and gives the exterior a nice sheen.  

The container is also a true masterpiece of both style and function. It is made of BPA-free Eastman Tritan copolyester that demonstrates remarkable clarity and heat resistance. The shatterproof design of the container is an added bonus, and we can attest to its durability against accidental drops and falls. 

Inside the container, the blade assembly is another prime example of the Vitamix 5200's attention to detail. The four-pronged blade is made of hardened stainless steel, which is corrosion-resistant and should remain sharp for extended periods.

### 10 - Blades

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clha9qesn000j6688hhvthz9z.jpg" alt="A close up of the Vitamix 5200 blades" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clha9r4zn000k66880opjfh31.jpg" alt="A close up of the Vitamix 5200 blades " width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clha9rrm0000l6688dv4ibkk8.jpg" alt="A close up of the Vitamix 5200 blades" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Stainless Steel

Type: Cross

Blade Count: 4 sharp blades

Removable: Yes

Dishwasher Safe: No

According to Vitamix, the blades are crafted using precision machining techniques. They’re stamped from a sheet of stainless steel, then heat-treated and finished by a computer-controlled laser cutting process to create the unique four-pronged design.

During our tests, we noticed that the blades' sharpness and strategic positioning did increase their effective surface area, enabling them to blend more ingredients in a shorter amount of time, compared to other models. Additionally, they are angled in a way that promotes a high-speed circulation of ingredients and creates a powerful vortex, pulling ingredients towards the blades for even distribution and consistent blending results.

### Motor Base

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clha9t392000m66881yaz0bq0.jpg" alt="A close up of the Vitamix 5200 Motor Base" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clha9trz1000n6688gx8g6l7m.jpg" alt="A close up of the centering pad of the Vitamix 5200 motor base" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clha9uj6x000o668822fo525l.jpg" alt="A close up of the concealed power cord underneath the motor base" width="300px" height="200px">

Rated Voltage: 120 Volts

Rated Power: 1500 Wattages

Working Time: ≤ 6 minute

Protection: Yes

Weight: 7.2 pounds

Cord Length: 5.9 ft (1.8 m)

We found that the motor can maintain consistent torque and cool temperatures at high speeds, which gives this blender the stamina to blend continuously for six minutes at a time—long enough for the blades' friction to heat your soups or sauces to serving temperatures even without the stove. 

While we haven’t conducted specific tests on this blender’s ability to make hot soup, we can attest to the real-world results we've observed in other blending tests. For instance, when making almond butter, the resulting blend was relatively warm due to the blades' friction. The same also went for the protein shake test and this further supports the idea that this Vitamix 5200 blender can generate enough heat to warm up liquids.

### Blending Container

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clhaezosj000u6688azjuazt2.jpg" alt="Illustrated dimensions of Vitamix 5200 Blender Blending Container showing the height, depth, and width across in inches" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: BPA-free Eastman Tritan Copolyester

Capacity: 64 ounces

Weight: 2.5 oz (71 g)

Dishwasher Safe: No

Measurement: Yes

Suitable For: Medium to Large batches

The blending container of the Vitamix 5200 is made from BPA-free Eastman Tritan Copolyester—a top-grade and lightweight material that can withstand impacts, scratches, shattering, and chemical degradation. Tritan Copolyester is also odor and flavor resistant so the container won't absorb any residual flavors or aromas from previous batches of food or liquid. This property is especially important when blending pungent or aromatic ingredients.

### Lid

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clha9yrtt000p66883oje51yi.jpg" alt="The Vitamix 5200’s Two-Part Lid stands on a table" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic

Closing Type: Friction

Features: Lid plug

The blender's lid consists of a high-quality plastic main lid and a flexible, durable rubber lid plug. Together, they form a leak-proof, spill-proof seal. The main lid attaches securely to the container through friction, while the lid plug, easily removable, enables adding ingredients mid-blend without messes. It also accommodates a tamper for pushing ingredients towards the blades, ensuring a smooth blend.

### 10 - Control Panel

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clhaa28z6000q66888kn4fj1s.jpg" alt="A close up of the Vitamix 5200 control panel" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clk0xmpo50011eg88d0p0fjv8.jpg" alt="The Vitamix 5200 Blender Min Speed" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clk0xqhcp0013eg88fifu359j.jpg" alt="The Vitamix 5200 Blender Max Speed" width="300px" height="200px">

Activation: Speed dial and Switch

Min Speed: 1,419 RPM

Max Speed: 23,122 RPM

Presets: No

Digital Display: No

Built-in Timer: No

Pulse Mode: No

The Vitamix 5200 offers great flexibility and precision with its three distinct controls. All the settings have clear markings and are self-explanatory.

You can select either high-speed or variable-speed mode. When set to high, the motor runs at its maximum speed of approximately 23,122 RPM, delivering robust blending power that is perfect for tougher blends. 

However, for more delicate ingredients such as herbs or fruits, the variable speed option is the way to go. In this mode, you select the intensity using the center of the control panel. Option number 1 is the gentlest setting at 1,419 RPM, while 10 equates to the full High mode.

### Extra Accessory: Tamper

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clhaa3azr000r66881ohfac0s.jpg" alt="The Vitamix 5200’s tamper is on a table" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic

Dishwasher Safe: No

Removable: Yes

After conducting numerous tests, we’ve come to regard a tamper as not merely an accessory, but an essential component of any blender. That’s particularly true when blending thicker or heavier mixtures that resist the blades' movement.

When a blender's blades are spinning, they generate a suction force that causes the ingredients to move towards the bottom of the container. However, thick ingredients or mixtures may not respond. This is where the tamper comes into play and proves its significance.

Without the tamper, it would be considerably more challenging, if not impossible, for the Vitamix 5200 to produce a perfect frozen fruit smoothie in such a short amount of time.

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **8.7**

*   Ease of Blend (40%) - **9.0**/10
    
*   Noise Level (20%) - **7.0**/10
    
*   Assembly (15%) - **9.0**/10
    
*   Cleanability (25%) - **9.5**/10
    

The blender's control panel is user-friendly and intuitive, promoting easy use without needing to consult the manual. While the tall, narrow cup can be challenging to hand-wash for those with larger hands, it cleans easily by running soapy water in it at high speed. Assembly is simple, but the absence of a locking mechanism can lead to instability with tough ingredients. The lid fits snugly, requiring some force to secure, but is easily removable.

### 9.0 - Ease of Blend

The Vitamix 5200 blended ingredients smoothly with minimal user intervention, unlike other blenders that often required stopping to manually adjust the contents, leading to uneven blends and messes. A concern with the Vitamix 5200 was the container's shaky connection to the motor base, particularly noticeable when crushing ice or blending frozen fruits. This sometimes made it feel like the container might come loose, necessitating a firm grip on the handle for stability.

While we can't confirm if the container would actually detach, for safety and best results, it's recommended to use the blender on a flat surface and hold the container handle firmly. Starting at a lower speed and gradually increasing helps manage any instability during blending.

### 7.0 - Noise Level

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/blenders/clhabwu41000t6688ejru2pwc.jpg" alt="The Vitamix 5200 blender is on a table, accompanied by a sound level meter displaying its noise level nearby. In the background, other blenders that we tested sit on a nearby shelf." width="300px" height="200px">

Max Level: 99.8 dB

The noise level of a blender is mostly dictated by the power of its motor. The Vitamix 5200’s robust motor reaches 99.8 dB in our noise level test using ice cubes and water to simulate the blending of an icy smoothie. This noise level is akin to a motorcycle or a lawn mower. However, since it does its job so quickly, the noise is short-lived. Most users won’t find it particularly problematic.

### 9.0 - Assembly

Assembling the Vitamix 5200 is simple. Start by aligning the container's tabs with the motor base's notches and sliding it into place; there's no locking mechanism, so it won't click into position. Then, insert the lid plug into the main lid, turning it clockwise until it's secure. To attach the lid, align its flaps between the spout and handle and press down firmly – it may require some force, but this ensures it stays put during blending. The lid is tight but easy to remove after use.

### 9.5 - Cleanability

None of the Vitamix blender's parts are dishwasher-safe, but they are all straightforward to clean by hand. The container's smooth interior surface makes it easy to rinse and prevents food residue buildup. Its design ensures most remnants wash off quickly, a feature shared with the two-part lid that has minimal crevices. The motor base, being sleek and user-friendly, typically requires just a simple wipe with a cloth. Spills are rare thanks to the effective lid and spout design. For the blade assembly, removal allows for thorough cleaning, though using a brush is advised for safety and reaching all areas.
