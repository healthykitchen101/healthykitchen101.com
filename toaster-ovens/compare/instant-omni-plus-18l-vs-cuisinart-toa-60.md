With its one swirl nichrome plus four quartz heating elements and a strong convection system, the Instant Omni Plus **consistently performs well**. However, the Cuisinart **edges out** its competitor with its steady and stable temperature from six nichrome heating elements and an all-applicable convection fan.

The Instant shines with an LCD touchscreen fed with smart programs and all the necessary cooking functions. While each oven is user-friendly in its own way, the unique cooking presets of the Instant can be **extra helpful** for beginners.

The Cuisinart’s strength lies in its robust, effective, and lasting construction with a straightforward 100% analog control. In all honesty, the control dials of the Cuisinart make it **more difficult** to pinpoint an exact time and temperature compared to the digital display of the Instant. However, that makes it all the more impressive when it out-performs the Instant.

Although both ovens feature an **interior light** and a **slide-out crumb tray**, the Instant has three tray levels while the Cuisinart has two. Both ovens have an air fryer basket in addition to the standard accessories, but the Instant comes with a rotisserie kit as well.

The Instant suffers from minor drawbacks of its own technology while trying to maximize convenience. The Cuisinart doesn’t offer many features of convenience due to its simplistic approach, which is also not an issue.

Delivering **excellent quality** in every cent, the Instant Omni Plus 18L and the Cuisinart TOA-60 are both **high-performing** medium-sized convection toaster ovens.
