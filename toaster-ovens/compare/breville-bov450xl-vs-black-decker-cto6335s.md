The Breville BOV450XL and the Black+Decker CTO6335 **stand toe to toe** in our performance **tests,** but the latter has a slight edge. While the Breville is **better at** making toast and baking french fries, the Black+Decker scores **more consistently** throughout. It also has the **upper hand** in baking pizzas and roasting a whole chicken.

Although both ovens have four efficient quartz heating elements, the Breville uses **1800 W**, which usually results in better performance compared to the Black+Decker’s **1500 W**. However, this strength is hindered by the absence of a convection system and by the **inconsistent heating** of the elements which is due to the oven’s smart algorithms.

While both have more cooking functions apart from just baking and broiling, the Breville has a slight advantage because of its unique features, including a **temperature conversion** button. In addition, although both ovens have a control panel that’s easy to use, the Breville’s buttons and dial are **more reliable** and **responsive** than the Black+Decker’s.

Both ovens have a slide-out crumb tray and a standard baking rack and pan, but the Black+Decker is equipped with a broiling rack. Though both have a black interior and no internal lighting, the Breville has an edge, thanks to its **non-stick coating**.

Overall, the Breville BOV450XL is a **well-constructed**, **small-sized**, smart countertop toaster oven. On the other hand, the Black+Decker CTO6335 is a good **budget**, **large-sized** countertop convection toaster oven with a sturdy tamper-resistant casing.
