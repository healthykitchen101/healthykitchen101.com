It’s interesting to compare two different large digital convection toaster ovens that both have the word ‘pro’ in their names—the Ninja Foodi XL Pro (DT201) and Breville Smart Oven Pro (BOV845BSS). Let’s see who is the actual pro and who is the amateur.

The two toaster ovens are equal in terms of interior features—both having an interior light, a convection system, and more than 4 quartz heating elements. They also go toe-to-toe in their build quality with their responsive control panel and well-insulated stainless steel casing.

Both machines are easy to use, having well-designed cooking functions and an informative digital display. However, the extra toggle switches of the Breville failed to actually increase ease of use, as opposed to the Ninja.

The Breville’s performance scores aren’t as high as the Ninja’s despite also having a convection system and the same power output. The key differences can be boiled down to the Breville not being able to maintain the temperature as constant and distribute the heat as evenly as the Ninja.
