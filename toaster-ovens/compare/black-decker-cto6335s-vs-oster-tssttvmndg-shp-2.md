The Black+Decker CTO6335S and the Oster TSSTTVMNDG-SHP-2 are **quite evenly matched** as large countertop convection toaster ovens. Thus, we can only pick a winner based on minute details.

Concerning our performance tests, the Black+Decker had a **minor advantage** when making toast while the Oster **won hard** in the pizza-baking test. They then proceeded to go toe to toe roasting a whole chicken and baking french fries with a slight edge going to the Oster on both occasions.

The Black+Decker has **more efficient** heating elements and runs at a **higher power output** than the Oster. However, it’s hard to identify how these aspects affect their respective performance.

Both ovens are simple and robust in design and come with similar accessories. The Black+Decker, however, gained some points with its tamper-resistant casing. Its raised buttons are also **more responsive** than the Oster’s flat buttons. But the Oster makes up some of that lost ground in the usability ranking thanks to its togglable interior light.

Based on the score, the Oster TSSTTVMNDG-SHP-2 earned a **narrow victory** with slightly better performance and ease of use. Nonetheless, the Black+Decker CTO6335S is its worthy adversary at a **cheaper price**.
