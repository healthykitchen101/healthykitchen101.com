If these reasons check out on your list of priorities, then you should consider purchasing a toaster oven.

1\. Rapid Cooking Time
----------------------

Because they are generally smaller than full-sized ovens or wall ovens, most toaster ovens require much less time—**up to half** the amount—to preheat.

An average full-size oven take approximately 15 minutes to reach 350°F, ≅ 20 minutes to 400°F, and ≅ 25 minutes to 450°F. Meanwhile, the average toaster ovens take around 7-8 minutes to reach 350°F, 10-11 minutes to 400°F, and ≅ 15 minutes to 450°F.

2\. Efficient Energy Consumption
--------------------------------

Opting to use a toaster oven over a traditional oven can also have an impact on your energy consumption. Most toaster ovens can produce similar results to a full-size oven using just [**about half the energy**](https://www.energystar.gov/sites/default/files/asset/document/ENERGY_STAR_Scoping_Report_Toaster_Ovens.pdf); a great way to reduce your electricity bill and environmental footprint.

These machine can have a variety of power ratings ranging from 800 W to 2200 W depending on their assembly. On the other hand, full-sized ovens can have their power output ranging from 2000 W to 5000 W.

The power output is equally divided between the working heating elements. For example, in a 1000 W oven with one upper and one lower heating element, each will use 500 W when baking whereas the upper heating element will use 1000 W when broiling.

3\. Various Sizes
-----------------

*   Small toaster ovens (LxWxH): around 14"x11"x8"
*   Medium toaster ovens (LxWxH): around 19"x16"x11"
*   Large toaster ovens (LxWxH): around 20"x16"x12"
*   Extra-large toaster ovens (LxWxH): over 20"x16"x12"

Compared to wall ovens which are usually 24"-27"-30” wide, toaster ovens come in various different sizes. Thus, you should have no trouble finding one that fits your limited counter space, number of servings necessary, and aesthetic preference.

There are small units whose dimensions are around 14"x11"x8" (LxWxH), which can fit four slices of bread or a 9-inch pizza. Medium units can be 19"x16"x11" fitting 4-6 slices or an 11 to 12-inch pizza. Meanwhile, large units can get as big as 20"x16"x12", accommodating 6-8 slices or a 12 to 13-inch pizza.

Finally, we have extra-large units which can be anything over 20"x16"x12". They have a much bigger capacity than large-sized units and often have more than four tray levels.

Note that manufacturers have not yet standardized toaster oven sizes and these measurements are only a basic guideline.
