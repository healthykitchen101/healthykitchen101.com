The stainless steel Cosori CO130-AO Countertop Convection Air Fryer Toaster Oven made its way to the top of our list for the value it provided. If you’re looking for an excellent large [countertop toaster oven](https://healthykitchen101.com/toaster-ovens/reviews/best/), whether you’re a beginner or an experienced cook, look no further.

With 1800 W of power, four nichrome heating elements, and a powerful convection system, the oven performed consistently great in our tests. Its handy accessories like the rotisserie kit and air fryer basket further prepared the machine for anything we could throw at it.

In addition, the cooking process felt worry-free thanks to a well-designed LED display, cooking functions, feature toggles, and an automatic preheat phase.

Of course, the oven wasn’t without some minor flaws. While the cooking chamber was spacious, it didn’t have a non-stick coating to help with the cleaning.

**Things We Like**

*   Great value in terms of functionality and accessories
*   Straightforward controls
*   Useful toggles
*   High-contrast digital display
*   Sturdy construction

The Cosori CO130-AO, on average, performed great throughout all of our tests. It made full use of its high power output of 1800 W and its [powerful convection system](https://healthykitchen101.com/toaster-ovens/reviews/best/convection-toaster-ovens/). To us, these were some of the main grounds for establishing the product’s value for the money. The included rotisserie kit and air fryer basket were also very helpful in our Whole Roasted Chicken and Baked French Fries tests, respectively.

### Toast

Taste: 8

50% \* 8 = 4.0

Even Surface Color: 8

20% \* 8 = 1.6

Consecutive Usability: 6.8

30% \* 6.8 = 2.0

Function: Toast

Number of Slices: 4

Toast Level: 2/7

Cooking Time: 5m 49s

Second Batch: 3m 50s

Convection: No

We started our Toast test with four pieces of white bread. We ran the toast function at level 3. The results were good, but the color was a bit too brown to be ideal. After examining the outcome on level 2, it was clear that was the best option, earning a score of 7.6/10 in total. We also tried toasting at level 1, which resulted in lightly toasted bread, for reference.

At level 2, which automatically set the timer for 5 minutes 49 seconds, the four pieces of toast mostly had a beautiful golden brown color. However, the existence of lighter areas, especially on the bottom side, kept it from being perfect. We considered it worthy of an 8/10 for even surface color.

The taste deserved another 8/10 thanks to the toast’s crispy surface and soft, moist interior. Our head chef, Tuyet Pham, determined the toast would complement pretty much anything, including sandwiches, omelets, eggs benedict, and soup.

After the first batch of toast, we immediately placed the second batch in the oven. The toast level 2 program automatically reduced the time to 3 minutes 50 seconds to account for the last batch’s residual heat.

However, this seemed like too much of a reduction, since the toast came out mostly lacking in color. It wasn’t very crispy either, so we could only give the oven a 6.8/10 for consecutive usability.

### Pizza

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/clahtnla10000ab8897y92v0q.jpg" alt="Cosori Air Fryer Toaster Oven Pizza test" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl9tl2wez002kq588dob59ot6.jpg" alt="Cosori Air Fryer Toaster Oven PizzaA toaster oven baked 9-inch thick-crust meat pizza with cheese, onions, and green bell peppers on top inside a baking pan." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl9tl3apw002lq5883aljf0z3.jpg" alt="Two slices of oven baked 9-inch thick-crust meat pizza with cheese, onions, and green bell peppers on top of one another." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl9tl3j3j002mq588c1bg7bax.jpg" alt="Two hands break apart a slice of pizza with cheese, meat, onions, and green bell peppers on top baked using a toaster oven." width="300px" height="200px">

30% \* 7 = 2.1

Function: Bake

Temperature: 450°F

Cooking Time: 3m 30s

Convection: Yes

The Cosori’s ability to maintain a high temperature really shined in our Pizza test, garnering a score of 7.6/10.

With a high power output and powerful convection system, it only took 3 minutes 30 seconds to bake a 9-inch thick-crust meat pizza placed on tray level 2. This was extremely fast and deserving of a 10/10, the same as the [Cuisinart TOA-60](https://healthykitchen101.com/toaster-ovens/reviews/cuisinart/cuisinart-toa-60/) which has the current highest pizza score.

However, the short cooking time resulted in uneven heating in the pizza crust and toppings.

While the bottom right quarter of the crust was golden brown, the rest didn’t have much color. Only that well-cooked part was crispy while the rest was soft, so we gave the crust a 7/10.

The same happened to the toppings. The bottom right quarter had a lot of caramelization—to the point that the onions even charred—while the rest was only mildly caramelized. In addition, the cheese wasn’t very melty, so we gave the toppings a 7/10 as well.

Taste-wise, our chef said it would be better if it weren’t for the slight bitterness from the charred onions. She gave the pizza another 7/10.

### Whole Roasted Chicken

Function: Rotisserie

Temperature: 350°F

Cooking Time: 40m

Convection: Yes

We’ve conducted our Whole Roasted Chicken test a great many times, and the Cosori wasn’t the only one with a high power output and powerful convection system. What set it apart was its rotisserie kit and function.

In addition, the large cooking chamber had more than enough space for a 3 lb chicken to rotate smoothly with a baking pan below to catch the drippings, unlike the [Instant Omni Plus 18L](https://healthykitchen101.com/toaster-ovens/reviews/instant-pot/instant-omni-plus-18l/). Everything together scored a whopping 8.9/10.

The oven took only 40 minutes to roast the chicken to a beautiful color. That was the fastest time we’ve had so far, earning it a perfect 10/10. The skin was mostly golden with some appetizing golden-brown color at the wings and the tips.

However, it seemed like the skin cooked a bit too quickly and the fat wasn’t fully rendered, so the skin wasn’t very crispy. Nonetheless, the skin still deserved an 8.5/10.

What impressed us most was the near-perfect doneness—9.9/10—in such a short amount of time. The chicken had no pink spots and a consistent internal temperature of 178°F-181°F. It was basically spot-on to the USDA’s 165°F-180°F recommendation.

Unfortunately, for some reason, the meat wasn’t as juicy as we had expected. Combined with the less-than-crispy skin, our chef couldn’t give the chicken a higher score than 8/10 after tasting it.

### Baked French Fries

The Cosori took on our Baked French Fries test with its air fryer basket and scored an 8.1/10.

It took 17 minutes to bake 12 oz of frozen fries on tray level 2—quite fast compared to most. After comparing it with other units from our data, we gave it an 8.4/10 for cooking time.

The fries mostly had a great golden color with some of the thinner pieces looking the most appetizing. However, some thicker pieces weren’t as golden, so we gave the fries an 8/10 for color.

The same can be said about the texture of the fries, which earned another 8/10. Most of the fries were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, but the thinner ones were a bit dry and the thicker ones weren’t crispy enough.

Overall, though imperfect, the fries were delicious enough to get one final 8/10 taste score from our chef.

Design

*   Build Quality (50%) - **9.5**/10
    

The Cosori CO130-AO has a lot of design features, all of which are of high build quality. A few that stood out to us were the clear LED display, powerful convection system, large cooking space, high power output, and handy accessories like the rotisserie kit and air fryer basket. If we were trying to be nitpicky, we’d say the interior can be improved with a non-stick coating like the [Breville BOV845BSS](https://healthykitchen101.com/toaster-ovens/reviews/breville/breville-smart-oven-pro/).

The Cosori toaster oven was packed between two foam pads while all six of its accessories were wrapped in carton sheets and taped to the oven. Everything comes in an aesthetically pleasing box with minimal information on it.

All the documents you’ll need are inside a nice envelope. You get a user manual, a recipe book, and some quick references. You’ll also find a QR code leading you to the manufacturer’s website where you can register your product to extend your warranty by an additional year.

### 9.0 - Exterior

Weight: 15.7 lbs (7.1 kg)

Length: 20.0" (50.7 cm)

Width: 17.3" (44.0 cm)

Height: 12.6" (32.0 cm)

Material: Stainless steel

Color: Silver

Door Handle: Cool-touch

Tray Indicators: No

Crumb Tray: Removable

During our assessment, a prominent aspect of the Cosori toaster oven is the air ventilation holes on all sides of the casing to accommodate its powerful convection system. In addition, the glass door has indicators corresponding to the oven’s three tray levels and twelve cooking functions.

The oven doesn’t have carrying handles but it’s not heavy for its size so it’s not a big problem. Our measurements of 19.96" x 17.32" x 12.6" pretty much aligned with the manufacturer’s 20.1" x 16.5" x 12.5" with marginal differences being less than one inch. The difference in width is probably because we took the door handle into account.

### Control Panel

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/clai1d5860007ab88hiy7gb4t.jpg" alt="Cosori Air Fryer Toaster Oven Control Panel" width="300px" height="200px">

Type: LED display + 2 control knobs + 3 buttons

Timer: 1 minute - 6 hours + 12 hours + 24 hours

Indicator Light: Yes

Status Bar: Yes

Light Toggle: Yes

Convection Toggle: Yes

Rotation Toggle: No

Automatic Preheat: Yes

Audio Cues: No

The Cosori Air Fryer Toaster Oven has **2 control dials**, one for functions and one for both timer and temperature. It also has 3 buttons, one for both the interior light and the temperature conversion, one to deploy the convection system, and one Start/Cancel button which lights up when the oven is running.

The LED screen will display ‘E1’ when there’s an open circuit in the temperature monitor and ‘E2’ for a short circuit.

### Cooking Functions

*   Toast (level 1-7)
*   Bagel (level 1-7)
*   Pizza (150°F - 450°F, 1 minute - 6 hours)
*   Bake (150°F - 450°F, 1 minute - 6 hours)
*   Roast (150°F - 400°F, 1 minute - 6 hours)
*   Air Fry (150°F - 400°F, 1 minute - 6 hours)
*   Broil (150°F - 450°F, 1 minute - 6 hours)
*   Cookies (150°F - 450°F, 1 minute - 6 hours)
*   Rotisserie (150°F - 400°F, 1 minute - 6 hours)
*   Dehydrate (100°F - 180°F, 30 minutes - 24 hours)
*   Ferment (80°F - 110°F, 30 minutes - 12 hours)
*   Warm (140°F - 230°F, 1 minute - 12 hours)

Besides the basic cooking functions, which already have a wide time and temperature range, the Cosori air fryer toaster oven also has various practical additional cooking functions allowing for even wider time and temperature ranges.

The ones that impressed us the most were Warm, Dehydrate, and Ferment which can maintain the oven at as low as 140°F, 100°F, and 80°F respectively. Looking at a number of recipes, these temperatures fit their intended purpose, which means this oven can act as a family-sized dehydrator and dough proofer.

Note that only the bottom heating elements operate during these functions.

### 9.5 - Interior

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl9tncldi0034q588edgq6cwj.jpg" alt="The Cosori CO130-AO’s interior has 4 heating elements, 3 levels, a rotisserie socket and bracket, a light, and a fan cavity." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl9tnctx50035q5883ko71bn0.jpg" alt="The Cosori CO130-AO Oven has 4 heating elements, 3 guide rails, and a rotisserie socket on its left cooking chamber wall." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl9tnd2zu0036q58889o39am8.jpg" alt="The Cosori CO130-AO has 3 guide rails, a light, a rotisserie bracket, and a fan cavity on its right cooking chamber wall." width="300px" height="200px">

Heating Elements: 4 nichrome

Convection Fan: Yes

Lighting: Yes

Tray Levels: 3

Rotisserie: Yes

Safety Hook: No

The interior features include a convection fan, light, a rotisserie socket and bracket, three tray levels, and four nichrome heating elements. To be nitpicky, we think it’s a shame it doesn’t have a non-stick coating, so it may accumulate some stubborn stains.

### Capacity

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/clbm2rf4u001z9t883e5jh4io.jpg" alt="An opened front of the Cosori CO130-AO 30L 12-In-1 Rotisserie Toaster Oven with interior measurements on a white background." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 14.2" (36.0 cm)

Width: 13.8" (35.0 cm)

Height: 9.8" (25.0 cm)

The Cosori has a [spacious cooking chamber](https://healthykitchen101.com/toaster-ovens/reviews/best/large-toaster-ovens/) even compared to other large toaster ovens. It can accommodate 6 slices of toast, a 13-inch pizza, or a 5-pound chicken.

We measured the volume to be around 31.49 liters compared to the manufacturer’s listing of 30 liters. The difference is minor and could just be a difference in measuring standards.

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl9tnfaxp0037q5881h443orh.jpg" alt="A three-pronged plug power cord. In the background is the Cosori CO130-AO 30L Dehydrator Air Fryer Rotisserie Toaster Oven." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 40.9" (104.0 cm)

Type: 3-prong plug

Power: 1800 W

Rated Output: 120 V ~ 60 Hz

The power cord has plenty of length for household use—roughly 40.94 inches. It protrudes from the bottom of the oven, unfortunately, so it may create awkward kinks now and then.

### Accessories: Baking Rack

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl9tngq3a0038q5880u0xa435.jpg" alt="A stainless steel baking rack of the Cosori CO130-AO 30L 12-In-1 Dehydrator Rotisserie Toaster Oven on a white background." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 14.2" (36.0 cm)

Width: 13.4" (34.0 cm)

Height: 0.3" (0.7 cm)

Material: Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

The baking rack fits perfectly onto its guide rails to prevent accidents when placing food in the oven. It’s also shaped to maximize the space inside the cooking chamber.

### Accessories: Baking Pan

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl9tnitl70039q5881c9w07iu.jpg" alt="A grooved grey baking pan of the Cosori CO130-AO 30L 12-In-1 Dehydrator Rotisserie Toaster Oven on a white background." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 14.2" (36.0 cm)

Width: 11.8" (30.0 cm)

Height: 1.2" (3.0 cm)

Material: Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

The baking pan also fits the guide rails to fully utilize the cooking space. It has ridges and grooves which can give your food attractive roasting marks and allow drippings some space to flow away. Its coating isn’t completely non-stick, so it may gather some stubborn stains, though.

### Accessories: Removable Crumb Tray

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl9tnkovs003aq588b23ialqa.jpg" alt="A silver removable crumb tray of the Cosori CO130-AO 30L 12-In-1 Dehydrator Rotisserie Toaster Oven on a white background." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 14.0" (35.6 cm)

Width: 12.0" (30.5 cm)

Height: 0.8" (2.0 cm)

Material: Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Not advisable

The crumb tray is a helpful accessory to clean up the pesky falling crumbs and bits. However, some may still fall to the oven’s floor as the tray is removed.

### Accessories: Rotisserie Kit and Lifter

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl9tnmcnu003bq588c396053j.jpg" alt="A stainless steel rotisserie kit and lifter of the Cosori CO130-AO 30L 12-In-1 Air Fryer Toaster Oven on a white background." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 13.8" (35.0 cm)

Width: 13.2" (33.5 cm)

Height: 1.3" (3.3 cm)

Material: Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

With angle-adjustable 2-pronged forks, the rotisserie kit does a fantastic job of securing the chicken. The forks are made from thick steel so they won’t bend. They don’t have a coating, though, so they may be subject to permanent stains. The rod and the lifter, however, have a coating so you won’t need to worry about rust.

### Accessories: Air Fryer Basket

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl9tno7nb003cq588dnre08kf.jpg" alt="A stainless steel air fryer basket of the Cosori CO130-AO 30L 12-In-1 Dehydrator Toaster Oven on a white background." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 14.2" (36.0 cm)

Width: 11.7" (29.8 cm)

Height: 1.2" (3.0 cm)

Material: Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Similar to the baking pan and the oven rack, the air fryer basket fits the guide rails. In this case, however, it’s intended to provide space and allow for heat circulation around the bottom of the food.

The Cosori is made from high-quality and durable 304 stainless steel. The thick casing provides good insulation in addition to a well-thought-out convection system. Thus, the oven only gets hot to the touch after a long cooking time at a high temperature (>400°F).

As for the control panel, the LED display is very easy to see, the control dials turn smoothly, and the buttons are responsive. The accessories are designed to make the most out of the cooking chamber’s interior space.

A well-designed automatic preheat phase, simple toggle options, and practical cooking functions gave the Cosori CO130-AO a good score. The cooking chamber as well as accessories could have better coatings to make them easier to clean, though. As an additional minor inconvenience, the oven doesn’t have a pause-resume mechanism upon opening and closing the oven door.

### 9.5 - User Control

The convection feature can toggle between normal and high, and neither setting makes much noise. The fan can run on all functions except Toast and Bagel.

Since time and temperature are controlled by a single dial, you must toggle between functions. Press the dial’s face to switch between them. Temperature can be adjusted in increments of 5°F or 2°C-3°C.

The timer, however, has different steps depending on the cooking function. For Pizza, Bake, Roast, [Air Fry](https://healthykitchen101.com/toaster-ovens/reviews/best/air-fryer-toaster-ovens/), Broil, Cookies, Rotisserie, and Warm functions, the timer can be adjusted in increments of 1 minute until it reaches 60 minutes, then in increments of 5 minutes from 1-2 hours, in increments of 10 minutes from 2-3 hours, and in increments of 15 minutes from 2-3 hours. For Dehydrate and Ferment functions, the timer only adjusts in increments of 30 minutes.

On top of the many practical cooking functions, the ease with which you can adjust time and temperature makes this oven, overall, simpler to use than many other digital ones. In addition, you can press and hold the time and temperature dial to turn off the display to save energy while you’re not cooking.

### 8.0 - Ease of Use

The Cosori has an automatic preheat phase which engages for the Pizza, Bake, Roast, Broil, Cookies, and Air Fryer functions. If the oven’s already hot, the function will recognize that fact and reduce its preheating time. You can also skip this phase entirely by pressing start a second time.

This toaster oven is one of the rare units that actually preheat to the input temperature. Most others simply heat to a hardwired preheat temperature that cannot be adjusted. 

According to our observation, the Cosori takes around 2-4 minutes to reach 300°F, 3-5 minutes for 325°F, 4-6 minutes for 350°F, and 6-8 minutes for 400°F. When preheating is finished, the oven will beep several times and the display will flash once every minute. You’ll need to press start to initiate cooking or the cooking function will be canceled after 10 minutes.

Thanks to the light toggle button, you have full control over when to turn the light on and off. The door can rest open at a 70° angle to allow food to cool inside the oven. Opening the door doesn’t stop the heating elements or the interior light.

The oven turns off automatically after 30 minutes of no interaction. Nonetheless, we still suggest unplugging it after use for safety reasons.

The Cosori’s EvenRapid Tech™ is advertised to reduce cooking time by 30% thanks to increased heat circulation. Suffice to say, it met our expectations with fast cooking times and even surface caramelization (except on our Pizza test).

### 7.5 - Cleanability

The Cosori’s exterior and interior are made of stainless steel, so they’re usually easy to clean. However, the interior doesn’t have a non-stick coating, so the grease from our whole roasted chicken test led to some extremely stubborn stains on the cooking chamber’s ceiling. We couldn’t completely remove them even after brushing them with a paste of baking soda and water.

The rotisserie forks and rod as well as the rotisserie bracket and the baking pan developed equally stubborn stains. On the bright side, it wasn’t difficult to clean caramelized bits of food from the air fryer basket despite the fishnet design.

The grease on the other walls and around the fan cavity was easy to clean. We were worried that grease might splash into the fan cavity, though.

We were able to easily remove fallen food scraps thanks to the removable crumb tray. However, we still had to tilt the oven to get them all out.
