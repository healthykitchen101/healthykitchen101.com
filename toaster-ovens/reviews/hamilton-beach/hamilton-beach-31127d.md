The brushed stainless steel Hamilton Beach 31127D Countertop Toaster Oven is suitable for anyone looking for a sturdy, inexpensive, medium-sized unit made of durable material. The oven has a simple control panel and no convection system.

The design is simple and robust so it doesn’t have many features of convenience. We did think the roll-top door was a nice touch, though.

Throughout our tests, the oven didn’t perform very well on dishes that require long cooking times and/or high temperatures. This was probably because the power rating is a bit low for its capacity, a problem that our [best products](https://healthykitchen101.com/toaster-ovens/reviews/best/) don’t have.

**Things We Like**

*   Easy-to-clean stainless steel exterior
*   Roll-top door
*   Cool-touch door handle
*   Simple control knobs
*   Stay-on feature
*   Spacious interior

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   No convection fan
*   No internal lighting
*   No safety mechanism for the door

The brushed stainless steel Hamilton Beach 31127D Countertop Toaster Oven is an inexpensive, medium-sized unit. It’s sturdy and made of durable material. Among its stand-out features are a neat roll-top door and a stay-on function. For only $75.99 (at the time of writing), you’ll also get the necessary accessories and cooking functions.

The Hamilton Beach 31127D did a good job at making toast but struggled with french fries. We suspect its 1400 W power draw isn’t sufficient for its capacity, so it couldn’t quite maintain high temperatures. Of course, the lack of a convection system didn’t help either. A more preferable but still affordable choice could be the [Toshiba AC25CEW-BS](https://healthykitchen101.com/toaster-ovens/reviews/toshiba/toshiba-ac25cew/).

### Toast

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl8lhshnt0015dn886un14vxs.jpg" alt="From left to right, 24 pieces of toast for the top and bottom of three toast levels including lighter, medium, and darker." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl8lht4g30016dn88gmcb6gi5.jpg" alt="The top and bottom of the best four pieces of toast from the Hamilton Beach 31127D 6-Slice Easy Reach Roll Top Toaster Oven." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl8lhtqt20017dn886szmajus.jpg" alt="On the left are the top and bottom of four pieces of toast from the first batch, and on the right are from the second batch." width="300px" height="200px">

Toast Level: 3/4 to Medium

Cooking Time: 3m 30s

Second Batch: 3m 30s

Convection: No

We initially set the toast knob to Medium—right at the Toast icon—for our Toast test. The bread came away very dark on the bottom but barely toasted on top. Then, the halfway point to Medium gave the toast no color.

Eventually, we settled on a point 3/4 the way to Medium—around 3 minutes 30 seconds on the timer—as the best option, and awarded it a score of 7.3/10.

At our optimal toasting setting, the Hamilton Beach produced 4 pieces with a great, slightly golden-brown color. Though the oven doesn’t have a convection fan, the color distribution was about 80% even so we gave the toast an 8/10.

The first batch of toast was crispy on the outside while still soft and moist on the inside, so we gave it an 8/10 for taste. Our head chef, Tuyet Pham, said it would go very well with everything including sandwiches, soup, omelets, and eggs benedict.

The second batch represented a significant decrease in performance, scoring only 5.5/10 for consecutive usability. The toast had an uneven, dark brown color plus a burnt flavor. If you want the second batch to be the same as the first, remember to only turn the knob halfway to Medium—around 1 minute 55 seconds on the timer.

### Pizza

Cooking Time: 9m 10s

Convection: No

This oven left a bit to be desired when we tried baking a 9-inch thick-crust meat pizza. We gave it a score of 6.6/10.

It took 9 minutes and 10 seconds to bake a pizza which was slightly faster than the recommended 10 minutes on the label. It only garnered a score of 5.8/10 after being compared to other toaster ovens in our Pizza test, though.

The crust had a good golden brown color but was soft, so we could only give it a 7/10. The toppings were caramelized unevenly and some areas of cheese got darkened. On the bright side, the toppings weren’t dry, so they got a 7/10. After tasting, our chef gave it a 6.5/10.

### Whole Roasted Chicken

Even though the Hamilton Beach could comfortably fit a 3 lb chicken for our Whole Roasted Chicken test, its performance was far from perfect, scoring only 6.3/10.

The oven took 1 hour—our standard for this test—to cook the chicken to a desirable color, so we gave it an 8/10.

After roasting, the skin took on an even golden color on top but only a very light caramelization on the bottom — although that was also even. Unfortunately, the skin was very soft, so we could only give it a 5.5/10.

The chicken reached an internal temperature of 165-176°F which was very close to the USDA recommendation. However, there were pink spots near the bone so we could only give it a 6/10.

The meat was acceptable in terms of texture and juiciness, but didn’t stand out as remarkable. Our chef gave the chicken a 6/10 for taste.

### Baked French Fries

Cooking Time: 27m 15s

Convection: No

Baking 12 oz of french fries clearly wasn’t the Hamilton Beach oven’s forte, and it came away with a score of 5.1/10.

This oven took 27 minutes and 15 seconds to put some color into the french fries. That exceeded our time limit of 25 minutes, though, so it failed the cooking time criterion of our Baked French Fries test.

Even though the fries had some golden ends, most of them basically had no color. We gave them a 6.5/10.

Despite being spread out on the baking pan, the fries didn’t crisp up, so they got a 6/10. Our chef gave the fries a 6.5/10 for taste.

Design: No Lighting or Convection

*   Build Quality (50%) - **7.0**/undefined
    

The design of the Hamilton Beach 31127D is basic with a simple stainless steel exterior. The oven has a similar capacity as other medium-sized toaster ovens, with greater length and width but less height. Its roll-top door is a unique feature that we found useful.

### In the Box

Weight: 9.3 lbs (4.2 kg)

Length: 18.5" (47.0 cm)

Width: 14.6" (37.0 cm)

Height: 9.4" (24.0 cm)

Material: Stainless steel

Color: Silver

Door Handle: cool-touch

Tray Indicators: No

Crumb Tray: Removable

The Hamilton Beach has a stainless steel exterior. Our measurements of the oven’s footprint were 18.5" x 15.56" x 9.41"—marginally different from the manufacturer’s provided 18.74" x 15.24" x 9.41".

What stands out most is the roll-top door with a cool-touch handle. It moves up and out of the way, giving you safe and easy access to your food before, during, and after cooking.

The oven has a back buffer to prevent it from being pushed too close to the wall. Unlike many other toaster ovens, though, you can’t wrap the power cord around the buffer.

### Control Panel

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl60bz9b1001fyq883e0o7kvn.jpg" alt="The control panel of the Hamilton Beach 31127D 6-Slice Toaster Oven has 3 control knobs for temperature, function, and timer." width="300px" height="200px">

Type: 3 control knobs

Temperature: 100°F - 450°F

Timer: 1 minute - 30 minutes + stay-on

Indicator Light: Yes

Status Bar: No

Light Toggle: No

Convection Toggle: No

Rotation Toggle: No

Automatic Preheat: No

Audio Cues: No

The Hamilton beach has three contoured control knobs labeled Temperature, Function, and Timer which are durable and easy to grip. While the timer only runs from 1 minute to 30 minutes, the knob has a stay-on position as well.

### Cooking Functions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl6hghbh3001hek888xff095p.jpg" alt="The function knob of the Hamilton Beach 31127D 6-Slice Toaster Oven has 3 cooking functions including Bake, Broil, and Toast." width="300px" height="200px">

*   Toast
*   Bake
*   Broil

The bake and broil functions will be all you need if you know your way around the kitchen. The temperature knob also includes a Min setting which, at 100°F, can act as a ‘keep warm’ option.

### 1.0 - Interior

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl60c0r5c001gyq8858pq0pz5.jpg" alt="The Hamilton Beach 31127D 6-Slice Roll Top Toaster Oven’s cooking chamber has 4 nichrome heating elements and 2 guide rails." width="300px" height="200px">

Heating Elements: 4 nichrome

Convection Fan: No

Lighting: No

Tray Levels: 2

Rotisserie: No

Safety Hook: No

Unfortunately, the 31127D doesn’t have any interior features worth mentioning, not even internal lighting or a convection system like the [Cuisinart TOA-60](https://healthykitchen101.com/toaster-ovens/reviews/cuisinart/cuisinart-toa-60/). The only thing it has is four nichrome heating elements.

### Capacity

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/clbm2ios2001w9t88h3sg6e3y.jpg" alt="An opened front of the Hamilton Beach 31127D 6-Slice Roll Top Toaster Oven with interior measurements on a white background." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 13.0" (33.0 cm)

Width: 12.2" (31.0 cm)

Height: 7.7" (19.5 cm)

The Hamilton Beach has enough capacity for 6 slices of toast, a 3 lb chicken, or a 12-inch pizza.

We measured the cooking chamber’s volume to be around 19.92 liters which was vastly different from the manufacturer’s stated capacity of 10 liters. However, this could be because we measured from the cooking chamber’s walls to walls whereas the manufacturer stopped before reaching the heating elements.

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl60c2bm8001hyq88ckz6hz8v.jpg" alt="A two-pronged plug power cord. In the background is the Hamilton Beach 31127D 6-Slice Easy Reach Roll Top Door Toaster Oven." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 35.0" (88.9 cm)

Type: 2-prong plug

Power: 1400 W

Rated Output: 120 V ~ 60 Hz

The power cord protrudes from the bottom of the oven which can create some inconvenient bends. Nonetheless, roughly 35" is plenty of cord length for household use. However, the oven doesn’t have a storage place for the cord.

### Accessories: Baking Rack

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl60c4429001iyq8815gp9y5h.jpg" alt="A stainless steel baking rack of the Hamilton Beach 31127D 6-Slice Easy Reach Roll Top Toaster Oven on a grey background." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 13.0" (33.0 cm)

Width: 11.9" (30.2 cm)

Height: 1.0" (2.5 cm)

Material: Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

The rack fits perfectly into the guide rails, reducing the chance of an accident when placing your food in the oven.

### Accessories: Baking Pan

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl60c5tid001jyq8874pqaqe8.jpg" alt="A silver baking pan of the stainless steel Hamilton Beach 31127D 6-Slice Easy Reach Toaster Oven on a grey background." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 11.3" (28.8 cm)

Width: 9.4" (23.8 cm)

Height: 0.7" (1.8 cm)

Material: Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

The baking pan is correctly sized to keep messy food from dripping directly onto the heating elements. It slides into the brackets on the baking rack’s underside, so it’s a perfect fit. Unfortunately, though it has a coating, it isn’t completely non-stick so it can accumulate some stains after a tough roasting mission.

### Accessories: Removable Crumb Tray

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl60c7f98001kyq880ojx6fc8.jpg" alt="A silver removable crumb tray of the stainless steel Hamilton Beach 31127D Easy Reach Toaster Oven on a grey background." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 12.9" (32.8 cm)

Width: 10.0" (25.4 cm)

Height: 0.7" (1.8 cm)

Material: Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Not advisable

The removable crumb tray makes it easier to remove crumbs and other debris from the oven’s floor. However, some may still fall to the bottom of the oven as you take out the tray.

### 7.0 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl6eoo420000jek887air05t6.jpg" alt="The front of an opened Hamilton Beach 31127D 6-Slice Toaster Oven with a removable crumb tray, baking pan, and oven rack." width="300px" height="200px">

The Hamilton Beach is well-constructed out of durable stainless steel. Its contoured knobs turn smoothly and are a nice simple touch.

Although the Hamilton Beach 31127D doesn’t invest much in convenience, it also doesn't pose any problems. You may not be able to select an exact time and temperature with the analog control knobs, but realistically, you don’t lose much precision.

### 6.0 - User Control

The Hamilton Beach only has three simple control knobs but there are a few things to pay attention to. If you wish to set the timer knob for less than 10 minutes, you must first turn it beyond the 10-minute mark (to start the heating) and then roll it back to the setting you want.

Precisely adjusting time and temperature can be a bit difficult but it’s not a major problem. If you’re concerned, use an external timer and an oven thermometer for more accurate measurements.

### 6.0 - Ease of Use

The simple analog control panel makes it very easy to adjust settings on the fly. Once the timer counts down to the Off position, you’ll hear a chime and the oven will shut itself off. Since there’s no digital display, the oven won’t draw any more power even if you leave it plugged in.

The oven’s exterior only gets hot to the touch after a long cooking time at a high temperature. The door can be kept partially open at many degrees but keep in mind that it doesn’t switch the oven off.

### 8.0 - Cleanability

We cleaned the Hamilton Beach in accordance with our toaster oven cleaning guide. The oven was easy to clean thanks to its surface coatings and the fact that it has no tricky nooks and crannies.

The removable crumb tray made it easy to clean up the crumbs, though we still had to tilt the oven to get the last of them. Unfortunately, after our Whole Roasted Chicken test, the baking pan accumulated some discoloration that we weren’t able to remove even with a paste of baking soda and water.

Hamilton Beach 31127D FAQs
--------------------------

**Does this oven have internal lighting? Does this oven have a stay-on function?**

No, the Hamilton Beach doesn’t have internal lighting. Yes, it has a stay-on function.
