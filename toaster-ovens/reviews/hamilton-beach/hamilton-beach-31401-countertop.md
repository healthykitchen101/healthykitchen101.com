The stainless steel Hamilton Beach 31401 Countertop Toaster Oven & Pizza Maker has a basic, lightweight, and small-sized structure. It saves energy with a low power output and quartz heating elements.

However, this aspect partially led to inadequate results in our test dishes that require a long cooking time and/or a high temperature. The oven’s weaknesses become more apparent when compared to the [top toaster oven](https://healthykitchen101.com/toaster-ovens/reviews/best/) we tested.

While a simple design means no additional convenience, the control panel and the cleaning are straightforward.

**Things We Like**

*   Lightweight and small size
*   Easy-to-clean stainless steel exterior
*   Cool-touch door handle

*   Stay-on feature
*   Quartz heating elements have safeguards
*   Energy-saving

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   No convection fan
*   No internal lighting
*   No safety mechanism for the door

The stainless steel Hamilton Beach 31401 Countertop Toaster Oven & Pizza Maker is a lightweight and small-sized unit. For $62.99 (at the time of writing), you’ve got quartz heating elements that save energy on top of a basic design. The user control is simple and it has a stay-on feature.

Our test results showed that the Hamilton Beach 31401 did a good job of making toast. However, it didn’t perform well in dishes that require a long cooking time and/or a high temperature, including pizza, whole roasted chicken, and baked french fries.

Our resulting test dishes were also mostly lacking in color, except for the toast. This was possibly due to the oven’s low power output in addition to having only two heating elements, unlike the [Breville BOV450XL](https://healthykitchen101.com/toaster-ovens/reviews/breville/breville-bov450xl/). One solution could be to decrease the amount of food compared to our test amount.

### Toast

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl9dt0773000qhq882e212cv4.jpg" alt="From left to right, 24 pieces of toast for the top and bottom of three toast levels including lighter, medium, and darker." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl8lght0g0012dn88ctdef7id.jpg" alt="The top and bottom of the best four pieces of toast from the Hamilton Beach 31401 4-Slice Capacity Countertop Toaster Oven." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl8lgi3kr0013dn88bj60958s.jpg" alt="On the left are the top and bottom of four pieces of toast from the first batch, and on the right are from the second batch." width="300px" height="200px">

Taste: 8

50% \* 8 = 4.0

Even Surface Color: 7.5

20% \* 7.5 = 1.5

Consecutive Usability: 7.3

30% \* 7.3 = 2.2

Function: Toast

Number of Slices: 4

Toast Level: Medium

Cooking Time: 4m 15s

Second Batch: 4m 15s

Convection: No

With our Toast test, we determined the best option was right at the position of the Toast icon—around 4 minutes 15 seconds on the timer, scoring a 7.7/10. Turning the knob halfway down would result in no color and turning it halfway up nearly burnt the toast.

With 4m 15s, the Hamilton Beach produced 4 pieces with a light golden brown color on the top and golden on the bottom. Although that was great, the top and the bottom were quite different and they were both only about 80% even throughout. Thus, we gave it a 7.5/10.

The first batch of toast had a nice balance of crispiness on the outside and softness on the inside, deserving an 8/10 for taste. Our head chef Tuyet Pham determined it would go well with pretty much everything including eggs benedict, omelet, and especially sandwiches. It wasn’t as suitable for soup but the second batch was.

The second batch got crispier and more even in color. However, it also became browner so we gave it a 7.3/10 for consecutive usability. If you want the second batch to be the same as the first, remember to only turn the knob to ¾ to Medium—around 3 minutes 40 seconds.

### Pizza

30% \* 7 = 2.1

Function: Bake

Temperature:  450°F

Cooking Time: 10m 30s

Convection:  No

The Hamilton didn’t perform well in baking a 9-inch thick-crust meat pizza scoring a 5.6/10.

Compared to the recommended 10 minutes on the label, the oven took only a tad bit longer at 10m 30s. However, this meant that it failed the cooking time criterion with 10 minutes being the time limit for our Pizza test.

For the most part, the crust didn’t have a good toasted coloring and was soft so it got a 6/10. The toppings had pretty good caramelization but some darkened areas of the cheese lowered the score to 7.5/10. After tasting the pizza, our chef gave it a 7/10.

### Whole Roasted Chicken

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl8witvhp0027tp88d9idgond.jpg" alt="A whole roasted chicken using the Hamilton Beach 31401 Toaster Oven on a baking rack and baking pan on a white background." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl8wiu47u0028tp8896j506bk.jpg" alt="A tray of whole toaster oven roasted chicken.

Function: Rotisserie

Temperature: 350°F

Cooking Time: 1h 30m

Convection: No

This was one of the rare occasions where an oven failed the entirety of our Whole Roasted Chicken test. Our speculations concerned the instability of the heating elements and the fact that the chicken grazed the upper safeguard during cooking.

After 1h 30m—our time limit, the oven wasn’t able to roast the chicken to a desirable outcome and failed the first criterion. After roasting, the skin had no noticeable caramelization and barely enough for a 5/10.

The chicken reached an internal temperature of 176°F which was quite good. However, the meat itself was undercooked and still pink in a lot of areas. Thus, it was another failure. Due to the meat being undercooked, our chef couldn’t taste it to give a score.

### Baked French Fries

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl8wix11g002btp88e1px7nwp.jpg" alt="Pieces of baked french fries using the Hamilton Beach 31401 Toaster Oven on a silver baking pan on a white background." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl8wix94v002ctp88esl7eecg.jpg" alt="A close-up of pieces of baked french fries using the Hamilton Beach 31401 Oven on a silver baking pan on a white background." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl8wixhb8002dtp8890nv5klb.jpg" alt="Six pieces of broken-up baked french fries are stacked on top of pieces of whole fries on a silver baking pan." width="300px" height="200px">

The Hamilton Beach wasn’t suitable for baking 12 oz of french fries scoring only a 4/10.

There were no noticeable changes to the fries after 30 minutes of baking in this oven. Due to our time limit of 25 minutes, this constituted a failure in the cooking time section of our Baked French Fries test.

There was no change in the fries’ color so they received a 5/10. The oven basically thawed and heated the fries so they were very soggy scoring another 5/10. Our chef could only give the fries a minimal score of 5/10 for taste.

Heating Elements: 2 quartz

Convection Fan: No

Lighting: No

Tray Levels: 2

Rotisserie: No

Safety Hook: No

The 31401 has 2 quartz heating elements that cook food using infrared light. To avoid direct contact with baking pans and trays, each one has its own safety guard.

Compared to the more common nichrome heating elements, they produce more heat and cool down faster. In addition, they’re easier to clean and more energy-efficient but not as durable. However, if grease splashes onto the heating elements while cooking, it’ll leave permanent stains.

Nonetheless, the oven suffers from a lack of internal lighting and a convection system, similar to most small units like the [Mueller MT-175](https://healthykitchen101.com/toaster-ovens/reviews/mueller/mueller-4-slice/). Moreover, having only two heating elements may not distribute heat evenly as having four.

### Capacity

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/clofh6fk8001viy88ckph18cw.jpg" alt="An opened front of the Hamilton Beach 31401 4-Slice Countertop Toaster Oven with interior measurements on a white background." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 10.9" (27.8 cm)

Width: 9.4" (24.0 cm)

Height: 7.1" (18.0 cm)

The Hamilton Beach, with only two tray levels, can accommodate 4 slices of toast, a 9-inch pizza, or barely a 3 lb chicken. We measured the cooking chamber’s volume to be roughly 12 liters which coincided with the manufacturer’s stated capacity.

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl605g5sv0002yq8885jlhr19.jpg" alt="A two-pronged plug power cord. In the background is the Hamilton Beach 31401 4-Slice Capacity Countertop Toaster Oven." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 29.9" (76.0 cm)

Type: 2-prong plug

Power: 1200 W

Rated Output: 120 V ~ 60 Hz

The power cord is long enough for household use.

### Accessories: Baking Rack

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl605gwsx0003yq8811017ip1.jpg" alt="A stainless steel baking rack of the Hamilton Beach 31401 4-Slice Capacity Countertop Toaster Oven on a grey background." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl605h6nr0004yq88c4auevk7.jpg" alt="Some burnt bits on the stainless steel baking rack of the Hamilton Beach 31401 4-Slice Toaster Oven on a grey background." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 10.9" (27.8 cm)

Width: 8.8" (22.3 cm)

Height: 0.9" (2.3 cm)

Material: Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

The rack fits perfectly with the guide, which helps prevent accidents when placing your food in the oven. Unfortunately, by burning a batch of toast, we left some extremely stubborn burnt bits on some rods.

### Accessories: Baking Pan

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl605i0360005yq883a4gh1qc.jpg" alt="A silver baking pan of the stainless steel Hamilton Beach 31401 4-Slice Countertop Toaster Oven on a grey background." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl605i8th0006yq887u4vgkd3.jpg" alt="Permanent stains on the silver baking pan of the Hamilton Beach 31401 4-Slice Countertop Toaster Oven on a grey background.Permanent stains on the silver baking pan of the Hamilton Beach 31401 4-Slice Countertop Toaster Oven on a grey background." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 9.3" (23.5 cm)

Width: 8.1" (20.5 cm)

Height: 0.7" (1.8 cm)

Material: Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

The baking pan rests on the supports of the baking rack to catch any drippings and meat juice, preventing any mess and the risk of fire from dirty heating elements. However, it doesn’t have a good coating and sustained permanent stains after our Baked French Fries and Whole Roasted Chicken test.

### Accessories: Removable Crumb Tray

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl605k9y50007yq888jxp6k9e.jpg" alt="A removable crumb tray of the stainless steel Hamilton Beach 31401 4-Slice Countertop Toaster Oven on a grey background." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 10.9" (27.8 cm)

Width: 8.1" (20.5 cm)

Height: 0.8" (2.0 cm)

Material: Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Not advisable

Without a tray, falling crumbs are quite a hassle to clean up. However, some can still fall to the bottom of the oven as you remove the tray.

### 5.0 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl6ektriw000hek8843jg57o0.jpg" alt="The front of an opened Hamilton Beach 31401 4-Slice Toaster Oven with a silver baking pan and a stainless steel oven rack." width="300px" height="200px">

The Hamilton uses durable material but its construction isn’t very sturdy. Even though the control knobs turned smoothly, they felt a bit loose.

Usability: Not Much Offered
---------------------------

usability Scores: **NaN**

*   User Control (30%) - **7.0**/undefined
    
*   Ease of Use (50%) - **3.0**/undefined
    
*   Cleanability (20%) - **5.0**/undefined
    

While the Hamilton Beach 31401 doesn’t offer much in terms of usability, it also doesn’t cause any inconvenience. Although the analog control knobs can make it difficult to pinpoint an exact time and temperature, it wasn’t a big problem.

### 7.0 - User Control

Even though the Hamilton Beach only has three simple control knobs, there are a few things to keep in mind. For the timer knob, when setting it to less than 10 minutes, always rotate past 10 minutes and then rotate back to the desired time.

It’s also tricky to precisely adjust time and temperature but we didn’t find this to be an issue. You can use an oven thermometer and an external timer to get familiar before eye-balling it.

### 3.0 - Ease of Use

With three control knobs, it’s very simple to readjust cooking settings. The cooking cycle finishes when the timer reaches Off. When this happens, the oven will ding once and shut off. As it has no digital display, you can freely leave this oven plugged in without worrying about power consumption.

It’s easy to keep the door partially open to let food cool down but be careful as the oven’s exterior gets hot to the touch quite quickly. However, opening the door doesn’t stop the oven, unlike [some others](https://healthykitchen101.com/toaster-ovens/reviews/best/small-toaster-ovens/).

### 5.0 - Cleanability

The Hamilton Beach oven’s exterior and interior were easy to clean following the steps of our toaster oven cleaning guide. Due to the chicken touching the upper safeguard during cooking, there were some caramelized bits stuck to it. Nonetheless, they were easy to remove with just dish soap and a sponge.

We accidentally burnt a batch of toast during our test and it caught fire which led to some discoloration on the oven’s exterior. Luckily, we were able to remove most of it with an all-purpose cleaner.

What surprised us the most, however, were the permanent stains left on the baking pan. Even after we applied a paste of baking soda and water and then scrubbed it with diluted vinegar, the stains didn’t budge at all.
