The Oster TSSTTVFDDG Digital French Door Convection Toaster Oven is one of the [largest capacity ovens we’ve tested](https://healthykitchen101.com/toaster-ovens/reviews/best/large-toaster-ovens/). Even so, its sleek, elongated design fits spaces well, and the polished stainless steel casing is aesthetically pleasing in any kitchen.

It’s worth noting that the oven’s maximum power draw of 1500 W was enough to roast a whole chicken to great results. However, the oven showed limitations in heating speed and maintaining temperatures greater than 400°F for toast, pizza, and especially frozen french fries. This means that this oven is mostly good for slow-roasting and baking sweets, not sizzling hot dishes.

Furthermore, good ventilation, cool-touch door handles, and a removable crumb tray weren’t enough to justify the price. Essentially, it lacks premium design and usability features often seen in competitively-priced toaster ovens.

**Things We Like**

*   Large capacity
*   Interior lighting available
*   Easy-to-clean stainless steel exterior
*   Sturdy build
*   Air-ventilation holes on all sides
*   Cool-touch door handles
*   Convenient slide-out crumb tray

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   No convection toggle
*   Buttons not reliably responsive
*   Not very budget-friendly

The polished stainless steel Oster TSSTTVFDDG Digital French Door Convection Toaster Oven has a sleek aesthetic design and an extra large capacity. It also has a full range of accessories and its cooking functions include convection bake. However, despite these features, it’s not the most budget-friendly oven.

For roasting (which doesn’t require high heat) the Oster TSSTTVFDDG did well. However, it took time to reach higher temperatures. Additionally, it didn’t perform well with toast, pizza, and especially french fries that require higher temperatures for longer.

### Toast

Convection: No

We began our Toast test on the Oster with the default toast level 4 and got pretty good results right off the bat. For good measure, we continued to try the toast level 3, which failed to color evenly within the stipulated time.

We then tried level 5 only to end up with burnt toast and not the expected deep brown shade. Regretfully, while level 4 was the best toast level, it didn’t score high on our benchmark scale—only 6/10.

On this setting—7 minutes 25 seconds on the timer—the four pieces of bread on the upper tray were toasted to a nice golden brown color. However, the color became dark towards the edges, especially where the bread was less dense.

Additionally, a large portion of the bottom right piece of toast was significantly lighter, possibly indicating a cold spot in the cooking chamber. With such unevenness, we could only score the surface color a 6/10 despite the overall golden brown hue.

Moreover, due to the lengthy toasting time, the toast became very crispy but dry on the inside. Our head chef, Tuyet Pham, said this crispiness would be great for eggs benedict and especially soup, but maybe not omelets and sandwiches. Unfortunately, the dark edges produced a bitter taste, preventing it from getting higher than a 6/10 from our chef.

We toasted the second batch of four slices immediately after the first. We chose level 4 again whereupon the oven automatically calibrated the timer to 5 minutes 31 seconds.

Since the oven was already hot, the aforementioned cold spot became less apparent. The toast was not as crispy nor dry as the first batch, which made it more suitable for sandwiches and omelets.

However, the burnt edges were still a problem, so the oven received one final 6/10 for consecutive usability. If you want better results for the second batch, we recommend decreasing the toast level by one.

### Pizza

30% \* 5.5 = 1.6

Function: Turbo Convection

Temperature: 450°F

Cooking Time: 6m

Convection: Yes

For this pizza test, we didn’t choose the oven’s 400°F pizza preset because it didn’t match our Pizza test requirement of 450°F. Instead, we chose Turbo Convection as a suitable setting for baking pizza. Nonetheless, the results were not so favorable scoring only 6.4/10 on our testing scale.

We were, however, impressed that the oven only took 6 minutes to bake a 9-inch thick-crust meat pizza placed on the upper rack level. According to our accumulated data on average toaster oven performance, this deserved a 9/10.

Unfortunately, the oven lacks the high-intensity heating capability needed to crisp a crust effectively in such a short period of time, which the [Toshiba AC25CEW-BS](https://healthykitchen101.com/toaster-ovens/reviews/toshiba/toshiba-ac25cew/) has. Consequently, parts of the crust bottom stuck to the grooves of the baking tray and the surface had a light golden color - so the score was only 5.5/10.

We had to stop baking because some of the meat and parts of the cheese started charring. It was a shame that the cheese didn’t completely melt before this, so we could only give the toppings a 6/10.

We were able to prevent the toppings from burning and the potential bitter taste. However, the crust and the topping weren’t good enough for the taste of the pizza to get a score higher than 5.5/10 from our chef.

### Whole Roasted Chicken

Convection: Yes

The spacious interior of the Oster seemed a key factor in our Whole Roasted Chicken test, scoring an impressive 8.1/10. We placed a 3 lb chicken belly-up on the upper rack level and flipped it after the first 40 minutes.

After 1 hour and 10 minutes, the skin reached an acceptable roasted color scoring a 7/10 for cooking time. Our chef surmised that further roasting wouldn’t result in better skin caramelization. Thus, we stopped roasting to avoid overcooking the meat and inadvertently lowering the total score.

The skin had an appetizing golden color, except for the sides of the two drumsticks which were a little lighter in color. Compared to other benchmark tests, the skin only crisped slightly indicating the heating elements and convection system to be less than ideal/top-of-the-range. The results were good, enough for a 7.5/10.

In conclusion, the oven maintained an ideal temperature long enough to evenly cook an entire chicken throughout. We measured the internal temperature of the chicken and it was 181°F. This was very surprising and almost spot-on with the recommended 165°F - 180°F by the USDA—thus earning a whopping 9.8/10 for doneness.

Interestingly, the meat came out so tender that the bone simply fell off as we tried to carve the chicken. If the skin was crispier, the chicken would have received a higher than 8/10 for taste.

### Baked French Fries

For our Baked French Fries test, the Oster was disappointing, scoring only 4.1/10. Our reasoning was the poor size ratio of the cooking chamber to the oven’s power output. The oven wasn’t able to maintain a high enough temperature for baking frozen fries, as opposed to the [Ninja DT201](https://healthykitchen101.com/toaster-ovens/reviews/ninja/ninja-foodi-xl-pro-air/).

After 30 minutes the fries showed no significant change in color—where the test time limit was 25 minutes! Therefore, we had no choice but to stop baking and give the fries a 0/10 for cooking time.

Most fries had a pale color as if they were air-dried instead of air-fried. Some small pieces had a light golden color, but that wasn’t enough to score higher than 5/10.

Texture-wise, the fries were soft but dry on the outside, barely enough for a 5.5/10. All things considered, the only silver lining was that the fries were cooked, so our chef gave them a 5/10 for taste.

The Oster TSSTTVFDDG is one of the largest capacity ovens we have tested. However, it lacks premium features often seen in the same price range including having more than 3 rack levels or a non-stick interior,e.g., the [Breville BOV845BSS](https://healthykitchen101.com/toaster-ovens/reviews/breville/breville-smart-oven-pro/). Features worth mentioning are good ventilation on all sides and the upper heating element.

Tray Indicators: No

Crumb Tray: Removable

Considering the Oster’s large size, ventilation slats on all sides are a big plus. (+3). At first glance, the most stand-out feature was the tempered glass french door with cool-touch door handles (+3).

It has a rear buffer to maintain a cool distance from the wall, but we thought it could be greater(+2). Additionally, while the oven’s leg stoppers are sturdy, they are rather small.

Our measurements of the oven’s footprints were 21.53" x 19.96" x 12.79" which matched closely with the manufacturer’s 22" x 19.5" x 13". On a side note, we weighed the oven and it was 16.75 lbs while the manufacturer stated the entire package to be 13.87 lbs.

### Control Panel

Audio Cues: No

The Oster has an LCD and 15 flat buttons including 8 for functions, 2 for timer adjustment, 2 for temperature adjustment, a Clock button, a Stop/Cancel button, and a Start button. The oven has an automatic interior light with no toggle button.

### Cooking Functions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/clbkb4psa000p9t88cstm5fna.jpg" alt="The eight cooking functions of the Oster TSSTTVFDDG Toaster Oven are in the center of the control panel. They include Toast, Bake, Broil, Turbo Convection, Pizza, Warm, Defrost, and Dehydrate. The oven’s right side has air ventilation holes." width="300px" height="200px">

*   Toast (level 1-6)
*   Bake (150°F-450°F)
*   Turbo Convection (150°F-450°F)
*   Broil (450°F)
*   Pizza (400°F)
*   Warm (150°F)
*   Defrost (150°F)
*   Dehydrate (150°F)

The Oster has eight cooking functions including Toast, Bake, Broil, Pizza, Warm, Defrost, Dehydrate, and Turbo Convection. Despite the name, Turbo Convection is basically Convection Bake—meaning this oven only has one convection level.

The standard Bake function and ‘Turbo’ Convection operate in the oven’s maximum temperature range, between 150°F to 450°F. The Toast function has 6 preset levels from Light to Dark, Meanwhile, the Pizza function is set to 400°F and Broil to 450°F—meaning neither can be adjusted.

The user manual recommends not to preheat the oven when using Defrost and Dehydrate. These two functions are set to 150°F—the lowest possible temperature —and cannot be adjusted. However, 150°F is a bit high compared to common dehydrators which operate at around 100°F.

For some reason, we couldn’t find the set temperature for Warm in the manual, but we measured the temperature to be 150°F.

### 7.0 - Interior

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/clbkba7kq000q9t8894ojfybb.jpg" alt="The cooking chamber of the Oster TSSTTVFDDG Toaster Oven has one nichrome heating element on top and two on the bottom, two rack levels, a shining light, and a fan cavity on the right wall." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/clbkbai3v000r9t88c6n95wr8.jpg" alt="The cooking chamber of the Oster TSSTTVFDDG Toaster Oven has one bent nichrome heating element on top and two straight ones on the bottom, two rack levels, a light, and a fan cavity on the right wall." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/clbkbaqzp000s9t889d6y99xn.jpg" alt="Two assembled guide rails on the right side of the Oster TSSTTVFDDG XL Digital French Door Convection Toaster Oven’s cooking chamber. A fan cavity is in between the two rails." width="300px" height="200px">

Heating Elements: 3 nichrome

Convection Fan: Yes

Lighting: Yes

Tray Levels: 2

Rotisserie: No

Safety Hook: No

The Oster uses three nichrome heating elements with an unusual looped design for the upper heating element (+3). Most similar [large-capacity ovens](https://healthykitchen101.com/toaster-ovens/reviews/best/large-toaster-ovens/) we have examined have four upper heating elements, two bottom heating elements, and a combined power draw of 1800 W.

However, the Oster has only one upper heating element which bends across and around the cooking chamber’s ceiling to cover the same area as would four. Since the power draw is divided equally between working heating elements, we speculated this design choice was to accommodate the oven’s lower power draw of 1500 W.

The TSSTTVFDDG claims to have ‘easy clean interior walls’. While they are not grease-proof, our cleaning test showed that the oven was, indeed, easy to clean (+1).

The convection fan is situated on the right side of the cooking chamber (+2). While the oven has an interior light, it’s fully automatic with no manual operation (+2).

Having only two rack levels, the oven doesn’t really require guides on the glass door (-1). The manual recommends using the upper rack position for toast and pizza, and the lower one for other foods. It’s worth noting that the rack guide rails are assembled parts and not hollowed out of the cooking chamber’s walls like many other toaster ovens.

The baking rack should not be slid into the lower rack slot with the baking tray attached to the bottom. This will result in direct contact with the bottom heating elements.

### Capacity

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/clbm33n2e00269t88euoegra8.jpg" alt="An opened front of the Oster TSSTTVFDDG XL Digital French Door Convection Toaster Oven on a white background. The cooking chamber is 15.75 inches long, 16.53 inches wide, and 10.04 inches high." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 15.8" (40.0 cm)

Width: 16.5" (42.0 cm)

Height: 10.0" (25.5 cm)

According to the manufacturer, the TSSTTVFDDG can take 14 slices of toast and two 16-inch pizzas on its two racks. However, our hands-on testing proved it fits only 12 slices (6 per rack, each requiring at least 4.5 x 4.5 inches of space) or a 15-inch pizza. While it wasn’t clear what the maximum size for a whole chicken was, our tests indicated plenty of room for a 3 lb bird.

The manufacturer doesn’t state the interior capacity, but we measured the cooking chamber volume to be around 42.83 liters—our biggest number to date. However, we felt only two rack slots didn’t do justice to the oven’s capacity.

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/clbkbjm3o000v9t888cjmetbq.jpg" alt="A two-pronged plug power cord. In the background is the Oster TSSTTVFDDG XL Digital French Door Convection Toaster Oven." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 25.8" (65.5 cm)

Type: 2-prong plug

Power: 1500 W

Rated Output: 120 V ~ 60 Hz

The power cord is 25.79" long which is enough for household use. However, it could be a bit longer since a toaster oven as large as the Oster requires at least 5 inches of clear space on all sides. The oven doesn’t have storage space for the cord like some ovens do.

### Accessories: Baking Rack x 2

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/clbkbqaj1000w9t887fgo07je.jpg" alt="A stainless steel baking rack with two supports below of the Oster TSSTTVFDDG XL Digital French Door Convection Toaster Oven on a white background." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/clbkbqig5000x9t88aac2hham.jpg" alt="A stainless steel baking rack of the Oster TSSTTVFDDG XL Digital French Door Convection Toaster Oven on a white background." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 15.7" (39.8 cm)

Width: 16.1" (41.0 cm)

Height: 0.7" (1.8 cm)

Material: Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

The Oster has two slightly different baking racks. One is the standard rack type, while the other has two supports below to slide the baking pan under.

### Accessories: Baking Pan

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/clbkdo21p00119t88god63bmy.jpg" alt="A silver baking pan of the Oster TSSTTVFDDG XL Digital French Door Convection Toaster Oven on a white background." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 14.13

Width: 11.8" (30.0 cm)

Height: 1.1" (2.9 cm)

Material: Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Not advisable

The baking pan has ridges and grooves for creating attractive roast markings and catching drippings. It also has wide edges for a firm fit on the baking rack supports, unlike some other designs we’ve seen.

However, it’s not big enough to fit into the rack rail guides and can only go on top of a rack or attached beneath. This means it doesn’t make full use of the oven’s capacity. In addition, the tray is coated, but not completely non-stick so prone to stubborn stains.

### Accessories: Removable Crumb Tray

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/clbkf6pjk00139t88ffqi7o9w.jpg" alt="A stainless steel removable crumb tray of the Oster TSSTTVFDDG XL Digital French Door Convection Toaster Oven on a white background." width="300px" height="200px">

A crumb tray is always a useful accessory to clean up pesky debris, especially with a large toaster oven like the Oster. Look out for crumbs falling onto the oven floor as you take out the tray. It’s quite a hassle to tilt the oven to get them out.

### 6.0 - Build Quality

Inside the cooking chamber, from the bottom up are one removable crumb tray, one baking rack, and one baking pan under another baking rack." width="300px" height="200px">

The TSSTTVFDDG is light for its size and has a graspable rectangular shape making it easy to carry or position on a counter (+2). It also has a sturdy build and durable stainless steel casing (+4). The LCD is black while the numbers are yellow and the settings are red, making everything easy to see (+1).

Unfortunately, we found that the flat buttons often required some force to register (-1). Moreover, the door hinge could be firmer thus preventing the door from slamming shut.

While the Oster TSSTTVFDDG is straightforward to use, it lacks premium features expected of similar-priced ovens including light and convection toggles as well as safety mechanisms.

### 8.0 - User Control

The Oster’s controls are easy to understand since what you see is what you get (+2). Therefore, the LCD doesn’t provide any extra information but it’s easy to read (+2).

The buttons have only a single function and are easy to tell apart(+2). Although the manual says you can press the Stop/Cancel button twice to turn off the oven, we weren’t able to do so (-1).

The temperature can be adjusted in increments of 5°F and the timer runs from one minute to six hours, which is quite impressive (+1). Time can be adjusted in increments of 1 minute up to 2 hours and in increments of 0.5 hours above 2 hours (+1).

To set up the clock, press the clock button once and the clock will flash. Then, use the arrow keys to set the hour and press the clock button again to likewise set the minutes. Finally, push the clock button or the start button to set the time (+1).

### 5.0 - Ease of Use

As you select a function, the corresponding icons will illuminate in the LCD screen. The TSSTTVFDDG has an automatic preheat phase which is only applicable for the Bake and Turbo Convection Bake functions (+1).

After setting the time and temperature, you then push start and the display will show PrE indicating the oven is in the preheating phase. You can bypass this phase by pressing the start button a second time.

Preheating takes roughly 5 minutes to around 300°F regardless of the temperature you set. You can readjust the time and temperature only after the preheating phase.

Interestingly, we found that the oven would return to preheat mode after adjusting the temperature until the new input temperature was reached and not just 300°F. This is also stated in the user manual.

The racks fit perfectly into the rail guides thus preventing accidents when placing food in the oven (+3). When the cooking cycle begins, the interior light will turn on automatically and then off when the cooking cycle ends (+2).

The french door and its cool-touch handle allow you to stay away from the heat wave when opening after cooking (+4). The doors are also single-pull which is very convenient. However, the doors cannot open partially and can slam shut if your hand slips (-2).

Unlike some ovens, opening the door doesn’t stop the oven or the interior light (-2). The oven casing can get very hot after long cooking times at high temperatures, so you should take care (-1).

When the cooking cycle finishes, the oven will beep once, switch off the heat, and return to the clock screen. It’s advised to unplug the oven after use.

### 7.5 - Cleanability

The stainless steel exterior of the Oster was very easy to clean (+2). Even though the interior doesn’t have a non-stick coating, there are no tricky nooks and crannies, so cleaning didn’t require much labor (+4).

After roasting a chicken, the baking pan accumulated some stubborn stains which we were able to remove even with a [baking soda paste](https://healthykitchen101.com/toaster-ovens/tips/how-to-clean-a-toaster-oven/) and water (+1.5). We were worried the grease could splash inside the fan cavity while cooking, but this was not the case.
