The black stainless steel Oster TSSTTVMNDG-SHP-2 Digital Convection Toaster Oven is suitable for someone looking for a simple and robust large unit. It has useful accessories and cooking functions for both seasoned home cooks and newcomers in the kitchen.

Features that we found helpful include the convenient slide-out crumb tray, internal lighting, and convection system. In addition, the overall design of the oven makes cleaning as straightforward as possible.

Throughout all of our test dishes, the oven’s performance is hindered by its low power output of 1300 W in ratio to its large capacity. In terms of ease of use, the buttons’ responsiveness can be improved.

The black stainless steel Oster TSSTTVMNDG-SHP-2 Digital Convection Toaster Oven is our first choice for a large unit. For $119.99, you’ll get a simple and robust toaster oven with a convenient slide-out crumb tray, internal lighting, useful accessories, and extra functions.

The strongest performance aspect of the Oster TSSTTVMNDG-SHP-2 was the even coloring on our test dishes, thanks to its convection system. However, it didn’t meet the mark in baking frozen french fries.

This was probably due to the low power output combined with the large capacity, unlike the picks on our [best toaster oven](https://healthykitchen101.com/toaster-ovens/reviews/best/) list. Moreover, having only two tray positions made it tricky to get the toast done right on both sides.

### Toast

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl8mnjk9c0000kc885ytq0x2k.jpg" alt="Oster TSSTTVMNDG-SHP-2 ToastFrom left to right, 24 pieces of toast for the top and bottom of three toast levels including lighter, medium, and darker." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl8mnjvq80001kc88e22t2boe.jpg" alt="The top and bottom of the best four pieces of toast from the Oster TSSTTVMNDG-SHP-2 6-Slice Digital Convection Toaster Oven." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl8mnk4qu0002kc88ca6j0bjm.jpg" alt="On the left are the top and bottom of four pieces of toast from the first batch, and on the right are from the second batch." width="300px" height="200px">

50% \* 7 = 3.5

Even Surface Color: 6

20% \* 6 = 1.2

Consecutive Usability: 5

30% \* 5 = 1.5

Function: Toast

Number of Slices: 4

Toast Level: 2/6

Cooking Time: 6m 43s

Second Batch: 4m18

Convection: No

Using the steps of our Toast test, we determined that level 2—6 minutes 43 seconds on the timer—was the best option, scoring a 6.2/10. In comparison, the toast at level 1 had a very light color, and the toast at level 3 had a dark brown color, with some dark patches.

The Toast Level 2 of the Oster produced four pieces with a golden brown color on the top. However, due to the unideal tray position, the toast was dark brown on the bottom. Even though the color was even, the big difference between the top and bottom resulted in a 6/10.

Due to the long cooking time, the first batch of toast was crispy outside but a bit dry inside, so it got a 7/10 for taste. Our head chef, Tuyet Pham, determined they would go well with eggs benedict, omelet, and soup, in particular, but not with sandwiches.

Even though this oven automatically deducted the toast timer to 4m 18s, the second batch was still significantly darker and drier. The color was also uneven, ranging from golden brown to dark, so it got a 5/10 for consecutive usability.

### Pizza

30% \* 8 = 2.4

Function: Bake

Temperature: 450°F

Cooking Time: 6m 50s

Convection: Yes

The Oster did very well in baking a 9-inch thick-crust meat pizza, but the evenness in caramelization could be improved. Thus, it received an 8/10 in total.

It only took 6m 50s to bake the pizza as opposed to 10 minutes on the label. In comparison to other toaster ovens in our Pizza test, it got a solid 8.2/10.

The crust had a nice golden brown color and since it was neither too soft nor too dry, it scored an 8/10. The cheese was melty and the toppings’ caramelization was about 80% even, so we gave it another 8/10. For its taste, our chef gave the pizza one final 8/10.

### Whole Roasted Chicken

40% \* 7.5 = 3.0

Function: Bake

Temperature: 350°F.

Cooking Time: 1h

Convection: Yes

Thanks to the Oster’s large capacity, we placed a 3 lb chicken on top of its broiling rack which is then set on top of the baking pan before we perform our Whole Roasted Chicken test. The overall score was 7.8/10.

The oven was able to roast the chicken in 1 hour, which was the standard amount of time needed, and deserved an 8/10. Thanks to the broiling rack and the oven’s convection system, the skin got an even golden color throughout. However, even with those advantages, the skin wasn’t able to crisp up much, so it got a 7/10. 

The chicken was fully cooked, but its internal temperature was a tad high at 190-192°F, so we gave it an 8.8/10. The meat was soft and juicy throughout, so it earned a 7.5/10 for taste from our chef.

### Baked French Fries

Cooking Time: 20 m

Convection: Yes

The Oster left a lot to be desired in baking french fries, thus scoring a 6/10.

The oven took 20 minutes to bake 12 oz of french fries. In comparison to other toaster ovens in our Baked French Fries test, it scored a 7.3/10.

The fries had an uneven color, ranging from almost none to golden and brown on the ends, so they got a 6.8/10. The fries were very soft so they could only get a 6/10 for texture. Our chef gave the fries a 5/10 for taste.

The Oster TSSTTVMNDG-SHP-2 has a simple and sturdy design, plus a convenient slide-out crumb tray. The large interior houses a togglable lightbulb and convection system. A consistent disadvantage that this oven has is its low wattage compared to something like the [Ninja DT201](https://healthykitchen101.com/toaster-ovens/reviews/ninja/ninja-foodi-xl-pro-air/).

Weight: 12.1 lbs (5.5 kg)

Length: 19.7" (50.0 cm)

Width: 15.2" (38.6 cm)

Height: 11.6" (29.5 cm)

Material: Stainless steel

Color: Black

Door Handle: cool-touch

Tray Indicators: No

Crumb Tray: Slide-out

The Oster has air ventilation holes on all sides of the convection system, which is a plus. In addition, having a slide-out tray is always helpful because it makes it easier to clean the oven.

Although the back buffers aren’t very sturdy, the bottom stands are and they also act as oven-carrying handles. Our measurements of the oven’s footprints were 19. 68" x 15.19" x 11.61" which were only slightly different in terms of width to the manufacturer’s provided 19.72" x 16.29" x 11.33".

### Control Panel

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl61lt7pb0014lj885ebcegc7.jpg" alt="The Oster TSSTTVMNDG-SHP-2 Convection Toaster Oven has an LCD and 15 flat buttons for 7 cooking functions and 8 features." width="300px" height="200px">

Type: LCD display + 15 buttons

Temperature: 150°F - 450°F

Timer: 1 minute - 90 minutes

Indicator Light: Yes

Status Bar: No

Light Toggle: Yes

Convection Toggle: No

Rotation Toggle: No

Automatic Preheat: No

Audio Cues: No

The Oster has an LCD digital display and 15 buttons, including 8 functions, 2 to adjust time, 2 to adjust temperature, a light toggle, a clock feature, a stop and a start button. The built-in clock is something you rarely see in a toaster oven, but we’ve seen some comments about it, usually pointing out that the clock is ahead of time by 5 minutes.

### Cooking Functions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl6hggcn4001gek881i5he0he.jpg" alt="The Oster TSSTTVMNDG-SHP-2 has 7 cooking functions including Toast, Bake, Convection Bake, Broil, Warm, Defrost, and Pizza." width="300px" height="200px">

*   Toast
*   Bake
*   Convection Bake
*   Broil
*   Warm
*   Defrost (150°F)
*   Pizza (400°F)

You can only adjust the temperature on the Bake and Convection Bake functions, which should be good enough for experienced cooks. Other functions have their temperature predetermined by the manufacturer, which can be useful for beginners in the kitchen. 

For some reason, the user manual doesn’t specify the predetermined temperature for the Warm function. Nonetheless, we were able to measure it to be around 180°F, which was unfortunately quite high for its purpose. Other toaster ovens with the Warm function usually maintain around 80°F-100°F.

### 6.0 - Interior

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl61lvkkf0015lj88ftxve8d3.jpg" alt="The Oster TSSTTVMNDG-SHP-2 Oven’s cooking chamber has 4 nichrome heating elements, 2 guide rails, a light, and a fan cavity." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl61lvt4l0016lj884m4o8nng.jpg" alt="The cooking chamber’s right wall of the Oster TSSTTVMNDG-SHP-2 Toaster Oven has 2 guide rails, a light, and a fan cavity." width="300px" height="200px">

Heating Elements: 4 nichrome

Convection Fan: Yes

Lighting: Yes

Tray Levels: 2

Rotisserie: No

Safety Hook: No

The Oster has four standard nichrome heating elements but only two tray levels—unlike the similar-sized [Cosori CO130-AO](https://healthykitchen101.com/toaster-ovens/reviews/cosori/cosori-air-fryer/) that has three. In addition to a convection system, it has internal lighting which is always useful, especially when you can choose when to turn it on and off.

### Capacity

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/clbm2kr7v001x9t887tg34yw7.jpg" alt="An opened front of the Oster TSSTTVMNDG-SHP-2 Large Convection Toaster Oven with interior measurements on a white background." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 14.2" (36.1 cm)

Width: 12.6" (32.0 cm)

Height: 9.4" (24.0 cm)

Its [spacious interior](https://healthykitchen101.com/toaster-ovens/reviews/best/large-toaster-ovens/) can accommodate 6 slices of toast, a 12-inch pizza, and more than a 3 lb chicken. While the manufacturer didn’t state the exact capacity, we measured the cooking chamber’s volume to be around 28 liters.

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl61lxmzg0017lj8804xl8ege.jpg" alt="A two-pronged plug power cord. In the background is the Oster TSSTTVMNDG-SHP-2 6-Slice Large Digital Convection Toaster Oven." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 26.0" (66.0 cm)

Type: 2-prong plug

Power: 1300 W

Rated Output: 120 V ~ 60 Hz

Since the power cord is positioned at the bottom of the oven, it may have some inconvenient bends. The length of roughly 25.98" is adequate for household use but not enough to wrap around the back buffers.

### Accessories: Baking Rack

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl61lzmin0018lj88ajwf13ys.jpg" alt="A stainless steel baking rack of the Oster TSSTTVMNDG-SHP-2 6-Slice Digital Convection Toaster Oven on a grey background." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 14.2" (36.1 cm)

Width: 15.0" (38.1 cm)

Height: 0.2" (0.5 cm)

Material: Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

The rack fits perfectly with the guide rails and helps reduce the chance of an accident when you put food in the oven.

### Accessories: Baking Pan

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl61m1gu90019lj889j2b7yrd.jpg" alt="A enamel baking pan of the Oster TSSTTVMNDG-SHP-2 Large Capacity Digital Convection Toaster Oven on a grey background." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 12.9" (32.7 cm)

Width: 10.5" (26.7 cm)

Height: 1.2" (3.0 cm)

Material: Stainless steel with enamel coating

Dishwasher Safe: Not advisable

The baking pan goes hand-in-hand with the broiling rack to catch the drippings and meat juice. Its enamel coating makes it more resistant to stains and caramelized bits but it is not advisable to put the baking pan in the dishwasher.

However, it’s slightly smaller than the oven’s capacity and therefore, does not make the most of the space. Nonetheless, it still does the job of preventing any hot mess from dirtying the heating elements which can lead to fire danger.

### Accessories: Broiling Rack

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl61m35v4001alj88duzigrbk.jpg" alt="A stainless steel broiling rack of the Oster TSSTTVMNDG-SHP-2 6-Slice Digital Convection Toaster Oven on a grey background." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 10.9" (27.7 cm)

Width: 8.5" (21.7 cm)

Height: 1.2" (3.1 cm)

Material: Stainless steel

Dishwasher Safe: Not advisable

The broiling rack has an elevation from the baking pan to allow for heat circulation around the food. However, it’s not firmly attached to the baking pan, so be careful when you move this combo around. In addition, the rack doesn’t have a coating, which may make it prone to caramelized bits, stains, and discoloration.

### 6.0 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl6evsguf000oek883nmu0rhk.jpg" alt="The front of an opened Oster TSSTTVMNDG-SHP-2 Large Convection Toaster Oven with an oven rack, baking pan, and broiling rack." width="300px" height="200px">

Though it is made from durable materials and has a sturdy build, the Oster isn’t heavy for its size. The digital display is clear, but the flat buttons can be irresponsive at times; this seems to be a common problem for Oster units, as the [Oster TSSTTVFDDG](https://healthykitchen101.com/toaster-ovens/reviews/oster/oster-tssttvfddg/) also suffers from it.

Throughout the testing procedure, we found that the oven’s power output of 1300 W may have offset its large capacity. Our speculation was that its performance efficiency could increase with 1800 W.

Usability: Needs Better Control
-------------------------------

usability Scores: **NaN**

*   User Control (30%) - **6.0**/undefined
    
*   Ease of Use (50%) - **6.0**/undefined
    
*   Cleanability (20%) - **9.0**/undefined
    

While the digital control panel of the Oster TSSTTVMNDG-SHP-2 is straightforward and easy to use, its buttons can be more responsive. In addition to that, having to press Cancel before changing functions can get annoying.

The convection fan isn’t all-applicable, but it’s not a problem. On the other hand, the oven’s design features, including its accessories, make cleaning an effortless exercise.

### 6.0 - User Control

For the Oster, the temperature can be adjusted in increments of 10°F. The timer can be adjusted in increments of 30 seconds when it’s below 10 minutes and in increments of 1 minute after 10 minutes. The convection fan isn’t all-applicable, but you can adjust time and temperature according to your preference on Convection Bake.

### 6.0 - Ease of Use

The Oster doesn’t beep with each press of a button which isn’t normally an issue. However, because the buttons weren’t always responsive, we had to check the display with each press and this required us to do so more than once.

One thing to keep in mind is that the oven requires you to press Cancel before changing the cooking function. After the cooking cycle finishes, the digital display will show END and the oven will sound 4 beeps 3 times. You’ll then need to press Cancel before performing further inputs.

The oven’s exterior only gets hot to the touch after a long period of cooking at a high temperature (> 400°F). The door can easily be kept partially open, but it doesn’t stop the cooking process, unlike some other ovens.

The built-in clock will keep ticking as long as the oven’s plugged in, but the power consumption should be minimal. Thus, it’s up to you to keep the oven plugged in or to remove it.

### 9.0 - Cleanability

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl61m7h79001blj88272w701z.jpg" alt="Grease on the glass door of a closed stainless steel Oster TSSTTVMNDG-SHP-2 6-Slice Large Digital Convection Toaster Oven." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl61m7ub3001clj88fjttb3db.jpg" alt="Grease on the stainless steel Oster TSSTTVMNDG-SHP-2 6-Slice Large Digital Convection Toaster Oven’s cooking chamber wall." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl61m868s001dlj885jdrhe6x.jpg" alt="Grease and chicken skin stuck to the enamel baking pan of the Oster TSSTTVMNDG-SHP-2 6-Slice Digital Convection Toaster Oven." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/toaster-ovens/cl61m8llv001elj8846uicd88.jpg" alt="The cleaned enamel baking pan of the stainless steel Oster TSSTTVMNDG-SHP-2 6-Slice Large Digital Convection Toaster Oven." width="300px" height="200px">

The Oster has an internal and external coating. There are no tricky nooks and crannies. The slide-out crumb tray made cleaning up the crumbs very easy but we still had to tilt the oven to remove all of them.

Although some grease splashed inside the oven during our Whole Roasted Chicken test, we could easily clean it up using the instructions in our toaster oven cleaning guide. The baking pan, even with the enamel coating, sustained some stubborn burnt bits and stains that required brushing with a paste of baking soda and water.
