If you're looking for an affordable and easy-to-use faucet-mount water filter, the PUR Plus FM2500V may be a good option for you.

It offers excellent chlorine filtering ability, is easy and convenient to use, and can be quickly installed and serviced. However, its low flow rate in filtering mode can be problematic if you’re looking for a filter that can offer a high-pressure stream of clean water on demand.

And while the design looks fairly aesthetically pleasing, the plastic housing may not be as durable as the pricier models with stainless steel housing.

**Things We Like**

*   Excellent chlorine filtering ability
*   Easy installation and servicing with "one-click" system
*   Lightweight and compact design
*   A filter change indicator

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Low flow rate in filtering mode
*   Weak grip on faucet due to the one-click system
*   Flimsy routing valve’s handle
*   The plastic construction can be problematic for long-term durability

Thanks to its highly successful lines of water-filtering pitchers, PUR has been one of the top brands in the [residential-grade water filtering](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-filters/reviews/best/) industry for years. And if you’re looking for a faucet water filter to upgrade your kitchen, the company has options in its catalog for you, too.

In this article, we’ll be taking a look at one of the more popular options: the PUR Plus FM2500V. Though its performance wasn’t quite as good as we had hoped, it’s still a very compelling option compared to the other [best water faucet filters](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-filters/reviews/best/faucet-water-filters/) on the market.

Performance
-----------

performance Scores: **6.8**

*   Chlorine Test (40%) - **10**/10
    
*   Flow Rate Test (60%) - **4.7**/10
    

Before testing the FM2500V, we tested the [PUR Plus PFM3500V](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-filters/reviews/pur/pur-pfm350v-faucet-filter/), which uses the same filtering cartridge as this model. So, right out of the gate, we already expected their performance to be similar to one another.

And indeed, their results are fairly similar: the PUR Faucet Water Filter (FM2500V) has excellent chlorine filtering ability (it was able to take out all traces of the chemical in the chlorinated water we pumped through it.)

However, its flow rate in filtering mode wasn’t good. At 0.3 GPM, it failed our flow rate test with — at the moment — the lowest score of all models we’ve tested.

### Chlorine Test

Before: 10+ mg/l

After: ~0 mg/l

The PUR Plus FM2500V has excellent chlorine filtering ability. It was able to eliminate all traces of the chemical from the highly-chlorinated water that we pumped through it.

Our test kit read a 10+ mg/l concentration of chlorine in the test water. After passing through the filter, the kit detected no trace of chlorine at all (~0 mg/l).

### Flow Rate Test

Duration: 20 secs

Amount: 0.148 gallons

Flow Rate: 0.44 GPM

Similar to the PUR Plus PFM3500V, the flow rate of the PUR Plus FM2500V when switched to filtering mode is unacceptably low.

We installed the filter to a high-pressure faucet that outputs around 2.2 GPM. When switched to filtering mode, the filter could only output around 0.3 GPM, significantly lower than our minimum passing score of 0.5 GPM.

For people who are used to having high-pressure water in the kitchen, using the PUR Plus FM2500V can be an annoyance. Instead, we recommend looking at models like the [Waterdrop WD-FC-06](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-filters/reviews/waterdrop/waterdrop-wd-fc-06/) or the [Brita Basic](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-filters/reviews/brita/brita-basic-faucet-mount/), which offer much higher flow rates in filtration mode.

Design
------

design Scores: **7.8**

*   Housing Build Quality (40%) - **7.5**/10
    
*   Filter Piece (50%) - **8.5**/10
    
*   Routing Valve (10%) - **6.0**/10
    

The build quality of the PUR water filter faucet (FM2500V) is quite high. We found no noticeable design or manufacturing flaws in the unit we received.

However, we have reservations about the fully-plastic construction of the housing. It doesn’t bode well for the filter’s long-term durability (there is a pricier version made from stainless steel that you can check out, called [PUR Plus FM4000B](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G15AA30?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=lunagfwf8-20&linkId=5dab48428a6e0a16ced332459ada795e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl), which should be more durable and last longer.)

### In the Box

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/pur-faucet-water-filter-fm2500v-box-clemg4hhk00176s8802sb5k3q.jpg" alt="The grey PUR PFM350V filter is in the middle, surrounded by its accessories, manuals, and the shipping box." width="300px" height="200px">

*   No. of Accessories: 3

The shipping box of the PUR Plus FM2500V is very simplistic (almost surprisingly so.) In a cardboard box with a printed decal at the front are:

*   The filter housing
*   A PUR Plus filter cartridge
*   Four faucet adapters
*   Paperwork

### Weight & Dimensions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/pur-faucet-water-filter-fm2500v-dimensions-clemcui6l00106s882u92f8iw.jpg" alt="The dimensions of the PUR Plus FM2500V. Its length is 6.5 inches, width is 2.5 inches, and height is 5.5 inches." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 6.5" (16.5 cm)

Width: 2.5" (6.4 cm)

Height: 5.5" (14.0 cm)

Weight: 1 pound

The PUR Plus FM2500V is fairly compact. With dimensions of 6.5 inches in length, 2.5 inches in width, and 5.5 inches in height, the filter is small enough to fit on most standard faucets without taking up too much of your sink’s space.

Additionally, thanks to the plastic construction, the filter only weighs 1 pound. It won't weigh down your faucet, which can be a plus if you have an old faucet.

### 7.5 - Housing Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/pur-faucet-water-filter-fm2500v-housing-build-quality-clemg7kja00186s883lt65akg.jpg" alt="The grey, plastic PUR Plus FM2500V faucet-mount filter on its side on a grey table." width="300px" height="200px">

PUR products have always been known for their excellent build quality; the PUR water filter faucet (FM2500V) is no exception. We have thoroughly inspected the filter's exterior and interior components, looking for any visible flaws in design or manufacturing. However, we could not find anything notable to write about.

While the housing is impeccably built, the plastic material is still a drawback. This material may be less durable than pricier models with stainless steel housing.

Fortunately, the manufacturer offers a stainless steel version of this exact model ([PUR Plus FM4000B](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G15AA30?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=lunagfwf8-20&linkId=5dab48428a6e0a16ced332459ada795e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)) for those who want a filter that should last a bit longer.

### 8.5 - Filter Piece

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/pur-faucet-water-filter-fm2500v-filter-piece-clemg8hun00196s885bd21eu0.jpg" alt="The plastic, blue-colored filter cartridge of the PUR Plus FM2500V standing upright on a grey table." width="300px" height="200px">

Filter Model: PUR Plus MineralCore™

Filtration Process: Activated Carbon, Ion Exchange Resin & MineralCore™

Certifications: ANSI Standard 42, 53, 401

Filter Capacity: 100 gallons

The PUR Plus FM2500V uses the same filter cartridge as the PUR Plus PFM3500V.

The key feature of this filter piece is its triple-layer filter system.

*   1st layer: Made of activated carbon, which is effective at removing [organic pollutants](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318985753_The_use_of_activated_carbons_for_removing_organic_matter_from_groundwater) like herbicides and pesticides.
*   2nd layer: Made of ion exchange resin, which effectively eliminates [inorganic pollutants](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305658612_ION_EXCHANGE_RESINS) like chlorine and heavy metals (such as lead.)
*   3rd layer: Uses PUR's patented MineralCore™ technology, which helps enhance your water's taste and quality by adding extra (beneficial) minerals to the water.

Despite the impressive filtration capabilities of the PUR Plus PFM350V, one potential downside is its low filter capacity. With a capacity of only 100 gallons, the filter must be replaced every 1-2 months, depending on your daily water usage.

### 6.0 - Routing Valve

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/pur-faucet-water-filter-fm2500v-routing-valve-1-clemgjkda001e6s8857v4c636.jpg" alt="The handle of the PUR Plus FM2500V’s routing valve in the horizontal position." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/pur-faucet-water-filter-fm2500v-routing-valve-clemgage6001a6s88e7fyd2o3.jpg" alt="The handle of the PUR Plus FM2500V is in the vertical position, activating the water filtering mode." width="300px" height="200px">

Type of Valve: Rotating

The handle for the routing valve is a black plastic piece to the side of the filter. In the vertical position, tap water bypasses the filter and isn’t filtered. You can flick the handle down to the horizontal position when using filtered water. This will activate the routing valve, redirecting the water flow through the filter cartridge for cleansing. Clean water will come from the smaller nozzle underneath the filter compartment.

This design can help you extend the filter’s lifespan by ensuring filtered water is only produced when needed.

But while the handle functions just fine, it’s made from very thin plastic and feels very flimsy. The handle could be easily snapped off if you flick it with too much force.

The PUR water filter faucet (FM2500V) — like most faucet-mount filters — is extremely to use once properly installed.

PUR gives this filter a special “one-click installation” system, simplifying installation greatly. However, compared to faucet-mount filters that use a more traditional swivel collar locking mechanism, the PUR FM2500V’s grip on the faucet is less secure.

As for ease of use, the only needs to learn the flipping motion of the routing valve’s handle, and that’s that. After 1-2 months, the replacement process is straightforward once the filter has run its course (the filter includes a filter change indicator at the front that can tell you exactly when you need to change it out.)

### 8.5 - Installation

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/pur-faucet-water-filter-fm2500v-installation-clemgbj54001b6s88dn78cp0z.jpg" alt="A close-up shot of the PUR Plus FM2500V’s mounting port when mated with a metal faucet adapter." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/pur-faucet-water-filter-fm2500v-installation-1-clemgd981001c6s8804z298cu.jpg" alt="The PUR Plus FM2500V leans backward when mounted on the faucet." width="300px" height="200px">

The PUR FM2500V comes with a special “one-click installation” system. Basically, it’s composed of a faucet adapter that you have to swivel onto your faucet’s head (even if you have a faucet with external threading.)

Once the adapter is installed, align the mounting port of the filter with the adapter, then push firmly upward. There are catches in the mounting port that will latch onto the adapter and keep the filter in place.

While it does take more steps to install than other faucet filters, removal of the filter housing for filter changes in the future will be far less work. Press the two white release buttons simultaneously on either side of the mounting port, and the filter will come off.

However, while it’s certainly more convenient, we noticed that the filter’s grip on the faucet is weak. On our faucet (which is curved,) we can’t get the PUR FM2500V to stay straight and center. Instead, the filter tips backward until it hits the faucet. As a result, the filter doesn’t look very flattering on our test bench (if you have similarly curved faucet at home, you may want to reconsider before buying this model.)

### 10 - Ease of Use

The FM2500V is easy to use. Working the routing valve’s handle is the only motion the user needs to learn, with the horizontal position (up) being unfiltered mode and the vertical position (down) being filtering more.

Once every 1-2 months, the filter change indicator will flash to remind you of changing out the filter for a new one.

### 10 - Leak

The PUR Plus PFM350V didn’t leak during our tests.

### 8.0 - Maintenance

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/pur-faucet-water-filter-fm2500v-maintenance-clemggepw001d6s88320vabb3.jpg" alt="The filter change indicator light on the PUR Plus FM2500V faucet-mount water filter." width="300px" height="200px">

Filter Indicator: Yes

Replacement: 1-2 months

The PUR water filter faucet (FM2500V) has a filter change indicator at the front of the unit. When water passes through the filter cartridge, the light will flash green six times. The light will turn yellow as the filter nears the end of its service life. And once the filter is spent and has to be changed, the light will turn red.

According to PUR, the filter should last around 3 months. However, we expect the filter to only last for around 1-2 months at most, considering its low capacity of 100 gallons.

As of February 2023, the replacement filter is still available and can be purchased in packs of 3.
