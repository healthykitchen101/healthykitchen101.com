The PUR Plus PFM350V is a good water filter as far as performance goes in [our list](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-filters/reviews/best/faucet-water-filters/). Although its filtering flow rate leaves much to be desired, the chlorine filtering performance of the filter was definitely up to code in our test.

The design of the filter was made from plastic, which means its long-term durability can be a little bit concerning. However, we really liked the compact and trendy design of the filter. It’ll blend in and accentuate the design of most kitchens (especially contemporary ones.)

It is both easy to install and to use and didn’t leak once in our various tests.

**Things We Like**

*   Excellent chlorine filtering ability
*   Sleek and compact design with a very modern aesthetic
*   Has a filter indicator light
*   Easy to install and use

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Filter has a low capacity (100 gallons)
*   Housing is built entirely from plastic, which can be a durability issue in the long-term

PUR is one of the premier names in the residential water filtering market segment, having endeared itself to consumers with its successful water filtering pitcher lines. It’s not at all surprising when we learned that PUR also offers faucet filters, too.

So, how well do the faucet-mount filters in PUR live up to the successes of their pitcher filters?

For the past week, we’ve tested the PUR Plus PFM350V in the lab alongside other [water filters](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-filters/reviews/best/) on the market. And while the test results weren’t as good as we had hoped, PUR still did a decent job with this filter. If you plan to pick up a unit yourself, this review can tell you everything you need to know before you click the order button!

Performance
-----------

performance Scores: **6.8**

*   Chlorine Test (40%) - **10**/10
    
*   Flow Rate Test (60%) - **4.7**/10
    

As expected from PUR, the filter cartridge they shipped with the PFM350V did a great job of filtering out chemicals like chlorine. In our test, it was able to remove nearly all traces of free chlorine in the highly-chlorinated water that we pumped through the filter.

Our only issue with the PFM350V is its low flow rate in filtering mode. Specifically, when switched to filtering mode, the filter only outputs around 0.44 GPM (the faucet we attached it to has a flow rate of 2.2 GPM). **Currently, the PUR Plus PFM350V is one of the slowest filters in our database.**

### Chlorine Test

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/pur-plus-faucet-filter-pfm350v-chlorine-test-clpwcymln000dmu88hgdvhy25.jpg" alt="The PUR Plus PFM350V filter mounted on a tap. To its left is the testing result pad with two activated test strips." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/pur-plus-faucet-filter-pfm350v-chlorine-test-thumbnail-clei23tgg000w6s887qg9bd6g.jpg" alt="PUR PLUS Faucet Filter Chlorine Test" width="300px" height="200px">

Before: 10+ mg/l

After: ~0 mg/l

As expected, the PUR did very well in this test. We pumped highly-chlorinated water with a reading of 10+ mg/l of chlorine concentration through the filter, then collected the purified water outputted. Testing the water filtered by the PFM350V with a testing kit showed a value of around 0 mg/l, denoting near-perfect filtration efficiency.

### Flow Rate Test

Duration: 20 secs

Amount: 0.148 gallons

Flow Rate: 0.44 GPM

The PUR Plus PFM350V filter has a slow flow rate when used in filtering mode. We tested it on a high-pressure faucet with a maximum flow rate of 2.2 GPM and found that the filter's speed decreased to 0.44 GPM when switched to filtering mode. This is lower than the minimum speed of 0.5 GPM required to pass our test.

As a result, the PUR Plus PFM350V failed this portion of the test. If you’re used to having high-pressure tap water in your kitchen, we would recommend looking at faster-working models, such as the [Waterdrop WD-FC-06](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-filters/reviews/waterdrop/waterdrop-wd-fc-06/) or the [Brita Basic](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-filters/reviews/brita/brita-basic-faucet-mount/) filter.

Design
------

design Scores: **8.4**

*   Build Quality (40%) - **7.8**/10
    
*   Filter Piece (50%) - **8.5**/10
    
*   Routing Valve (10%) - **10**/10
    

The PUR Plus PFM350V is made entirely from plastic, which will usually get a downvote from us on grounds of durability. But we’re really taken by its design: the sleek and modern form factor and the slate gray color of the plastic housing makes it a perfect fit for contemporary kitchens.

The filter compartment is also designed uniquely. When the filter is mounted on the faucet, the large, bulbous filter compartment is laid horizontally instead of vertically, like in other filters we’ve tested. This means the filter won't obstruct your use of the faucet.

### In the Box

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/pur-plus-faucet-filter-pfm350v-box-clef7axfm000e6s885jv99ksa.jpg" alt="The grey PUR PFM350V filter is in the middle, surrounded by its accessories, manuals, and the shipping box." width="300px" height="200px">

*   No. of Accessories: 3

The content of the PUR Plus PFM350V’s shipping box is fairly minimalistic. Besides the filter, there are three faucet adapters and paperwork.

In total, the box includes:

*   The filter
*   The filter cartridge
*   Three faucet adapters (one from plastic, two from metal)
*   Manuals and warranty card

### Weight & Dimensions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/pur-plus-faucet-filter-pfm350v-dimension-clee3t71i000a6s88duhre4pr.jpg" alt="The dimensions of the PUR Plus PFM350V. The length is 6.5 inches, the width is 5.25 inches, and the height is 2.8 inches." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 6.5" (16.5 cm)

Width: 5.3" (13.3 cm)

Height: 2.8" (7.1 cm)

Weight: 1.1 lbs (0.5 kg)

The dimensions of the PUR Plus PFM350V are different from all the other filters we reviewed. It's wider than all the models in our database, measuring 5.25 inches, while most are only between 2 to 2.7 inches. Its height is also different, measuring only 2.8 inches, whereas other models are between 4.3 to 5.5 inches.

Essentially, the PUR Plus PFM350V is flatter than most filters on the market, with most of its parts angling horizontally instead of vertically.

This design makes it very user-friendly. When the filter is installed on the faucet, the filter compartment is laid horizontally, pointing backward and away from the user. As a result, the filter won't be in the way when the user is using it.

The filter weighs 1.1 pounds, which is decent.

### 7.8 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/pur-plus-faucet-filter-pfm350v-build-quality-clef7bypp000f6s886d9rcf4s.jpg" alt="The front of the grey, plastic PUR Plus PFM350V filter, which is sitting on a white stone table." width="300px" height="200px">

Due to the plastic construction, long-term durability can potentially be a problem with this filter variant. Fortunately, PUR sells a version of the PFM350V made from stainless steel ([PFM350S](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KWRBFPO?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=lunagfwf7-20&linkId=5dab48428a6e0a16ced332459ada795e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)). It’s a bit pricier, but durability will definitely be a marked improvement over this variant with a plastic housing painted “metallic grey.”

Besides the problem with the build material, PUR did a great job designing and manufacturing the PFM350V. All the components look and feel solid, and our reviewers didn’t find any visible flaws or defects. We also didn’t spot any design problem that could affect the durability or usability of the filter, either.

### 8.5 - Filter Piece

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/pur-plus-faucet-filter-pfm350v-filter-piece-clef7d0ag000g6s88903zcslz.jpg" alt="The blue plastic-shelled PUR Plus filter cartridge that comes with the PUR Plus PFM350V standing upright on a white table." width="300px" height="200px">

Filter Model: PUR Plus MineralCore™

Filtration Process: Activated Carbon, Ion Exchange Resin & MineralCore™

Certifications: ANSI Standard 42, 53, 401

Filter Capacity: 100 gallon

PUR definitely put a lot of work into making sure that their filter not only works but also works well. The filter has three layers, one of activated carbon, the second of ion exchange resin, and the last is PUR’s patented MineralCore™ technology.

The first two layers are for purification, with activated carbon great at taking out [organic pollutants](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318985753_The_use_of_activated_carbons_for_removing_organic_matter_from_groundwater) (herbicides, pesticides, etc.) and the ion exchange resin very effective at eliminating [chlorine, metals, and inorganic pollutants](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305658612_ION_EXCHANGE_RESINS) (arsenic, atrazine, etc.)

As such, the PUR Plus offers well-rounded protection against all the threats lurking in your tap water.

Our only issue with the PUR Plus PFM350V’s filter piece is its low capacity. At only 100 gallons, the filter will last around 1-2 months, depending on how much filtered water you use daily.

### 10 - Routing Valve

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/pur-plus-faucet-filter-pfm350v-routing-valve-clef7e5fm000h6s8828eocd4x.jpg" alt="A close-up shot on the black rotating handle of the PUR Plus PFM350V faucet-mount water filter." width="300px" height="200px">

Type of Valve: Rotating

There is a black handle on the side of the filter that controls the routing valve. When you need filtered water for drinking, flick it downward, and the routing valve will direct the tap water through the filter cartridge and purify it for you. Then, when you’re finished, switch the handle upward to the horizontal position again, and the valve will let the tap water pass through as normal and unfiltered.

This will ensure that filtered water is only produced when you need it and extend the lifespan of your filter cartridge.

The routing valve is very well-designed. It fits seamlessly with the rest of the housing when it's in the horizontal position design. It could be easily mistaken as just a part of the housing if it wasn't painted black!

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **9.8**

*   Installation (25%) - **10**/10
    
*   Ease of Use (30%) - **10**/10
    
*   Leak (35%) - **10**/10
    
*   Maintenance (10%) - **8.0**/10
    

Like most faucet-mount water filters, there’s only one motion that you need to learn to use the PUR Plus PFM350V once it’s installed on the faucet: switching the routing valve’s handle up and down to get either filtered or unfiltered water. So, usability-wise, the PFM350V is excellent.

But this model further stands out from the rest by having an extra indicator light at the front that tells you exactly when your filter has maxed out its capacity and needs to be replaced. It makes maintaining the filter much less of a hassle.

### 10 - Installation

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/pur-plus-faucet-filter-pfm350v-installation-clef7f61n000i6s885l488dsq.jpg" alt="The mounting port of the PUR Plus PFM350V, with the black plastic ring and the metal threading on the inside." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/pur-plus-faucet-filter-pfm350v-installation-1-clef7mjrp000l6s883k69cjk2.jpg" alt="The mounting port of the PUR Plus PFM350V attached with a metal faucet adapter." width="300px" height="200px">

If your faucet has external threading, installation only consists of fitting the mounting port with the head of your faucet, then tightening the black plastic ring until the filter is solidly anchored.

For those with internal threading faucets, fit the right faucet adapter that comes in the box with the filter to your faucet first. Then, you can mount the filter like normal to the faucet.

### 10 - Ease of Use

The PFM350V has excellent ease of use. After it’s installed, the user only needs to switch back and forth to the routing valve to get either unfiltered or filtered water. Then, once every 1-2 months or when the indicator light goes off to show that the filter cartridge is spent, you can order a new cartridge and replace the old one.

### 10 - Leak

The PUR Plus PFM350V didn’t leak during any of our tests.

### 8.0 - Maintenance

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/pur-plus-faucet-filter-pfm350v-maintenance-clef7gk58000j6s884n44gdx0.jpg" alt="The bar of filter change indicator light on the PUR Plus PFM350V faucet-mount filter." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/pur-plus-faucet-filter-pfm350v-maintenance-1-clef7jdox000k6s88gi7wc853.jpg" alt="The blue, plastic-shelled filter cartridge of the PUR Plus PFM350V surrounded by detached plastic parts of the filter." width="300px" height="200px">

Filter Indicator: Yes

Replacement: 1-2 months

Maintaining the PUR Plus PFM350V is made all the more simple by the small indicator light at the front of the filter housing. When water passes through the filter cartridge, the light will flash green. The light will turn yellow or orange when the filter nears the end of its service life. And once the filter has expired and needs to be replaced immediately, the light will turn red.

The filter cartridge of the PUR Plus PFM350V is said to last around 3 months by PUR. However, with a maximum capacity of 100 gallons, we expect it will only last around 1-2 months for most households.

As of February 2023, the replacement filter is still widely available and can be purchased in packs of 3.
