The Waterdrop WD-FC-01 will be a good purchase for all. With its affordable pricing, high flow rate, and certifiably great filtering performance against chlorine, it’s currently one of the [top choices](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-filters/reviews/best/) out there value-wise.

The overall design of this [faucet-mount water filter](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-filters/reviews/best/faucet-water-filters/) is great, with a unique design and installation system. However, its long-term durability can be questionable as it's made from plastic.

The filter is easy to use, like most filters on the market.

**Things We Like**

*   Excellent chlorine filtration efficiency.
*   High filtering flow rate.
*   Unique design and installation system.
*   Replacement filter is readily available.

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   While unique, the installation system of the filter is hard to figure out.
*   Plastic construction makes long-term durability a concern.

The WD-FC-01 is the second faucet-mount water filter from Waterdrop that we’ve put to the test. Fortunately, just like its sibling — the WD-FC-06 — this unit also performs excellently.

Despite being at half the price, it still does a great job filtering out chlorine during our performance test compared to all the other water filters we’ve tested. And later, in the flow rate test, the WD-FC-01 had one of our database's fastest filtering flow rates, second only to the [Waterdrop WD-FC-06](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-filters/reviews/waterdrop/waterdrop-wd-fc-06/) (as of January 2023).

Here is our complete test report on the Waterdrop WD-FC-01’s performance, design, and ease of use!

Performance
-----------

performance Scores: **9.2**

*   Chlorine Test (40%) - **9.5**/10
    
*   Flow Rate Test (60%) - **9.0**/10
    

The overall performance of the Waterdrop WD-FC-01 is very good. In the chlorine filtration test, the filter removed nearly 100% of the free chlorine in the chlorinated water we pumped through it.

As for the filtering flow rate, at 1.29 GPM, the WD-FC-01 is one of the fastest-working faucet filters in our database (second just to its sibling, the Waterdrop WD-FC-06).

### Chlorine Test

Before: 10+ mg/l

After: ~0.1-0.5 mg/l

The Waterdrop-WD-FC-01 exhibits great chlorine filtering ability in our test. We pumped highly-chlorinated water (with a total chlorine level of 10+ mg/l) through the filter. The filtered water is collected in a cup and tested.

Our latest testing revealed that the remarkable WD-FC-01 can effectively eliminate almost all chemical traces from water. Unfortunately, we discovered a faint residue that our test kit was sensitive enough to detect, leading to a slightly imperfect score.

The WD-FC-01 is one of only two models (the other being the [Wingsol WS-FM001](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-filters/reviews/wingsol/wingsol-ws-fm001-pac-faucet/)) in our extensive database that achieved this impressive level of performance.

### Flow Rate Test

Duration: 20 secs

Amount: 0.43 gallons

Flow Rate: 1.29 GPM

The Waterdrop WD-FC-01 is a close runner-up to its sibling, the WD-FC-06 when it comes to filtering flow rate.

Starting from a flow rate straight from the tap of 2.2 GPM, the WD-FC-01 achieved 1.29 GPM in filtration mode, only narrowly missing the mark set by the WD-FC-06 at 1.3 GPM.

The difference between these two models’ filtering flow rates is small enough that you won't notice a difference between them in everyday usage.

Overall, the filtering flow rate of the WD-FC-01 is impressive. If you have a high flow rate faucet in your home (around 2.0 to 2.2 GPM), this filter will complement it well.

Design
------

design Scores: **9.1**

*   Build Quality (40%) - **8.3**/10
    
*   Filter Piece (50%) - **10**/10
    
*   Routing Valve (10%) - **8.2**/10
    

The Waterdrop WD-FC-01 is built mostly from plastic. Although the unit feels solid and high-quality, the plastic construction doesn’t bode well for the filter’s long-term durability.

Waterdrop did a good job at designing the unit’s various components, from the removable filter piece to the marked routing valve and handle.

### In the Box

*   Paperwork (manuals)
*   A packet of plumbing tape
*   Two spare rubber gaskets

### Dimensions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/waterdrop-wd-fc-01-faucet-water-filter-dimensions-cldyadpw5003mde882man9qj1.jpg" alt="The dimensions of the Waterdrop WD-FC-01 are marked to the side, length (5 inches), width (2.2 inches), height (5.2 inches)." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 6.0" (15.2 cm)

Width: 2.5" (6.4 cm)

Height: 4.3" (10.9 cm)

Weight: 0.7 lbs (0.3 kg)

Despite the high performance, the Waterdrop WD-FC-01 is very compact, thanks to its modular design. When it’s not in use, or you want to put it into storage, you can twist the filter compartment and remove it from the main housing, effectively reducing the entire system to a palm-sized faucet head.

This special design sets it apart from all other systems on the market.

Even when fully assembled, we found that the filter wasn’t cumbersome and didn’t get in the way of normal usage of the faucet.

### 8.3 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/waterdrop-wd-fc-01-faucet-water-filter-build-quality-1-cldyafs95003nde88fg9qcd2e.jpg" alt="The disassembled parts of the Waterdrop WD-FC-01 faucet-mount water filter.

Out of all the faucet-mount filters we’ve tested, the Waterdrop-WD-FC-01 is definitely the model with the most unique design. It comes in the box as two separate pieces that can be attached together via a port to the side of the main circular piece.

Installation is not done by a traditional slip-on, rotating collar like other models. Instead, you have a peculiar plastic ring that can secure the filter to an adapter (included in the box).

Virtually all parts of the filter housing are built from plastic, which doesn’t bode well for its long-term durability. We project that the filter should last about a year or two before it needs to be replaced.

### 10 - Filter Piece

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/waterdrop-wd-fc-01-faucet-water-filter-filter-piece-cldvddhaa000mde8884aqazh9.jpg" alt="The filter piece of the Waterdrop WD-FC-01.

Filter Model: Waterdrop WD-FF-01A replacement filter

Filtration Process: Activated carbon with polyester membrane; mineral core

Certifications: NSF/ANSI 42

Filter Capacity: 320 gallons

The filter piece, according to Waterdrop, treats water using activated carbon made from “Sri Lankan coconuts.” Because of this, Waterdrop has advised that whenever a new filter is used, it’s important to flush it for at least 3 minutes. During our test, we did as instructed, and for the first few seconds, the filtered water stream was blackened by excess carbon that eventually cleared out.

Besides activated carbon, the filter also has a mineral core, which supposedly adds a fresher taste to the water by infusing it with beneficial minerals.

The exterior of the filter piece is made from a polyester membrane, which helps with general filtration by straining out debris.

### 8.2 - Routing Valve

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/waterdrop-wd-fc-01-faucet-water-filter-routing-valve-cldvdej0h000nde8839jpdps4.jpg" alt="The silver handle of the routing valve. Printed on the handle are “Pure” and “Tap” with arrows, denoting turning directions." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/waterdrop-wd-fc-01-faucet-water-filter-installation-cldvdmzbr000qde880tmg8dyq.jpg" alt="The silver plastic twist ring at the top of the WD-FC-01 filter." width="300px" height="200px">

Type of Valve: Rotating

The handle for the routing valve is made from chrome-plated plastic. The material is pretty thin, so its longevity is questionable at best. But other than this small hiccup, Waterdrop did a very good job designing the routing valve.

On the outside of the handle are clear markings on which way to rotate if you want pure or tap water (downward for plain tap water, level for purified water).

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **10.0**

*   Installation (25%) - **10**/10
    
*   Ease of Use (30%) - **10**/10
    
*   Leak (35%) - **10**/10
    
*   Maintenance (10%) - **10**/10
    

The filter’s usability isn’t as high as we had hoped. It’s mostly hampered by a lower score in the installation section than most due to having a unique installation system. Instead of a rotating collar like most models, the WD-FC-01 has a removable plastic ring that fastens to a faucet adapter. We had to read the manual (a first!) to know how to put it on correctly.

Besides the problematic installation, the WD-FC-01 is straightforward to use and maintain.

### 10 - Installation

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/waterdrop-wd-fc-01-faucet-water-filter-installation-cldvdhz5l000ode884szh6o53.jpg" alt="The Waterdrop WD-FC-01 with a yellow faucet adapter attached to its mounting port through the silver plastic twist ring." width="300px" height="200px">

Installation is probably the most problematic part of this filter. Unlike other faucet-mount water filters we’ve tested, the Waterdrop WD-FC-01 doesn’t use a rotating collar to anchor itself onto the tap. Rather, it uses a removable circular plastic ring at the top of the main housing to secure it to an adapter (which must be installed separately onto the faucet beforehand).

While we appreciate the unique design, it can be a bit confusing for many people to figure out how to get the filter onto the tap. It’s the only filter in our database that we had to read the user manual to figure out how to install properly.

### 10 - Ease of Use

If you’ve ever used a faucet-mount filter before, you’ll have no problem using the Waterdrop WD-FC-01. Pull the handle until it’s level to get purified water, and pull it down to switch back to plain tap water.

Once it’s been properly installed on the faucet, the filter is solidly anchored to the faucet’s head without wiggling.

### 10 - Leak

The filter doesn’t leak at any point during our test. Even during the transition phase between filtered and plain water, there’s no leaking from either nozzles or seams on the filter housing.

### 10 - Maintenance

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/waterdrop-wd-fc-01-faucet-water-filter-maintenance-cldvdj8na000pde88fcem80yq.jpg" alt="The Waterdrop WD-FC-01’s filter in the center, with the housing and pieces of the filter compartment surrounding it." width="300px" height="200px">

The filter will last roughly 3 months under normal usage.

Filter Indicator: No

Replacement: 3 months

According to Waterdrop, the 320-gallon filter should last for around 3 months under normal use. Since it doesn’t come with a filter change indicator, you’ll have to keep track of the filter’s lifespan yourself and change it out when the time comes.

As of February 2023, this model's replacement filter ([WD-FF-03A](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087CNVWS4?&linkCode=ll1&tag=lunagfwf5-20&linkId=cfb5ea494e559b265a97f06a1b919588&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)) is still available.
