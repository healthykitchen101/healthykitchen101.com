The Waterdrop Chubby filter pitcher impressed with its outstanding performance of reducing chlorine by over 90% at an excellent flow rate. It delivered crisp and pleasant-tasting water while preserving mineral content. The design strikes a fine balance between aesthetics and functionality, with meticulous craftsmanship evident in each part. Furthermore, easy assembly and disassembly add to the overall positive experience.

The Waterdrop Chubby is a compelling choice if you want a high-performing, aesthetic, and easy-to-use water filtration solution. In our test appraisal it received our best Performance and Overall scores. That, and the surprisingly low price of under $30, made it our [best water filter pitcher](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-filters/reviews/best/water-filter-pitchers/) for the home above all others.

**Things We Like**

*   Excellent flow rate

Waterdrop filter pitchers are known for their sleek designs, and the Chubby is no exception. Its ergonomic body and the subtleness in every detail give it that classy, sophisticated look that stands among the dozens of other water filter pitchers. But, is there more to it than meets the eye? Find out what our hands-on testing revealed.

The Waterdrop Chubby was the second-best performer among all the filter pitchers we’ve tested thus far (0.2 points behind [the Aquagear,](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-filters/reviews/aquagear/aquagear-water-filter-pitcher-10-cup/) which ended up with lower Design and Usability scores). It reduced chlorine by more than 90% in our extremely high chlorinated test water—and did so at an unmatched speed. Its NSF 42 certified double filter produced crisp, sweet tasting water without stripping off total dissolved solids (TDS) which may contain beneficial minerals.

### Chlorine

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/waterdrop-chubby-water-filter-pitcher-chlorine-clkbz0uo5000te788c0k8ew56.jpg" alt="Test tube containing water labeled Waterdrop next to water test kit box with two test strips on top" width="300px" height="200px">

Before: 10 mg/l

After: 0.5-1 mg/l

The Waterdrop Chubby surpassed many others in our chlorine removal test. The double filter reduced the 10+ mg/l concentration of chlorine to below 1 mg/l. 

Note that at 10 mg/l, our test water contains at least [2.5 times](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/public/water_disinfection.html#:~:text=What%20are%20safe%20levels%20of,effects%20are%20unlikely%20to%20occur.) more chlorine than the CDC’s recommended level of 4 mg/l or below. If you’re filtering normal tap water, it’s highly likely that the filter will reach its advertised maximum residual chlorine reduction rate of 97.4%.

### Flow Rate

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/waterdrop-chubby-water-filter-pitcher-flow-rate-clkbz1u34000ue788h4z26hnm.jpg" alt="Waterdrop water filter pitcher next to a phone with timer" width="300px" height="200px">

Duration: 2 minutes 39 seconds

Amount: 1600 ml

Flow Rate: 10.1 ml/s

Those who hate having to refill their filter pitchers in advance will appreciate the Chubby’s fast flow rate. It takes less than 3 minutes to process a full reservoir—that’s 22 seconds to produce a standard glass of water! Among a dozen or so filter pitchers we’ve tested, none matched this performance. Its double filter with two dispensing holes clearly takes the speed to the next level.

This mid-size pitcher is ideal for singles and families who need filtered water for both drinking and cooking. Even if you forget to refill, the wait will be minimal.

### Taste & Smell

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/waterdrop-chubby-water-filter-pitcher-taste-smell-clkbz2wo7000ve788fqnohyz0.jpg" alt="Gloved hand holding TDS meter over a paper cup labeled Brita Aluna and the lower part of a water filter pitcher" width="300px" height="200px">

Unfiltered TDS: 70 ppm

Filtered TDS: 53 ppm

While stripping away most of the chlorine, the Waterdrop filter kept the TDS at an acceptable level. Because the water retains its TDS or mineral content, it has a sweeter, more natural taste than water filtered by a reverse osmosis system—which tends to be more acidic or sour.

The Waterdrop Chubby perfectly blends aesthetics with top-notch functionality. Each part embraces a modest and refined design. Likewise, the craftsmanship has a superb fit and finish so it looks delightful on a countertop. The PF-01A duo-filter is highly effective, well-built, and easy to work with.

The Chubby filter pitcher arrived with a lot of dirt inside. Since our lab is in Ho Chi Minh City, a replacement from the US was not so practical. Luckily, however, a little water and mild soap did the job. The filter was wrapped separately and in mint condition. If you see any faults or hints of tampering, it might be better to ask for a replacement.

### 9.0 - Build Quality

The Chubby is well-built with a minimalist touch. It’s a rare product where style doesn’t come at a cost to durability or functionality. Additionally, the wooden handle gives a unique and elegant appeal. Its surprising sturdiness also questioned the necessity of a typical all-plastic design and the filter fit felt very robust. Considering the price at just over $20, it certainly looks a lot more expensive.

### 9.0 - Conveniences

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/waterdrop-chubby-water-filter-pitcher-conveniences-clkbz9hzb000ye78879c17oa6.jpg" alt="Waterdrop pitcher, viewed from top" width="300px" height="200px">

Spigot: No

Replacement Indicator: Yes

Measuring 5.4 inches in width, the Waterdrop Chubby didn’t fit in our 290 L fridge door (5 inches across), but it left ample space on the shelves. The pitcher does not have a spigot nor does it need one for its medium size and weight. 

We like that the refill trap door is transparent, so you can clearly see when the reservoir is full. Even so, the trap door conveniently closes as the volume reaches capacity. It actually has a metal spring at one end, which we suspect may be prone to rusting after a few years. After a few months of use, our pitcher still looked and worked like new.

The filter replacement light is neatly built into the lid and needs only a quick press to display the filter life status. It shows a blue hue for a new and usable filter, bright red for a replacement needed soon, and dark red for an immediate replacement. The two shades of red can be confusing for new users, so make sure you refer to the manual the first time you see a red dot on the pitcher lid.

### 9.0 - Filter

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/waterdrop-chubby-water-filter-pitcher-filter-clkbzawch000ze7886k62h9yb.jpg" alt="Filter of Waterdrop pitcher" width="300px" height="200px">

Filter Model: WD-PF-01A

Filtration Process: activated carbon fiber

Certifications: NSF 42, NSF 372

Filter Capacity: 200 gal

Like all other Waterdrop filter pitchers, the Chubby uses the PF-01A, which is a double filter with multiple input holes and two dispensing openings—hence the superfast filtration speed. The filter appeared well made, with everything neatly in place and no signs of material leakage. Installation involves placing it into the reservoir and gently pushing down. It couldn’t be easier.

The Waterdrop Chubby is easy to assemble and disassemble, with secure yet easy-to-remove parts. Its rounded corners add to the safety and sleek appearance. The pitcher features a trap door for convenient refilling and a firm, grippy wood handle. Handwashing takes only a few minutes to maintain its cleanliness.

### 9.5 - Assembling

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/waterdrop-chubby-water-filter-pitcher-assembling-clkbzd5od0010e78806a58b3c.jpg" alt="Parts of Waterdrop Chubby water filter pitcher, viewed from top" width="300px" height="200px">

With only a few basic pieces with clear indications of their positions, the Waterdrop Chubby pitcher is easy to put together and take apart. The parts fit securely and do not require excessive effort to remove. All parts are rounded at the corners, which not only softens and smoothens the look but also makes them safer to work with.

### 8.2 - Refilling

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/waterdrop-chubby-water-filter-pitcher-refilling-clknmfib000094a88hjw5bzx4.jpg" alt="Gloved hand pushing open filling door on Waterdrop lid" width="300px" height="200px">

Reservoir Capacity: 1600 ml

The Chubby features a sensitive spring-loaded trap door for single-handed, hassle-free refilling. This flap is clear and closes up as the water level rises in the reservoir, allowing you to stop before it overflows. You will need two refills to reach maximum capacity, but the wait is minimal due to the fast flow rate.

### 9.0 - Dispensing

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/waterdrop-chubby-water-filter-pitcher-dispensing-clkbzu5mv0011e78852ky2z1j.jpg" alt="Gloved hand lifting spout cover of Waterdrop Chubby filter pitcher" width="300px" height="200px">

The Warterdrop Chubby has a small spout with a cover to keep out dust or insects. Its modest size and the pointed tip minimize splashing or overflow during pouring. The fast flow rate means you can have filtered water within minutes, plus the secure lid makes it safe to pour while the reservoir is still a third full.

We like that the handle is made of wood, which not only looks stylish but is also very grippy and warm to the touch. It can hold and support the weight of a full pitcher despite having just one joint.

### 9.0 - Cleaning

Dishwasher Safe: No

Though it cannot be tossed into a dishwasher, the Chubby takes only a few minutes to wash manually. Drying the wood handle with a towel immediately after washing may be useful to prevent bacteria, mold, or discoloration.
