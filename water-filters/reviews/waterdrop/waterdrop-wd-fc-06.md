Claiming the title as the best-performing faucet-mount water filter in our database (as of January 2023), the Waterdrop-WD-FC-6 is easily our top recommendation.

Besides having a perfect score in our chlorine filtering test, the WD-FC-06 also has the fastest filtering flow rate (1.3 GPM from a high-pressure faucet that flows at 2.2 GPM).

**Things We Like**

*   Excellent filtering flow rate (1.3 GPM).
*   Near-perfect chlorine filtration efficiency.
*   Great build quality using 304 food-grade stainless steel.
*   The routing valve is solid and easy to use.

**Things We Don’t Like**

Our first impression of the Waterdrop-WD-FC-06 was one of amazement. Out of the dozen filters we’ve tested at Healthy Kitchen 101, it’s the model with the best-looking packaging. The filter, made from stainless steel, is packed in foam. When taken out of the box, it has a nice weight to it.

Our tests revealed the Waterdrop-WD-FC-06 has one of the highest total scores. It’s an easy pick for our list of the [best water faucet filters](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-filters/reviews/best/faucet-water-filters/) in 2023. The unit eliminated nearly 100% chlorine while maintaining an impressive filtration flow rate.

If you’re looking for a [mid-range water filter](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-filters/reviews/best/) that combines performance and aesthetics well, the Waterdrop-WD-FC-06 will do nicely!

Performance
-----------

performance Scores: **9.4**

*   Chlorine Test (40%) - **10**/10
    
*   Flow Rate Test (60%) - **9.0**/10
    

The Waterdrop-WD-FC-06 has proven itself with a near-perfect score in the current performance testing methodology.

In the chlorine filtration test, the unit could scrub out all traces of chlorine in the bucket of highly-chlorinated water we used as a test sample. The Waterdrop-WD-FC-06 also performed excellently in our flow rate test with a filtration flow rate of 1.3 GPM (a reduction of just 0.2 GPM from our normal tap flow rate of 2.2 GPM).

### Chlorine Test

To its left is the testing result pad with two activated test strips." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/waterdrop-wd-fc-06-faucet-water-filter-chlorine-thumbnail-cldyb3bar003ude88ctyk0ouf.jpg" alt="Waterdrop WD-FC-06 Faucet Filter Chlorine Test 2" width="300px" height="200px">

Before: 10+ mg/l

After: ~0 mg/l

The Waterdrop WD-FC-06 has shown outstanding performance in chlorine filtration. When tested against our test media, which had a total chlorine value of over 10+ mg/l, the unit effectively removed virtually all of the chlorine. The filtered sample tested at near 0 mg/l, indicating a near-perfect chlorine filtration efficiency.

### Flow Rate Test

Duration: 20 secs

Amount: 0.446 gallons

Flow Rate: 1.3 GPM

The Waterdrop-WD-FC-06 has the fastest filtering flow rate in our database. Without the filter and the tap fully opened, we measured our tap’s flow rate to be 2.2 GPM. Once the filter was installed and switched to filtering mode, we calculated a drop of 0.9 GPM (from 2.2 GPM down to 1.3 GPM).

Even if you’re used to using high-flow rate faucets (around 2.2 GPM or so), the WD-FC-06 will be a perfect fit.

Interestingly, in terms of flow rate, the WD-FC-06 is only _slightly_ faster than its cheaper sibling, the [Waterdrop WD-FC-01](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-filters/reviews/waterdrop/waterdrop-wd-fc-01/), which still got a very good flow rate at 1.29 GPM.

Design
------

design Scores: **9.1**

*   Build Quality (40%) - **8.3**/10
    
*   Filter Piece (50%) - **10**/10
    
*   Routing Valve (10%) - **8.2**/10
    

Waterdrop did a great job at giving this water filter an expensive, luxurious look with an outer shell made from glossy metal. The filter is assessed to be impeccably built. None of the components—from the routing valve to the mounting collar—have any visible design or manufacturing flaws.

The filter piece comes separated from the filter, but installation is easy and quick.

### In the Box

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/waterdrop-wd-fc-06-faucet-filter-box-cldvh3vct001ede88hsq2ec5t.jpg" alt="The content of the shipping box of the Waterdrop WD-FC-06 water filter, including adapters, filter blocks, and manuals." width="300px" height="200px">

The filter comes in a black box padded generously with foam to protect the components during transportation. Inside the box, the filter housing is positioned neatly to the right in its own compartment, and the separate filter block to the left.

Above all of the components with their own cut-outs in the foam are four color-coded faucet adapters.

All in all, in the box, you get:

*   The filter housing
*   The filter block
*   Four color-coded adapters
*   A packet of plumbing tape
*   Manuals and warranty card

### Dimensions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/waterdrop-wd-fc-06-faucet-filter-dimensions-cldyb77nu003xde88eom6774q.jpg" alt="The dimensions of the Waterdrop WD-FC-06. Marked to the side is length (5 inches), width (2.5 inches), and height (5 inches)." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 5.0" (12.7 cm)

Width: 2.5" (6.4 cm)

Height: 5.0" (12.7 cm)

Weight: 1.2 lbs (0.5 kg)

With the filter block installed, the Waterdrop-WD-FC-06 weighs around 1.2 pounds. It gives the filter a solid weight in the hand, but it’s not so heavy that it’s at risk of bending or breaking the faucet when mounted.

The faucet is compact enough that it won’t get in the way when you use the tap for hand or dishwashing.

### 8.3 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/waterdrop-wd-fc-06-faucet-filter-build-quality-cldvh5imm001fde88f6xzdy4s.jpg" alt="The silvery, metallic Waterdrop WD-FC-06 faucet-mount water filter on a grey table." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/waterdrop-wd-fc-06-faucet-filter-build-quality-1-cldvh63le001gde889g7q64b7.jpg" alt="The Waterdrop WD-FC-06 on its side, with its two dispensing nozzles exposed." width="300px" height="200px">

As we said earlier, Waterdrop did a very good job at making the WD-FC-06. Every aspect, from the exterior design to the material used for constructing the filter, indicates that this is a premium model.

[304 food-grade stainless steel](https://www.dm-consultancy.com/TR/dosya/1-59/h/aisi-340-info.pdf) is used to build every part of the filter, including all of its components, such as the swivel collar to the routing valve. So, not only does the filter have a sleek look, but it should also last for a long time before needing to be replaced.

### 10 - Filter Piece

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/waterdrop-wd-fc-06-faucet-filter-filter-piece-cldvh7omn001hde8856k9d49i.jpg" alt="The Waterdrop WD-FC-06 filter piece on a table. The outer membrane of the filter is soaked after being flushed." width="300px" height="200px">

Filter Model: Waterdrop WD-FF-01A replacement filter

Filtration Process: Activated Carbon

Certifications: NSF/ANSI 42

Filter Capacity: 320 gallons

Out of the box, the filter is separated from the housing and has to be manually installed. Waterdrop has claimed that the filter uses [activated carbon](https://www.health.state.mn.us/communities/environment/hazardous/topics/gac.html#:~:text=A%20filter%20with%20granular%20activated,rotten%20eggs%20odor)%20or%20chlorine.) “made from [Sri Lankan coconut shells](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343017092_Production_of_activated_carbon_from_coconut_shells)” to remove harmful chemicals in the water.

Since there’s carbon (charcoal) in the filter, Waterdrop has recommended flushing the filter for 3 minutes before using it. And indeed, the first time we turned the filter on, the water coming out of the filter was blackened by charcoal.

### 8.2 - Routing Valve

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/waterdrop-wd-fc-06-faucet-filter-routing-valve-cldvh8zun001ide88e2jd4379.jpg" alt="The silvery, chrome-plated rotating handle of the routing valve on the side of the Waterdrop WD-FC-06 faucet-mount filter." width="300px" height="200px">

Type of Valve: Rotating

The routing valve of the Waterdrop-WD-FC-06 can be operated via a rotating handle to the side of the main nozzle.

In the horizontal position, the filter is in filtering mode. Tap water will be diverted through the filter block, giving you clean water from the larger nozzle to the side.

You can turn the handle to the vertical position when you don’t need filtered water (such as for hand or dishwashing). This will allow plain tap water to flow through the filter without passing by the filter block. This can extend the service life of the filter.

The turning motion of our review unit is smooth and feels very solid. However, its long-term durability is questionable as the rotating handle is plastic.

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **10.0**

*   Installation (25%) - **10**/10
    
*   Ease of Use (30%) - **10**/10
    
*   Leak (35%) - **10**/10
    
*   Maintenance (10%) - **10**/10
    

Overall, the Waterdrop WD-FC-06 is easy to install and even easier to use. Once mounted on the faucet, you only need to switch the routing valve’s handle back and forth to switch between filtered or plain water.

During both the installation and testing phases, the WD-FC-06 did not leak.

Maintenance is simple, thanks to the straightforward filter change process. Replacement filters are also widely available online. The only downside is that the filter doesn’t have a filter change indicator.

### 10 - Installation

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/ms-20230206-122-cldvhbtwy001jde88fnbr78om.jpg" alt="A close-up shot of the Waterdrop WD-FC-06’s mounting port. It currently has a metallic faucet attached to it." width="300px" height="200px">

Our testing rig uses a faucet with external threading, so installation is as simple as slipping the rotating collar onto the tap and tightening. If your faucet has internal threading and can’t be mounted directly, you can use the adapters included in the box.

### 10 - Ease of Use

Aside from being easy to install, the Waterdrop-WD-FC-06 is a joy to use. Its lightweight and solid locking collar means it doesn’t wiggle once properly installed. The routing valve is snappy and does not leak when transitioning between bypass and filtering modes.

Plus, for being the water filter with the highest filtering flow rate in our database so far, this model is a great candidate for anyone who needs a performant faucet-mount filter.

### 10 - Leak

Across all tests, the Waterdrop-WD-FC-6 doesn’t leak either from the locking collar or any of the nozzles.

### 10 - Maintenance

Filter Indicator: N/A

Replacement: 3 months

After 320 gallons, the filter of the Waterdrop-WD-FC-06 has to be replaced. According to Waterdrop, the filter should last you around 3 months. Unfortunately, the unit doesn’t come with a filter change indicator, so you’ll have to track the replacement time yourself.

As of January 2023, the [replacement filter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08D8V3YNV?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=lunagfwf4-20&linkId=5dab48428a6e0a16ced332459ada795e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) is still available online.
