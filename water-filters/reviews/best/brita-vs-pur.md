Brita and PUR are the two names that immediately come to mind wherever home water filtering is concerned. 

Both companies are veterans in the business with decades of experience. In all of that time, they have both built reputations as dependable, quality suppliers of household filtering systems. But considering their apparent parity, it can be hard to choose a company to stick with.

In this **Brita vs. PUR** water filtering guide, we want to lay that debate to rest once and for all.

Why You Should Get a Home Water Filtration System
-------------------------------------------------

Tap water, while treated at local plants, isn't perfectly clean due to its journey through miles of pipelines. These pipes can harbor microorganisms such as E.coli, Giardia, and Noroviruses, which may end up in household water supplies, per [the EPA](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-10/documents/ace3_drinking_water.pdf).

Beyond microorganisms, tap water may also contain harmful inorganic compounds like lead and arsenic, various hazardous organic compounds (such as glyphosate and atrazine), and disinfectants like chlorine and chloroform. High concentrations of these chemicals can lead to gastrointestinal illnesses, and substances like arsenic can increase cancer risks when consumed untreated.

Additionally, many people choose to use home water filtration systems not just for health reasons but because they dislike the taste and smell of tap water. It can have a chemical taste due to chlorine added at the water treatment plant.

Brita vs. PUR: Water Faucet Filters & Pitcher Filters
-----------------------------------------------------

Brita and PUR both sell two distinct types of water filters: **water faucet filters** and **pitcher filters**.

**Water faucet filters** are mounted directly onto the kitchen faucet or other water outlets around the house in order to provide convenient drinkable water. 

#### Advantages

When unfiltered tap water passes through the filtering unit, the filter media inside removes contaminants like dissolved minerals, harmful debris, toxic chemicals, and germs. But the filter doesn’t just make water safer for consumption — it can eliminate strange tastes or odors as well.

Thus, faucet filters are great options for people who are focused on convenience. They will also be good investments for people who dislike the off-taste of chlorinated or mineral-laden water that comes directly from the treatment plant.

#### Disadvantages

Water faucet filters still come with a number of setbacks.

1.  **Higher Maintenance Costs**: Faucet filters typically have a shorter lifespan than pitcher filters. For instance, while the Brita Longlast pitcher filter can last over six months, the Brita Faucet Mount filter only lasts about four months. This can lead to annual maintenance costs ranging from $70 to $100.
2.  **Less Efficient Filtration**: The compact size of faucet filters means the water has less contact time with the filter media, reducing filtration efficiency compared to larger units like pitcher filters.
3.  **Dependency on Water Pressure**: Faucet filters often use single-stage activated carbon filters that require high water pressure to function effectively. Low water pressure can prevent water from passing through the filter, disrupting the flow.
4.  **Variable Performance**: The effectiveness of faucet filters can vary significantly between models. While some can remove a wide range of contaminants including dissolved minerals and germs, others may only improve taste and odor.

### Pitcher Filters

**Pitcher filters** are fitted atop water containers instead of mounted on the kitchen tap. When unfiltered water is poured into the inlet, the core filter takes out all of the contaminants present and clean water is ultimately released into the primary reservoir. The filtering process can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes depending on how much water you pour into the pitcher.

The filter technology most often used in pitcher filters is [Granular Activated Carbon (GAC)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333405623_Granular_Activated_Carbon_Design_Operation_and_Cost). Small grains of activated carbon trap large debris and prevent them from flowing through the filter. At the same time, the activated carbon will absorb any contaminants like chlorine, mercury, and lead that come into contact with it.

#### Advantages

Pitcher filters offer several advantages over tap-mounted units:

1.  **Enhanced Filtering Efficiency**: Due to their larger and more robust filter media, pitcher filters allow for longer contact time with the water. This longer "steep time" enables them to trap more contaminants and more effectively remove bad flavors and odors.
2.  **No Need for High Water Pressure**: Gravity-fed pitcher filters don't rely on high water pressure. Simply pouring water into the top is sufficient to start filtration.
3.  **Ease of Use**: Pitcher filters require no installation. You just insert the filter cartridge into its compartment inside the pitcher, and it's ready for immediate use.
4.  **Cost-Effectiveness**: Typically used only for drinking water, pitcher filters tend to wear out less quickly than faucet-mounted units, which are used for various tasks. This leads to less frequent maintenance and replacements, making them more economical in the long run.

#### Disadvantages

Pitcher filters, while effective, do have limitations:

1.  **Limited Capacity**: Most pitcher filters can hold and purify about 8 to 10 cups of water at a time. Once used up, you’ll have to add more water and wait 15 minutes to get a new batch.
2.  **Filter Lifespan**: Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) filters in pitchers can degrade in efficiency over time. As such, a pitcher filter needs to be replaced every three months to ensure effective operation and maintain water quality.

All You Need to Know About Brita Filters 
-----------------------------------------

Brita’s portfolio currently has two universal filters: the Brita Standard and Brita Longlast. Any Brita-branded pitchers and dispensers can accept either of these filters.

By design, the Standard and the Longlast are similarly constructed: both use Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) tech and ion-exchange resin beads. However, their filtering performance and longevity will differ.

A third filter model is the Brita Stream, which is only compatible with products in the Stream line-up. It consists of a single-stage activated carbon filter that’s usually found in faucet filters. As such, you will need high pressure to get any fresh water through this filter.

One thing of note is that the Brita Stream filter is not designed for intense filtering. It will only be able to eliminate basic chemicals like chlorine, some particulates, and debris.

The fourth and final major type of Brita filter is the Faucet Mount filter. Using a single-stage activated carbon filter, it offers surprisingly good performance for the price.

All of Brita’s filters are tested and certified by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Water Quality Association (WQA).

How Long Do Brita Filters Last?
-------------------------------

In terms of longevity, Brita outperforms PUR and other competitors. The Brita Longlast filter lasts approximately six months or 120 gallons, with a replacement cost of around $17.

The Brita Faucet Mount filter, another premium option, lasts about four months and costs $19 to replace. Despite being pricier and having a shorter lifespan, some users value its convenience and superior filtering capabilities.

Brita's entry-level products, like the Brita Standard and Brita Stream, are more affordable at $7 each. However, they only last two to three months or about 40 gallons before needing replacement.

Brita has offered many faucet-mount filters over the years, but as the most popular one by far, we’ve put the Brita Basic to the test in our lab. The filter lived up to its claim of being able to take out chlorine in the water.

While it wasn’t as well-built as we had hoped, the filter still passed all our tests by a good enough margin that we can still recommend it if you’re looking for something PUR-branded.

All You Need to Know About PUR Filters
--------------------------------------

PUR offers three main types of filters:

*   PUR Basic Filter: Available for both pitcher and faucet-mounted systems.
*   PUR Lead Reducing Filter: Designed specifically for pitchers and optimized to tackle lead contamination more efficiently.
*   PUR MineralClear Filter: Exclusive for faucets and is equipped to handle water with a high concentration of dissolved minerals, also known as hard water.

All PUR filters utilize the company's patented Maxion Filter Technology, which combines granular activated carbon (GAC) and ion-exchange resin beads. This innovative combination is designed to enhance the removal of various contaminants. In fact, all PUR filters are certified by the Water Quality Association (WQA) to effectively reduce common chemicals like chlorine, mercury, and pesticides.

### What Does PUR Filter Out?

Here’s a short table of all the notable chemicals that each PUR filter model can handle.

| Chemicals | PUR Basic | PUR Lead Reducing | PUR MineralClear |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chlorine | x | x | x |
| Lead |  | x | x |
| Mercury | x | x | x |
| Cadmium | x | x | x |
| Benzene |  | x | x |
| Asbestos |  |  |  |
| Class I Particulates | x | x | x |
| Class IV Particulates | x | x | x |
| Copper | x | x | x |
| Zinc | x | x | x |
| 1, 2, 4 - Trichlorobenzene |  |  |  |
| Trichloroethylene (TCE) | x | x | x |
| Atrazine | x | x | x |

PUR excels over Brita in filtration capabilities, with even the most affordable PUR Basic filter removing most major chemicals except lead. If you’re concerned about lead in your water supply, the PUR Lead Reducing or MineralClear filters will be great options.

All in all, choosing a PUR filter is a fairly straightforward affair. You’ll mostly only have to think about whether lead reduction is a critical need.

### How Long Do PUR Filters Last?

PUR filters offer superior filtration but have a shorter lifespan compared to Brita filters.

The PUR Basic and Lead Reducing Filters last about 40 gallons or 2 months, similar to Brita’s entry-level filters. Meanwhile, the more premium PUR MineralClear filter lasts up to 100 gallons or about 3 months. The replacement costs for PUR filters are about equal to Brita's, too, with PUR Basic filters priced around $11-$12 each, Lead Reducing Filters at about $25 for a three-pack, and a two-pack of MineralClear Filters costing around $20.

Even though maintenance can cost you a bit more, the better filtration capability of PUR filters makes them a great investment if filtration quality is your top priority.

### PUR Water Filter Systems

#### Water Filtering Pitchers

Much like Brita, PUR has introduced numerous water-filtering pitcher models over the years. So far, we’ve only had the opportunity to test one model, which is the PUR Plus 30-cup dispenser.

1\. Best PUR Dispenser: PUR Plus 30-cup dispenser

*   Strong build, durable material
*   Effective against chlorine
*   Straightforward filter life indicator
*   Handy spigot

*   Slow flow rate
*   Basic, unattractive design

This model excels at removing chemicals like chlorine from your water, but its basic, blocky design and sluggish flow rate may not appeal to everyone. With more visually appealing and efficient models available on the market, the PUR Plus 30-cup dispenser could face stiff competition, making it a tougher sell for some consumers.

#### Faucet-Mounted Filters

Two PUR faucet-mounts were tested by us, the PUR PLUS PFM350V and the PUR FM2500V. While both have their respective pros and cons (and fortunately, none of them failed any part of our quality checks), the PUR FM2500V stood out best for making it to our top listing.

2\. Best PUR Faucet Filter: PUR FM2500V Faucet Water Filter

*   Excellent chlorine filtering ability
*   Easy installation and servicing with "one-click" system
*   Lightweight and compact design
*   A filter change indicator

*   Low flow rate in filtering mode
*   Weak grip on faucet due to the one-click system
*   Flimsy routing valve’s handle
*   The plastic construction can be problematic for long-term durability

The PUR FM2500V was a stand-out in our test — so much so that it got into our list of the best faucet-mount water filters. Performance-wise, the filter expectedly shone in chlorine removal. Its Mineral Core cartridge managed to reduce chlorine from high levels of over 10 mg/l to nearly 0 mg/l. Disappointingly, its flow rate was rather slow at just 0.44 gallons per minute. Despite the slow flow rate and durability concerns, the FM2500V's effective chlorine removal and mineral replenishment isn’t a bad option for those seeking a capable faucet-mount water filter.

Round-Up: Which One Should You Choose?
--------------------------------------

### Why Choose Brita?

Brita has affordability and longevity on its side. All of its water filtering systems (pitchers and faucets) are cheaper than their PUR counterparts. Replacement filters are also cheaper than PUR’s spare filters.

Another advantage that Brita has is that, compared to PUR, their products are more widespread. You can find them in any brick-and-mortar hardware outlet and it takes just a few keystrokes online to find their products, too.

So although it may not have as great filtering performance as PUR. If you’re shopping on a budget and want a purchase that lasts for a long time, Brita would be the better of the two to go with.

### Why Choose PUR?

PUR’s specialty is filtering performance. Even its basic filter (the aptly-named PUR Basic) can filter out far more contaminants and particulates than Brita’s top-of-the-line filters. For this reason, if you need a serious water-filtering system, PUR should be considered the better one.

Higher performance comes at a literal cost, though. PUR filtering systems are costlier and replacement filters are also more expensive. It doesn’t help that, as previously mentioned, PUR filters don’t last nearly as long as Brita filters.

You should also keep in mind that PUR replacement filters and systems are notoriously difficult to find. You may need to do some online digging to get the exact model or replacement parts that you need.

The long and short of it, though, is if performance is more important to you than anything else and you are willing to spend the time and money to get it, choose PUR.

Conclusion
----------

We hope this **Brita vs. PUR** comparison has answered some of your burning questions regarding these brands. Both are reputable manufacturers that craft some of the best filtering systems on the market. But they each have special characteristics that will likely make one brand better for you than the other. 

Keep these quirks in mind and you can make an informed decision on what system and what filter to choose for your household.
