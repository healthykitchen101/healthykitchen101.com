While the US water system is among the safest in the world, plain tap water is still disliked by many people due to taste and odor concerns from disinfectants like chlorine. Instead of buying bottled water or investing thousands in a whole-house water filtration system, try a faucet-mount water filter!

These compact filters attach to your faucet, giving you fresh and crisp water right out of the tap by removing any contaminant lurking within your pipe. Usually costing no more than $100, they’re a much more affordable option than whole-house systems and are more sustainable than buying cases of bottled water every few weeks. See our full report here.

How We Test
-----------

In the current iteration of the performance test, we evaluated each filter in two ways: chlorine filtering efficiency and filtering flow rate (i.e., how much filtered water it can output per minute.)

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/premise-chlorine-test-cldmt8phb0005pb88hiwigr4l.jpg" alt="Eight test sticks arranged in a row, displaying results corresponding to the water sample vials collected from eight filters." width="360" height="240">

In our **chlorine test**, to assess its filtering ability, we challenge the filter with highly chlorinated water containing **10 mg/l of chlorine**, significantly surpassing the US household water system limit, or Maximum Residual Disinfectant Level (MRDL), of [4 mg/l](https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/national-primary-drinking-water-regulations#:~:text=in%20Drinking%20Water-,Chloramines%20(as%20Cl2),Water%20additive%20used%20to%20control%20microbes,-Chlorine%20dioxide%20(as). We subsequently test the filtered water with a **specialized kit**, requiring the filter to entirely remove chlorine (get the level down to **0 mg/l**) to get a perfect score in this section.

In the filtering **flow rate test**, we measure how much filtered water the unit can produce in 20 seconds. We take measurements using a measuring cup, a timer, and a weighing scale.

While we look at the filter's **performance**, we also evaluate its **design** and **ease of use**. An ideal filter must have a strong, durable construction with no noticeable design or manufacturing flaws. It should also be easy to use and install.

How We Picked
-------------

We select our picks based on comprehensive testing results. Models that excel in our testing methodology have a greater chance of being featured on our list. Our methodology evaluates all aspects of the product, including performance, design, and distinctive features compared to other products in class to assist you in making an informed purchasing decision.

Our Top Picks
-------------

We recently received and tested a large batch of faucet-mount water filters in our lab. Here are the ones that showed the most promise.

1\. Best Overall: Waterdrop WD-FC-06

*   Excellent chlorine filtration efficiency.
*   High filtering flow rate.
*   Unique design and installation system.
*   Replacement filters are readily available.

*   While unique, the installation system is hard to figure out.

Waterdrop is a fairly new brand and already stacks up well next to established names like PUR or Brita. The company has done an excellent job designing the Waterdrop WD-FC-06, which isn’t just one of the best-looking filters in our database, but also the finest performer in all our tests.

\[544\] Waterdrop WD-FC-06 chlorine levels

In our tests, the WD-FC-06 demonstrated exceptional **chlorine filtering capabilities**. When pitched against chlorinated water with a concentration exceeding **10 mg/l**, it effectively removed nearly all traces of the chemical, leaving water with a **near-zero** chlorine reading.

To achieve this filtering performance, the WD-FC-06 uses activated carbon in its filter cartridge. With a maximum capacity of **320 gallons** of water before replacement, it’ll be able to last you for months before you have to switch it out for a replacement.

This filter also excelled in the flow rate test, achieving approximately **1.3 gallons per minute** (GPM) on a high-pressure 2.2 GPM-rated tap. This rapid filtration speed easily sets it apart from the rest of the competition, with most having much lower speed.

The WD-FC-06's stainless steel construction gives it a sleek and luxurious appearance, seamlessly blending into any kitchen decor. We have no complaints about the build quality, either. Every detail is well-crafted with no discernible flaws.

2\. Runner-up: Waterdrop WD-FC-01

*   Excellent filtering flow rate (1.29 GPM).
*   Great build quality using food-grade plastic.
*   The routing valve is solid and easy to use.
*   Built-in filter life indicator.

*   Unique but finicky installation system.
*   Plastic construction makes long-term durability a concern.
*   The battery for the indicator light can’t be changed.

Among the tap-mounted water filters we’ve assessed, the only one that measures up to the WD-FC-06’s level of performance is its sibling, the WD-FC-01. This model, made from plastic, is slightly cheaper than the stainless steel design of the WD-FC-06. However, it’s still nearly as capable.

\[546\] Waterdrop WD-FC-01 hlorine level

In our test, there’s still room for improvement in the Waterdrop WD-FC-01's performance. When it's pitched against highly-chlorinated water, the filter only managed to reduce the chlorine concentration to around **0.5 mg/l**. This doesn’t quite meet our expectations with this model, but fortunately, the concentration isn’t high enough for it to be a problem.

The WD-FC-01 excels in the flow rate test, however, making it the second-best performer in this category. After 20 seconds, the WD-FC-01 produced 1,631 milliliters (0.43 gallons) of clean water. This equates to about **1.29 gallons per minute (GPM)** in filtering mode.

With a sleek two-piece white plastic housing, the WD-FC-01 is quite a looker. You’ll have to do some assembly when you first unpacked the filter. The filter compartment and the mounting piece via a twist-lock joint. Then, you can anchor the filter to the faucet through a mounting port and secured with a retention ring. When it’s properly installed, the bulk of the filter is positioned vertically along the faucet, so it won’t get in the way when you use the filter.

Similar to the WD-FC-06, the WD-FC-01 has an activated carbon filter, which explains its high filtration rate against chlorine. The filter also contains a “Mineral Core” to improve taste. It should last for around three months of typical usage.

3\. Best for Ease of Installation: PUR FM2500V Faucet Water Filter

*   Excellent chlorine filtering ability
*   Easy installation and servicing with "one-click" system
*   Lightweight and compact design
*   Filter change indicator to help keep track of the filter’s health

*   Low flow rate in filtering mode
*   Weak grip on faucet due to the one-click system
*   Flimsy routing valve’s handle
*   The plastic construction can be problematic for long-term durability
*   The battery for the indicator light can’t be changed.

The PUR FM2500V's performance is a mixed bag. It shines in chlorine removal, achieving a perfect score by reducing high chlorine levels from over **10 mg/l to nearly 0 mg/l**. However, it falters in the flow rate test, managing just **0.44 gallons per minute** (GPM).

\[545\] The PUR FM2500V special filter indicator light

The FM2500V offers an easy "one-click" installation system, allowing you to attach the filter to the faucet via an adapter. Removing it is also simple with two latches. However, our reviewers are concerned about the filter's long-term durability, considering how the housing is built from lightweight plastic.

A special feature of the PUR FM2500V is the **indicator light**. It flashes when water flows through the filter and changes color to tell you when it's time for a replacement. The battery in the indicator lasts 2-3 years and can't be changed. After that, you'll either need to monitor filter life yourself or buy a new unit altogether.

Inside, the FM2500V uses PUR's "Mineral Core" filter cartridge, which uses a combination of activated carbon and ion exchange materials for filtering. The filter also replenishes the water with natural minerals, making it tastier.

Filter cartridges hold 100 gallons and should be replaced every 2-3 months.
