The Wingsol WS-FM001 [faucet filter](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-filters/reviews/best/faucet-water-filters/) is a decent filter with its fair share of pros and cons. Though we’re fairly satisfied with its general performance, the WS-FM001 definitely didn’t perform as well as other models we have tested on the market.

In the chlorine test, it’s one of only two models in our database with a chlorine filtering rate of less than 100% (10). But in return, its filtering mode flow rate is excellent and among the best.

A standout feature of the WS-FM001 is its metallic and modern design. It looks great in any kitchen and adds a touch of elegance to your kitchen. The installation process is easy and straightforward. You only need to tighten the swivel collar around your faucet to secure it (faucet adapters are provided if you have faucets with internal threading).

Overall, the Wingsol WS-FM001 faucet-mount water filter isn’t a bad filter. But for the price, there are models out there from brands like PUR and Brita that can treat your water a lot better.

**Things We Like**

*   Durable stainless steel construction
*   Easy installation with slip-on, rotating collar
*   The handle for the routing valve is easy to use
*   Comes with up to 9 faucet adapters to fit different types of faucets

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Filtering performance is lower than other models we tested
*   We found rusting within the inner components of the filter, despite it being made from stainless steel

The name “Wingsol” isn’t nearly as popular as other names in the [water filtering market](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-filters/reviews/best/) segment, like PUR, Brita, or Culligan. However, the company’s WS-FM001-PAC (the variant with the Powdered Activated Carbon cartridge) still received much attention from customers. For a filter with a stainless steel design, the WS-FM001 is very affordable. This feature has helped it stand out among other filters we’ve tested.

But does it really meet up to expectations?

After testing it in the lab and using it in our kitchen for a week, here's our full test report!

Performance
-----------

performance Scores: **NaN**

*   Chlorine Test (40%) - **9.5**/undefined
    
*   Flow Rate Test (60%) - **9.0**/undefined
    

Performance-wise, the filter’s performance isn’t as good as most other filters we’ve tested. In the chlorine test, while it could filter out most of the free chlorine in the water, the test strip we used still showed a trace amount in the water. Fortunately, the amount is small enough that it won’t negatively affect the taste and smell of the water.

The flow rate of the filter is good. At 0.9 GPM in filtering mode, the Wingsol WS-FM001 is the third fastest filter in our database, behind the Waterdrop WD-FC-06 and WD-FC-01.

### Chlorine Test

To the left is the color pad with activated test strips." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/wingsol-ws-fm001-faucet-water-filter-chlorine-thumbnail-clei1v3ky000o6s88bd852eqj.jpg" alt="Wingsol Faucet Water Filter Chlorine Test" width="300px" height="200px">

Before: 10+ mg/l

After: ~0.1 - 0.5 mg/l

Although the Wingsol WS-FM001 did a decent job at taking out excess chlorine in the water, according to our water test strip, there is still a small amount of chlorine left. This amount, which can vary anywhere between 0.1 and 0.5 mg/l, is still within acceptable limits and won’t negatively affect the taste and odor of the water.

However, this is still not a good result. In our database, nearly all of the models we tested were able to remove nearly all traces of chlorine.

### Flow Rate Test

Duration: 20 secs

Amount: 0.3 gallons

Flow Rate: 0.9 GPM

In our database, the Wingsol WS-FM001 is the filter with the third fastest filtration speed, just behind the [Waterdrop WD-FC-06](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-filters/reviews/waterdrop/waterdrop-wd-fc-06/) and the [Waterdrop WD-FC-01](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-filters/reviews/waterdrop/waterdrop-wd-fc-01/).

We attached it to our high-pressure faucet with a measured flow rate of 2.2 GPM. After turning on the tap and switching the filter to filtering mode, we measured a flow rate of 0.9 GPM with the Wingsol WS-FM001.

While the flow reduction is significant, it will still be usable for most people — even those who are used to using high-pressure faucets.

Design

The Wingsol WS-FM001 is made almost entirely from stainless steel. The metallic exterior has a brushed texture, making it a great fit if you have a kitchen design that’s oriented toward being understated and simple. The filter is heavy in the hand due to its metal construction. However, despite being made from durable materials, the filter doesn’t feel quite as polished as other models we’ve tested.

### In the Box

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/wingsol-faucet-water-filter-ws-fm001-pac-box-clecgn7tn0002ro888h1fe71s.jpg" alt="The full content of the Wingsol WS-FM001’s shipping box." width="300px" height="200px">

*   No. of Accessories: 14

Besides the filter housing and the filter block, a large bundle of adapters is also in the box. There are nine adapters in total, four made from metal and five made from plastic. You also get four rubber seals to secure the filter to the faucet better.

Overall, the content of the shipping box includes:

*   The filter housing
*   The filter block
*   A manual
*   Four metal adapters
*   Five plastic adapters
*   Four separate rubber seals
*   A pack of plumbing tape

### Weight & Dimensions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/wingsol-faucet-water-filter-ws-fm001-pac-dimensions-clecgol0u0003ro88dwv557pp.jpg" alt="The dimensions of the Wingsol WS-FM001 filter. Its length is 5 inches, width 2.7 inches, and height 5 inches." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 5.0" (12.7 cm)

Width: 2.7" (6.9 cm)

Height: 5.0" (12.7 cm)

Weight: 1.4 lbs (0.6 kg)

Due to being made entirely from stainless steel, the Wingsol WS-FM001 is the heaviest out of all the models we tested at 1.4 pounds. As a result, it feels very solid in the hand. But if you have a weakened faucet at home, the weight of the filter can be problematic to deal with.

While the filter is larger than most models we tested in the lab, it didn’t get in the way while we were using and testing it. Most of its bulk is over the top of the faucet, where it’s out of the way.

### 7.2 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/wingsol-faucet-water-filter-ws-fm001-pac-build-quality-clecgphqr0004ro88cvfl7mdq.jpg" alt="The silver, metallic Wingsol WS-FM001 faucet-mount water filter is laid on a grey table." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/wingsol-faucet-water-filter-ws-fm001-pac-build-quality-1-clecgpz3t0005ro88as943a0o.jpg" alt="The two nozzles of the Wingsol WS-FM001 faucet-mount water filter." width="300px" height="200px">

The housing is built almost entirely from stainless steel, which is why it has such a hefty weight in the hand. However, while the solid material is a good sign durability-wise, upon closer inspection, other than the premium material, the manufacturing of the filter is subpar.

The large, canister-shaped filter compartment is basically two halves of stainless steel pieces locked together by a swivel threading and a watertight rubber seal. Unlike other filters we’ve tested, the interior of the filter compartment isn’t lined with plastic or (as far as we know) isn’t treated with an anti-microbial layer.

While Wingsol doesn’t claim to be able to treat germs, because of this, you’ll still have to clean the filter once every couple of months to make sure that nothing bad is leaking into the water.

Additionally, while the material is claimed to be stainless steel, puzzlingly, we found traces of rust in the inner components of the filter after using the filter for a while. The rust is a potential reason why the filtered water we collected had a slightly darker, murkier color than samples we collected from other filters.

### 8.0 - Filter Piece

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/wingsol-faucet-water-filter-ws-fm001-pac-filter-piece-clecgr3kv0006ro88ev2hb1cl.jpg" alt="The Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC) filter block of the Wingsol WS-FM001 water filter." width="300px" height="200px">

Filter Model: WS-FM001-PAC replacement filter

Filtration Process: Powdered Activated Carbon

Certifications: ANSI Standard 42 and 53

Filter Capacity: 320 gallons

Wingsol doesn’t go into specifics about how its filter is made or by what mechanism it cleans water. Fortunately, they did disclose that it’s made from PAC ([Powdered Activated Carbon](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/powdered-activated-carbon)). This is the reason why Wingsol recommends the user flush the filter for at least 5 minutes before use.

While we didn’t see any black water coming out of the filter when we flushed it to indicate that there’s activated carbon inside the filter, a FAQ answer from Wingsol notes that “black water seldom happens” and that flushing is merely a precaution.

According to Wingsol, the PAC filter can remove sediments with sizes down to 2µm and last for 320 gallons.

### 10 - Routing Valve

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/wingsol-faucet-water-filter-ws-fm001-pac-routing-valve-clecgsaam0007ro8824zy792y.jpg" alt="The rotating handle of the Wingsol WS-FM001 water filter’s routing valve." width="300px" height="200px">

Type of Valve: Rotating

The handle for the routing valve of the Wingsol WS-FM001, similar to the rest of the filter, looks metallic. However, upon closer inspection, it’s actually made from chrome-plated plastic. This isn’t a concern, considering how the handle looks and feels solid.

As the handle turns, it operates a special ball joint inside the filter. The joint has several openings that let plain tap water pass through the filter while in plain water mode. When switched to filtered water mode, the joint will redirect the tap water into the filter block for filtration.

Usability

*   Installation (25%) - **10**/undefined
    
*   Ease of Use (30%) - **9.0**/undefined
    
*   Leak (35%) - **10**/undefined
    
*   Maintenance (10%) - **10**/undefined
    

Using the Wingsol WS-FM001 is as simple as installing it, then flipping the routing valve’s handle back and forth to either get plain or clean water through either nozzle of the filter.

The installation process for the WS-FM001 is easy. Slip the rotating collar on the head of the faucet, then rotate the ring on the collar until it tightens around the faucet and anchors the filter housing to it.

We didn’t find any leaking during installation, and the filter replacement process is easy.

### 10 - Installation

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-filters/wingsol-faucet-water-filter-ws-fm001-pac-installation-clecgt9ki0008ro884s0b3pt2.jpg" alt="A metal faucet adapter is fixed onto the mount of the Wingsol WS-FM001." width="300px" height="200px">

The Wingsol WS-FM001 is installed on our filter test rig, which has a faucet with external threading. As a result, we can immediately slip the filter onto the faucet without needing to use an adapter.

If your faucet has internal threading, Wingsol provides nine faucet adapters in the box that you can use.

### 9.0 - Ease of Use

The Wingsol WS-FM001 is extremely easy to use. Once the filter is secured on the faucet, turn the tap on and flip the handle of the routing valve back and forth. Set the handle in the horizontal position to get filtered water, and set it to the vertical position to get plain water.

### 10 - Leak

The Wingsol never leaked during and after installation. The locking collar anchors the filter housing tightly onto the faucet, and the watertight rubber sealing does its job excellently.

### 10 - Maintenance

Filter Indicator: N/A

Replacement: 6 months

The Wingsol WS-FM001 is very easy to maintain overall. The filter piece that’s included in the box can last around 6 months before needing a replacement (it has a maximum filtering lifespan of 320 gallons).

When it’s time for a replacement, grab the filter compartment and twist the upper piece until it pops out. You’ll be able to remove the filter and replace it with a new one. All that’s left to do is re-assemble the filter compartment’s cap, flush the new filter, then use as normal!

The filter block that comes with the WS-FM001 is still available for purchase online as of February 2023. It’s the Wingsol PAC Filter Cartridge ([WS-PAC-01](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JG3941M?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=lunagfwf5-20&linkId=cd171e091f3ed4c8c738d1077a95c9d4&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)).

But it’s worth noting that other than the PAC filter, depending on your needs, you can pick from four different types of filters, as well:

*   Wingsol PC Filter ([WS-PC-1P](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0995FZ839?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=lunagfwf5-20&linkId=cd171e091f3ed4c8c738d1077a95c9d4&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)): Two-stage water filter that can reduce sediments, sand, dust, and debris alongside chemicals and dissolved minerals in the water. This type can remove sediment down to a size of 1µm and lasts for 200 gallons.
*   Wingsol CRM Filter ([WS-CRM-1P](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07S99GT43?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=lunagfwf5-20&linkId=cd171e091f3ed4c8c738d1077a95c9d4&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)): A ceramic filter that uses the small pores of ceramic materials to remove contaminants. It can remove sediment down to a size of 0.5µm and lasts 250 gallons.
*   Wingsol 5-in-1 Filter ([WS-5in1-1P](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BD1721L?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=lunagfwf5-20&linkId=cd171e091f3ed4c8c738d1077a95c9d4&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)): 5-in-1 pleated filters that can reduce sediments and debris, remove chemicals, and add minerals to your water for a refreshing taste. It can remove sediment down to a size of 0.1µm and lasts for 220 gallons.
*   Wingsol Chloramine Filter ([WS-Chloramine-1P](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09L7Y6Q5D?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=lunagfwf5-20&linkId=cd171e091f3ed4c8c738d1077a95c9d4&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)): A filter built specifically to combat chloramine in the water. The best choice if your top concern is the chlorine from the water treatment plant ruining the taste and odor of your tap water. It can eliminate sediments of sizes down to 1µm and lasts for 200 gallons.

The filter doesn’t come with a filter change indicator, so you’ll have to keep your own log to know exactly when it’s time to switch out the filter with a new one.
