The Hamilton Beach 38529K topped our list among nine products due to its outstanding scores across all categories. As for the Crux 14620, despite its attractive appearance, it falls short in cooking performance and build quality.

Priced at $61.70, the Hamilton Beach offers great value with its detachable and reversible pan with a ceramic non-stick coating. It ensures easy cleaning and safe cooking, delivering perfectly cooked pancakes and juicy steaks.

In contrast, the Crux impresses with its polished copper linings, but its pancakes were average, and the heating cycle wasn’t suitable for a medium-rare steak. Though it had better heat distribution than other medium-sized skillets, its low temperature stabilization point hindered its ability to cook food perfectly like the Hamilton Beach.

Moreover, the Crux skillet’s coating on the pan rim showed chipping, and the base had grainy specs protruding. These issues detracted from its overall quality despite being priced cheaper, at $46.80.
