The Hamilton Beach Ceramic Non-Stick Electric Skillet 38529K and the Nesco Non-Stick Electric Skillet ES-08 are both exceptional products for their sizes and goals. One of the standout features of the Hamilton Beach skillet is its detachable 7.5 qt pan, which is lightweight, reversible, and easy to clean. The ceramic non-stick coating is safer and more durable than Teflon (like that of the Nesco), providing excellent cooking results in all of our tests. On the other hand, the Nesco skillet's small size contributed to the most even heat distribution and fastest heating among all tested skillets. However, this high conductivity requires careful temperature management to avoid burning delicate foods like pancakes. The Hamilton Beach pan is easier to clean and safer to use. Meanwhile, the Nesco skillet, with its 1.8 qt deep pan, is suitable for submerging a pack of instant ramen, making it a practical choice for college students. While the Hamilton Beach skillet offers dishwasher-safe convenience and overall durability, the Nesco skillet's pan is not dishwasher-safe, though the lid is. Moreover, the Nescoâ€™s hard padded base does not grip surfaces well, so caution is needed to prevent accidents when handling hot liquids.
