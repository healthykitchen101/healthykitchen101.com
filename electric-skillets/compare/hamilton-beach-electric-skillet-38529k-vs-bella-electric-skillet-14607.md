Overall, the Hamilton Beach Ceramic Non-Stick Electric Skillet 38529K excels across all test categories and topped our best-to-buy list among nine selected products. Meanwhile, the Bella Non-Stick Electric Skillet 14607 offers a more budget-friendly option that still delivers strong performance for high-heat cooking tasks.

The Hamilton Beach stands out with its reversible and detachable 7.5 qt pan that features a ceramic non-stick coating similar to the Bella. This skillet excelled in cooking tasks, producing perfectly golden pancakes and juicy, tender medium-rare steaks. Designed to serve 4-5 people, it offers exceptional value with a price tag of just $61.70.

On the other hand, the Bella 14607 is 12 inches and priced at just $32.90. Itâ€™s the best skillet for searing two servings of steaks, thanks to its great heat distribution and fast heating times. Unfortunately, it performed only averagely with pancakes. Moreover, some stubborn burn-ons didn't come off easily, and there were signs of chipping, possibly due to manufacturing flaws.
