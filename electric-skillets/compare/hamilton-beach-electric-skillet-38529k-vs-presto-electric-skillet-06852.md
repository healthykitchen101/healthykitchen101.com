The 16-inch Presto Electric Skillet 06852, priced at $63, could have been a top contender if not for its large size being outclassed by our top picks with the supreme champion being the Hamilton Beach Ceramic Non-Stick Electric Skillet 38529K. The Hamilton Beach excels in both design and performance while being slightly cheaper at $61.70. The detachable, lightweight, and reversible pan has a ceramic non-stick coating that is easy to clean and safer than Teflon of the Presto. It delivered excellent cooking results on our tests, perfectly golden pancakes and juicy medium-rare steaks. On the other hand, the Presto boasts excellent maximum temperature retention and temperature stability but its heat distribution is marginally less even, leading to faster steak searing but slightly uneven pancake coloration. Priced at $63, it unfortunately lacks fancy design features like that of the Hamilton Beach. Most detriment is its unusual absence of anti-slip pads, causing the pan to move around too much during cooking.
