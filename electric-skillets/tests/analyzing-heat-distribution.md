**Analyzing Heat Distribution** is the first thing we do when assessing an [electric skillet’s performance](https://healthykitchen101.com/electric-skillets/reviews/best/). This test takes up **20%** of the performance score and gives an indication of what to expect in the two follow-up cooking tests. Check out how we do this with oil absorbent sheets, sugar-water, and two infrared thermometers!

Using Sugar as Our Surface Heat Indicator
-----------------------------------------

Sugar **changes color** very noticeably when exposed to heat, so it’s an excellent indicator of heat distribution on the surface of a skillet. One can also use flour but it’s messier, plus flour isn’t **translucent** like sugar.

However, just spreading sugar on the pan can result in unevenness. In addition, it’s  very difficult to capture consistent data, not to mention the cleaning afterwards.

Measuring the amount of sugar to saturate 1 liter of 25 °C water.

Therefore, we take room temperature **water** (77°F / 25 °C), **saturate** it with **sugar** (1.8 kg of sugar to 1 liter of 25 °C water), and use an **oil absorbent sheet** to soak up the mixture. 

Much more resilient than paper towels, we use these sheets to cover the pan’s entire surface. This produces a **uniform surface** impression which can be used as a fair assessment for any skillet.

Throughout the process, we used up less than half a liter (< 17 oz) of [saturated sugar water](https://www.inspiritvr.com/rate-of-dissolving-dissolving-sugar-study-guide/) for twenty 8 x 8 inches (20 x 20 cm) sheets. For the large electric skillets (> 14 inches), we had to add half a sheet to a full sheet and place them as close to one another as possible.

Preparing the Infrared Thermometer for Measuring Temperature
------------------------------------------------------------

Preparing the infrared thermometer for measuring temperature.

We use [infrared thermometers](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/best/infrared-thermometers/) for measuring temperature. They are **calibrated** following our testing procedures. The sheets ensure **consistent emissivity**, and we make sure to keep the **proper distance to spot ratio**.

The infrared thermometer reads the temperature at the center of the Presto Electric Skillet 06852 to be 390°F.

We have one infrared thermometer fixed on a stand and point it at the **center** of the skillet. Once the temperature there reaches **400°F**, we use another thermometer to measure the temperatures of **5 points** on the skillet’s surface to get the average for the final scoring.

An infrared thermometer reads 422°F." width="640" height="427">

The infrared thermometer reads the temperature at the heating element away from its socket of the Presto Electric Skillet 06852 to be 422°F.

We decided the points would include the **center**, **halfway** to one edge **towards** the heating element socket, one edge **towards** the heating element socket but not touching the pan’s wall. Likewise, we measure halfway to one edge **away from** the heating element socket, and one edge **away from** the heating element socket but not touching the pan’s wall.

An infrared thermometer reads 387°F." width="640" height="427">

The infrared thermometer reads the temperature at the heating element towards its socket of the Presto Electric Skillet 06852 to be 387°F.

We noticed during our testing that the temperature at the edges **towards** the heating element socket are usually **lower** than away from it. This is because the two ends of the heating element are closer to one another and, therefore, further away from the edges of the pan.

Testing Steps
-------------

These are all the steps we followed in testing each and every electric skillet we purchased:

**1.** Prepare one infrared thermometer, fix it on a stand, and point it at the center of and 12 inches away from the subject skillet.

**2\.** Prepare a mixture of saturated sugar water (1800 g sugar to 1 liter of 25 ℃ water) in a shallow, fitting container like a baking pan.

**3\.** Lay an oil absorbent sheet flat into the sugar water.

**8\.** Immediately turn off the electric skillet so the temperature stops rising.

**9\.** Quickly use another thermometer to check the temperatures of 5 designated points.

How We Score
------------

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/discussing-evaluation-heat-distribution-electric-skillets-cltfk1sok000ywz88dwwi0v8z.jpg" alt="A camera, an infrared thermometer, an electric skillet, and four people discussing." width="640" height="427">

Our team at Healthy Kitchen 101 discussing the heat distribution evaluation of the Bella Non-Stick Electric Skillet 14607.

The heat distribution score is calculated based on the **average temperature difference** (%) between the 5 designated points.

For theoretical accuracy, a skillet can only get a 10/10 by having 100% even heat distribution. Based on our collected data, we decided to subtract **1 point** for **each 5% difference**. We felt no skillet should show over 25% uneven heat distribution, which is also our limit for a 0/10 failed product.

Additionally, the **color pattern** of the caramelized sugar gives us a visual representation—the higher the temperature, the darker the caramel gets in that area. 

As you can see in the photos below, the center of the skillet is 400°F with a golden brown color. It gets gradually darker until it’s completely dark as when the heating element reaches 420°F, and sometimes even more. Towards the edges of the pan however, the temperature gets exponentially lighter where it’s only around 320°F.

*   **10/10:** 0% difference between the 5 points
*   **9/10:** 5% difference
*   **8/10:** 10% difference
*   **7/10:** 15% difference
*   **6/10:** 20% difference
*   **5/10:** 25% difference
*   **0/10:** > 25% difference
