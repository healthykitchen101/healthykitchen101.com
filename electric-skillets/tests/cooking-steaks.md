Every gastronome loves a good steak! For this reason, and others, we chose cooking steaks as one of our two food tests for electric skillet performance. Cooking Steaks takes up 40% of the performance score. 

In this test, evaluate the skillet’s **preheating time**, high heat for good **crusting,** stable temperature for ideal **doneness** and **juiciness**, and not to mention **ease-of-cleaning**.

And, all of this can be done with the most basic of recipes!

Our Electric Skillet Steak Recipe
---------------------------------

To keep our team focused on testing and evaluating, we decided to go with the most basic steak recipe. This one was developed by our head chef [Tuyet Pham](https://healthykitchen101.com/about/#tuyet-pham) who dropped by from [Healthy Recipes 101](https://healthyrecipes101.com/beef/recipe/steak-eggs/):

*   An 8 oz, 1.38-inch thick top blade steak (226.8 g, 3.5 cm)
*   1 tbsp olive oil (0.47 oz, 13.3 g)
*   1/2 tsp salt (0.07 oz, 2 g)
*   1/2 tsp pepper (0.04 oz, 1.2 g)
*   1/2 tsp garlic powder (0.03 oz, 0.8 g)
*   1 tbsp unsalted butter (0.5 oz, 14 g)
*   1 sprig rosemary

Searing a steak requires high heat equal to 400–450°F. Therefore, we chose to preheat all the subject skillets to **400°F** (checked with an infrared thermometer). This is also commonly the highest temperature setting on most electric skillets.

To run the test, we insert a meat thermometer horizontally into the center of the steak to keep track of the internal temperature. The [USDA](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/safe-temperature-chart) recommends a safe minimum of 145°F.

For our **1.38-inch top blade** steak, searing the two sides and the edges is enough to cook the meat through to a medium-rare. If you have a ≥ 1.5 inch steak, you can simply cover the lid and allow the meat to cook a little further.

We had the best results across skillets when cooking the first side for **3 min 30 sec** and then the second side for **4 min**. The second side takes longer because, at 400°F, electric skillets tend to cycle off around the 6-minute mark to prevent the temperature from rising too high.

For the edges, ones with a fat cap took around **2 minutes** and those without took **1 min** to **1 min 30** sec each.

We then added fresh rosemary and butter for added aroma and flavor. We left each side of the steak in the fragrant butter for **30 seconds** before turning off the skillet.

The steak’s internal temperature should be around **135°F** at this point. Then, after allowing the meat to rest for at least **3 minutes**, the residual heat should continue raising the internal temperature to around **145°F**, resulting in a perfect medium-rare steak.

What We Learned from Cooking Steaks in Electric Skillets
--------------------------------------------------------

Because electric skillets **heat up in cycles**, the pan won’t get as hot as an iron skillet on a gas stove. The crust won’t be as thick and crispy, but still plenty delicious. With all the butter basting and the meat juice, the skillet can get quite dirty— which allowed us to really test how easy it is to clean!

If the skillet takes too long to cook the steak, it may be because the temperature isn’t high enough. This can lead to the outside of the steak lacking in color and the inside overcooked. 

Our head chef’s supervision proved invaluable in the process otherwise we would have wasted too many valuable steaks.

**Chef’s tips:** Let the steak cool down to room temperature to allow the muscle fibers to relax which ensures even cooking later. Season the steak about 15 minutes before cooking to allow the meat to absorb the flavors. Pat the steak dry with a paper towel if necessary before searing.

Testing Steps
-------------

1.  Let the steak cool down to room temperature.
2.  Season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
3.  Insert a meat thermometer horizontally to the center of the steak to monitor the internal temperature.
4.  Prepare one infrared thermometer, fixed on a stand, and point it at the center of and 12 inches away from the subject skillet. 
5.  Turn on the thermometer and the subject skillet until the temperature reads 400°F on the thermometer.
6.  Add olive oil and place the steak in the skillet.
7.  Sear the first side until completely caramelized. It should take about 3 min 30 sec.
8.  Flip the steak and sear the other side to the same degree. This side should take a total of 4 minutes.
9.  Sear the edge with the fat cap for around 2 minutes.
10.  Sear the other edges for around 1 min 30 sec each.
11.  Lay the steak down on the first side then add butter and rosemary on top.
12.  Flip the steak and make sure to coat it in butter evenly.
13.  Continue searing each side in butter for around 30 seconds.
14.  Once the internal temperature reaches around 135°F, remove the steak from the skillet, and place it on a cutting board.
15.  Let it rest for at least 3 minutes (or half the cooking duration).
16.  Cut the steak, taste, and evaluate.
17.  Clean the pan once everything cools down.
