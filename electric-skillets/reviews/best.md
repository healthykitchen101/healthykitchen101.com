Electric skillets (also known as electric fry pans) are extremely versatile. They can sauté, fry, grill, steam, and even make hotpots. All this is possible because they conduct heat over a wide surface and have select temperature settings.

Additionally, an electric skillet can serve as your main cooking appliance or provide an extra cooking surface when needed. Best of all, they are easy to clean and store away. Find out more and which of our best electric skillets is the one for you.

How We Test
-----------

Hands-on testing has given our team at _Healthy Kitchen 101_ insights and perspectives that we could never have anticipated.

We evaluate an electric skillet’s performance with 3 tests:

*   **Analyzing Heat Distribution:** We soak  an **oil absorbent sheet** in **saturated sugar water**, drain off excess liquid, and flatten it onto the skillet surface. Then, we heat the skillet until the central area reaches **400°F** and use an infrared thermometer to measure 5 key points towards the edges. Afterwards, we collate the data and tally a score.
*   **Making Pancakes:** We chose this test for its simple and universally common recipe. It also shows how fast the skillet preheats to **350°F** and how it maintains a stable temperature needed to cook up **steamy**, **fluffy** and **golden brown** pancakes.
*   **Cooking Steaks:** Cooking a steak allows us to test preheating to **400°F** and provides an assessment of **good crusting** and **even cooking** for the perfect **medium-rare** steak. We keep the seasoning to its most basic and garnished with butter and rosemary. 

For design, we rate the fabrication materials of the pan, lid, base, thermostat, and all the key features. Since design directly impacts user-friendliness. We assess how easy it is to control the thermostat, to maneuver the pan while cooking, and to clean up afterward.

Reviews of the Best Electric Skillets in 2024
---------------------------------------------

Here are our concise reviews of the best electric skillets in 2024, tested and evaluated.

1\. Best Overall: Hamilton Beach Electric Skillet 38529K

*   Great heat distribution
*   Stable temperatures
*   Sizzling hot pan for searing
*   Durable ceramic non-stick coating
*   High build quality

*   Handles need clip-locks

The Hamilton Beach Ceramic Non-Stick Electric Skillet 38529K is hands down our best-to-buy choice. It has the **highest** performance score, best design quality, and is the **easiest** to use.

The skillet is top-tier in terms of **even heat distribution**. The average temperature difference between 5 key points from the center to the edge of the pan was only 5.9%— compared to a typical 10%. This earned it an impressive score of 8.8/10.

It took only **3 min 20 sec** to preheat the pan to 350°F and a couple of minutes each side to cook a 3.17 oz pancake. More importantly, every pancake was perfectly steamy and fluffy with a golden brown texture (9.5/10). The 15-inch pan can cook 3 to 4 pancakes at a time.

In our other test, we cooked an **8 oz**, **1.38-inch** top blade steak. The skillet took **4 min30 sec** to preheat to 400°F which was fast for its size. We were more impressed, however, with the stable temperature. The pan didn’t get to 500°F like some other skillets so the crust wasn’t the thickest or crispiest. However, the steak was **incredibly juicy** and reached a **perfect medium-rare**, thus earning it a 9.5/10.

The **Durathon ceramic non-stick coating** is stronger than Teflon and less likely to crack or peel. Plus, with zero PTFEs and PFOAs, you can enjoy healthier cooking. In our tests, grease-free pancakes and the steaks slid right off the surface. Not to mention the pan’s **copper color** looks great on the kitchen counter!

The user-friendly pan simply **lifts up** from its base by its side handles and has additional leg rests for serving directly from the table. However, we felt click locks would have made the handles more secure. Also, the base doesn’t fold to make dishwashing or storing easier.

2\. Runner-Up: Presto Foldaway Electric Skillet 06857

*   Highly even heat distribution
*   Stable temperatures
*   Sizzling hot pan for searing
*   Convenient foldaway feature
*   High build quality

*   Teflon non-stick coating
*   Lid not the best fit

The 16-inch Presto Foldaway Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06857 is a very close runner-up. Compared to the Hamilton, it’s overall more user-friendly with only slight differences in cooking performance. Despite all this, significant demerits were the Teflon coating (not ceramic) and the loose-fitting lid.

Its thick cast aluminum pan (0.12 in) and large rectangular heating element effected excellent heat distribution. We saw an average of **5.7%** in temperature differences in 5 points from the center of the pan of the edges (compared to 5.9% for the Hamilton) scoring an impressive 8.9/10.

The PFOA-free Teflon non-stick coating, both inside and outside, allowed us to make pancakes without any butter or oil. After **3 min 50 sec** of preheating, we had a **steamy and fluffy** pancake scoring 9.5/10—just slightly better than its main rivals.

The skillet took **6 min** to preheat to 400°F—not the fastest but the temperature was still very stable. It  seared a **medium-rare** steak to almost to perfection, or worthy of a 9/10, but the crusting wasn’t as good as the Hamilton.

The best thing about the Presto’s design is how you just  unlock the two clips to fold down the stay-cool handles, and **detach the pan** from the base. The base additionally fits upside down inside the 3-inch deep pan for **easy and compact storing**.

The pan has a spout for pouring liquid so the tempered glass lid doesn’t need a steam vent. All parts are **dishwasher-safe** except for the thermostat. Nonetheless, thanks to the non-stick coating, we found a quick hand-washing was more than enough after cooking the steak.

Honorable Mentions
------------------

*   **The Presto Electric Skillet 06852** could have made the list if not for our top two contenders. Its base is not detachable and its performance was slightly less than the Presto 06857 while the Hamilton Beach has a better non-stick coating for the pan.
*   **The Ovente Non-Stick Electric Skillet SK11112B** has a round and shallow pan. It heats up extremely fast to a high temperature which, although excellent for searing meat, is not at all suitable for delicate carbohydrates like pancakes.
*   **The Crux Non-Stick Electric Skillet 14620** was on par with the GreenLife in terms of cooking performance for a medium-sized pan. However, the non-stick coating wasn’t as good nor as eye-catching.

Why Should You Buy
------------------

Here are 5 good reasons why you should buy an electric skillet if you have never tried one before:

1.  Convenient and versatile.
2.  Keeps food warm and ready to serve.
3.  Cooks faster and more efficiently.
4.  Reduces residual heat in the kitchen.

FAQ
---

**1\. What can I cook with an electric skillet?**

With an electric skillet you can sauté, fry, sear, steam, even make hotpots, and more. This is largely due to their wide and deep cooking area with precise temperature control.

**2\. Is the non-stick coating in electric skillets safe?**

The general consensus is that ceramic coating is safer than Teflon / [PTFE](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/polytetrafluoroethylene). Ceramic coating is believed to be stronger and less likely to chip. Regardless, you can get stainless steel skillets which don't have a coating.

**3\. How do I know when an electric skillet / pan is hot enough?**

When the pan reaches the input temperature, the working indicator should switch off. Quality and performance differ, so if you don’t have an infrared thermometer, drop a teaspoon of water in the pan. If it forms droplets and swirls, the pan has reached 350°F.

**4\. How do I clean my electric skillet?**

The best way to clean an electric skill is by hand with a mild detergent and non-abrasive sponge. This may help the non-stick coating last longer, but most are dishwasher-friendly except for the thermostat.

**5\. Can I use metal utensils or scrubbers on my electric skillet?**

You shouldn’t use metal utensils and metal scrubbers on your skillet. These may damage the non-stick coating and expose food to the aluminum base which can be a [health concern](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.754).

**6\. Should I soak my electric skillet in water after cooking?**

You can soak your skillet in water to remove stuck food, but you must first wait for the pan to cool down. Thermal shock can lead to rapid expansion and shrinking of the metal base, which can in turn damage the precious non-stick coating.
