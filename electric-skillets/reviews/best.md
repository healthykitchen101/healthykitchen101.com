Electric skillets (also known as electric fry pans) are extremely versatile. They can sauté, fry, grill, steam, and even make hotpots. All this is possible because they conduct heat over a wide surface and have select temperature settings.

Additionally, an electric skillet can serve as your main cooking appliance or provide an extra cooking surface when needed. Best of all, they are easy to clean and store away. Find out more and which of our best electric skillets is the one for you.

How We Test
-----------

Hands-on testing has given our team at _Healthy Kitchen 101_ insights and perspectives that we could never have anticipated.

We evaluate an electric skillet’s performance with 3 tests:

*   **Analyzing Heat Distribution:** We soak  an **oil absorbent sheet** in **saturated sugar water**, drain off excess liquid, and flatten it onto the skillet surface. Then, we heat the skillet until the central area reaches **400°F** and use an infrared thermometer to measure 5 key points towards the edges. Afterwards, we collate the data and tally a score.
*   **Making Pancakes:** We chose this test for its simple and universally common recipe. It also shows how fast the skillet preheats to **350°F** and how it maintains a stable temperature needed to cook up **steamy**, **fluffy** and **golden brown** pancakes.
*   **Cooking Steaks:** Cooking a steak allows us to test preheating to **400°F** and provides an assessment of **good crusting** and **even cooking** for the perfect **medium-rare** steak. We keep the seasoning to its most basic and garnished with butter and rosemary. 

For design, we rate the fabrication materials of the pan, lid, base, thermostat, and all the key features. Since design directly impacts user-friendliness. We assess how easy it is to control the thermostat, to maneuver the pan while cooking, and to clean up afterward.

Reviews of the Best Electric Skillets in 2024
---------------------------------------------

Here are our concise reviews of the best electric skillets in 2024, tested and evaluated.

Honorable Mentions
------------------

*   **The Presto Electric Skillet 06852** could have made the list if not for our top two contenders. Its base is not detachable and its performance was slightly less than the Presto 06857 while the Hamilton Beach has a better non-stick coating for the pan.
*   **The Ovente Non-Stick Electric Skillet SK11112B** has a round and shallow pan. It heats up extremely fast to a high temperature which, although excellent for searing meat, is not at all suitable for delicate carbohydrates like pancakes.
*   **The Crux Non-Stick Electric Skillet 14620** was on par with the GreenLife in terms of cooking performance for a medium-sized pan. However, the non-stick coating wasn’t as good nor as eye-catching.

Why Should You Buy
------------------

1.  Convenient and versatile.
2.  Keeps food warm and ready to serve.
3.  Cooks faster and more efficiently.

A typical electric skillet has three main parts: a circular or rectangular pan, a tempered glass lid, and a thermostat / temperature control probe. All parts are usually fully immersible in water with the exception of the thermostat.

Most electric skillets work well enough. However, better ones excel in terms of heating speed, even cooking, user-friendliness, and how much space they take up. Below are 8 things to keep in mind when looking for the best electric skillet.

1.  Choose the right size for your needs.

FAQ
---

**1\. What can I cook with an electric skillet?**

With an electric skillet you can sauté, fry, sear, steam, even make hotpots, and more. This is largely due to their wide and deep cooking area with precise temperature control.

**2\. Is the non-stick coating in electric skillets safe?**

The general consensus is that ceramic coating is safer than Teflon / [PTFE](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/polytetrafluoroethylene). Ceramic coating is believed to be stronger and less likely to chip. Regardless, you can get stainless steel skillets which don't have a coating.

**3\. How do I know when an electric skillet / pan is hot enough?**

When the pan reaches the input temperature, the working indicator should switch off. Quality and performance differ, so if you don’t have an infrared thermometer, drop a teaspoon of water in the pan. If it forms droplets and swirls, the pan has reached 350°F.

**4\. How do I clean my electric skillet?**

The best way to clean an electric skill is by hand with a mild detergent and non-abrasive sponge. This may help the non-stick coating last longer, but most are dishwasher-friendly except for the thermostat.

**5\. Can I use metal utensils or scrubbers on my electric skillet?**

You shouldn’t use metal utensils and metal scrubbers on your skillet. These may damage the non-stick coating and expose food to the aluminum base which can be a [health concern](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.754).

**6\. Should I soak my electric skillet in water after cooking?**

You can soak your skillet in water to remove stuck food, but you must first wait for the pan to cool down. Thermal shock can lead to rapid expansion and shrinking of the metal base, which can in turn damage the precious non-stick coating.
