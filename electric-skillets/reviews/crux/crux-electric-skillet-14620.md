The 12-inch Crux Non-Stick Electric Skillet 14620 posed a very **attractive aesthetic** with its gray exterior accentuated by polished copper linings. However, we wanted some more substance from it.

Compared to the GreenLife and Bella of the same size, it had better **heat distribution** and equally **fast heating speed**. Unfortunately, we found that the skillet’s temperature stabilization point was a bit too low to cook food how we wanted it.

In addition, the coating had some chipping similar to the Bella. With the price of **$46.80** (at the time of writing), the GreenLife is by far the better choice.

**Things We Like**

*   Fast heating
*   Even heat distribution
*   Ceramic non-stick coating

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Chipped coating
*   Stubborn burn-ons may require some effort

Crux is a kitchenware brand founded in NYC in 2016 as part of the Made by Gather™. With a focus on premium design, they conceptualize products including electric skillets, air-fryer toaster ovens, waffle makers, sous vide cookers, and stand mixers.

With that said, the Crux Non-Stick Electric Skillet 14620 certainly impressed visually at first and our initial tests of frying eggs and boiling water gave good results. Let’s see what else it will have in store for us!

The Crux Non-Stick Electric Skillet 14620 had the best heat distribution among our tested medium-sized skillets. That strength, however, only carried to an adequate pancake score and a subpar steak score.

### Analyzing Heat Distribution

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/crux-electric-skillet-14620-analyzing-heat-distribution-clu0o6bvm0006iq88dbebg2do.jpg" alt="The Crux Non-Stick Electric Skillet 14620 with a white oil-absorbent sheet covering the surface of the pan. The dark double circles indicate where the heating element is." width="300px" height="200px">

Temperature: High heat / 400°F

Temperature Differences: 5.2%

The Crux showed a highly even heat distribution which is a rarity in medium-sized skillets. Normally, the temperatures at the edges are lower due to the pan being square but the heating element circular.

To evaluate temperature consistency across the skillet's surface, we utilized a saturated sugar water-soaked oil absorbent sheet placed atop. Then, we heated the pan to 400°F and employed an infrared thermometer.

Our assessment, conducted at five distinct points spanning from the center to the corners of the pan, unveiled an average temperature difference of **5.2%**. This performance translates to an excellent 9/10 in our dataset, even slightly better than all of our larger skillets including the top 1 Hamilton Beach 38529K.

### Making Pancakes

Heating Time: 2 min

Temperature: Medium heat / 350°F

The Crux preheated to 350°F in exactly **2 min**, just the right score of a 10/10. Despite its slightly lower power draw, the smaller surface area of the skillet facilitated faster heating, which understandably outperformed the larger skillets.

With our homemade pancake batter, we gave 1 min 10 sec to the top and 3 min to the flipside of our **3.17 oz** pancake. Unfortunately, the even heat distribution didn’t translate to an even color on the pancake.

While most of the pancake was a **golden brown color**, it had a lot of **mottled white spots**. The same batch of batter was used in other skillets before and afterward so it wasn’t the problem.

Also, since the pan was relatively thin, the edges of the pancake got a bit dark right where the heating element is. The silver lining was **steamy** inside, enough for a 7/10—quite a common score among medium-sized skillets.

Although this 12-inch pan has the capacity to comfortably accommodate 2 or even 3 pancakes simultaneously, we only prepared one pancake at a time during our testing. Depending on your pancake mix, you may need to adjust the cooking time accordingly.

While the non-stick coating eliminates the need for greasing the pan with butter or oil, it's recommended to lightly brush some oil across the pan's surface to prolong its lifespan.

### Cooking Steaks

In the background is the Crux Non-Stick Electric Skillet 14620." width="300px" height="200px">

Heating Time: 3 min

Temperature: High heat / 400°F

We first preheated the Bella to 400°F to make sure our **8 oz, 1.38-inch** top blade steak got the best crusting possible. Similar to other medium-sized electric skillets in our data set, this took only **3 min** which translated to a commendable 9/10.

After seasoning the steak and inserting a meat thermometer, we seared each side for 4 min and 30 sec. Then, we seared the edge with the fat cap for 1 min and 30 sec, while the remaining edges were seared for 1 min each.

Afterward, we added fresh rosemary and butter, allowing each side to cook for an additional 1 min. The steak's internal temperature reached 142°F initially, which then increased to 145°F after resting for 3 minutes.

Since the heat didn’t stay high for long enough, the searing of both sides took a whole minute longer than similarly-sized skillets. And despite that, the crust was still **very thin**. We would later found out what exactly the problem was when checking the temperature oscialations down in the Ease of Use section.

The entire cooking process took 18 min 30 sec and made the steak go **slightly over** medium-rare. Therefore, the steak lost a significant amount of juice and became **slightly tough**. Our chef had no choice but to rate it a 6.5/10.

If we shortened the searing time for a more ideal doneness, we would compromise the already lackluster crust. So, we thought this was a fair compromise.

The Crux Non-Stick Electric Skillet 14620 has an attractive exterior and all the basic design features. The majority was of high quality but the all-important ceramic non-stick coating had some unfortunate chipping.

### 7.0 - Pan

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/crux-electric-skillet-14620-pan-clu0o6bof0002iq885sgrbdc1.jpg" alt="The pan of the Crux Non-Stick Electric Skillet 14620 is 11.8 inches in length, 11.8 inches in width, and 2.8 inches in depth." width="300px" height="200px">

Cooking Capacity:  6.8 qt.

Dimensions: L11.8 x W11.8 x H2.8 inches

Material: Cast aluminum

Coating: Ceramic

Handle: Thermosetting plastic

Spout: No

Dishwasher-Safe: Yes

The Crux skillet has a cast aluminum pan which is more durable than a non-cast pan (+3). The pan is merely 2 mm (0.8 in) thick but it didn’t deform under high heat and it proved to have heated up very evenly (+1). We calculated the total capacity to be around 6.8 quarts but the usable volume should be 6 quarts as the label states.

The skillet has a **ceramic non-stick coating** which is free of PTFE and PFOA (+2). Unfortunately, we found some tiny chippings on the coating’s surface (-0.5). 

The pan along with the attached base are dishwasher-safe (+2). Unlike some other pans we tested, this one does not have a pouring spout.

### 9.0 - Lid

Material: Tempered glass

Handle: Thermosetting plastic

Steam Vent: Yes

Dishwasher-Safe: Yes

The tempered glass lid is dishwasher-safe (+4). It features a thermosetting plastic handle and a steam vent to release pressure (+2). Moreover, the metal edging is precisely sized to fit the pan well (+3).

### 6.0 - Base

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/crux-electric-skillet-14620-base-clu0o6c5w000aiq88au557327.jpg" alt="The base of the Crux Non-Stick Electric Skillet 14620 has four stands with anti-slip pads." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Thermosetting plastic

Detachable: No

Anti-Slip Pads: Four

Dishwasher-Safe: Yes

You will notice that the flat base has four extra stands with anti-slip pads at the bottom (+2). These make the pan very sturdy despite its thermosetting plastic material being much lighter than metal (+2). The pan is not detachable so make sure your dishwasher is big enough to fit the entire skillet (+2).

### 7.0 - Thermostat

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/crux-electric-skillet-14620-thermostat-clu0o6bia0001iq88ea64g1oo.jpg" alt="The thermostat of the Crux Non-Stick Electric Skillet 14620 has 6 settings including Warm-200–250-300-350-400°F." width="300px" height="200px">

Temperature Range: Warm-200–250-300-350-400°F

Detachable: Yes

Indicator Light: Yes

Dishwasher-Safe: No

The detachable thermostat features a conventional design with a standard temperature range from 200 to 400°F, along with a keep warm setting of around 150°F (+3). It is well-designed with a seamless fit and is equipped with a working indicator light (+4). However, like most other thermostats, it is not dishwasher-safe.

The Crux Non-Stick Electric Skillet 14620 was user-friendly and its medium size fit well in the dishwasher as well as in the storage. Although cleaning was simple for the most part, we encountered challenges with persistent burnt residue such as caramel stains.

### 9.0 - Ease of Use

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/crux-electric-skillet-14620-ease-use-clu0o6bvj0005iq882fhqbpp9.jpg" alt="The Crux Non-Stick Electric Skillet 14620 with its thermostat inserted." width="300px" height="200px">

We encountered no issues with the fit of the electric thermostat, and found the indicator light to be easily visible (+3).

The temperature settings weren’t exactly imprecise but we found the skillet cycling off and then back on to around the exact input temperature instead of going past for around 50°F like most other skillets. This made the pan’s temperatures stabilize slightly below the intensity we desired (-1).

Nonetheless, the skillet's exterior consistently maintains a safe temperature, minimizing the risk of accidental burning, though it's essential to handle it by the handles only to ensure safety (+3). Furthermore, the anti-slip pads effectively prevented the pan from slipping and provided stability, even under vigorous use (+3).

### 8.5 - Cleaning and Storing

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/crux-electric-skillet-14620-cleaning-storing-clu0o6c5z000biq880ka6132p.jpg" alt="Burnt caramel on the surface of the Crux Non-Stick Electric Skillet 14620." width="300px" height="200px">

The ceramic non-stick coating of the Crux effectively releases food (+2). During our heat distribution test however, we found that it required multiple washes with warm water and dishwashing liquid to entirely remove the burnt caramel (-0.5).

On a positive note, regular clean-ups were effortless (+2). Additionally, all parts of the skillet, except for the thermostat, can conveniently go into the dishwasher (+2).

The skillet is really attractive so it looks good out on the counter, or you can put it back in the box for safe keeping (+3).
