### Analyzing Heat Distribution

Temperature: High heat / 400°F

Temperature Differences: 5.9%

The Hamilton Beach skillet showed **remarkably** even heat distribution. We put this down to the thick cast aluminum pan and large rectangular heating element. 

To assess temperature differences across the skillet's surface, we placed a saturated sugar water-soaked oil absorbent sheet on top. Then, we heated the pan to 400°F and used an infrared thermometer to measure 5 key temperature points.

Our measurements of these points, from the center to the edges of the pan, revealed an average temperature difference of only **5.9%**. The combined average of all the pans we tested was 10%. 

This impressive result earned the skillet a noteworthy rating of 8.8/10, positioning it  slightly below the medium-sized Crux 14620.

### Making Pancakes

Heating Time: 3 min 20 sec

Temperature: Medium heat / 350°F

The Hamilton Beach skillet took only **3 min 20 sec** to preheat to 350°F. An exceptional feat for its large size, thus earning a rating of 8.7 / 10.

Utilizing our original electric skillet pancake batter, we cooked a perfect **3.17 oz pancake** in just **4 min and 40 sec**. The top side took 1 min 30 sec and the flip side 3 min 10 sec.

The result was a **delightfully steamy** and **fluffy** pancake with a beautiful **golden brown** hue. This was worthy of a nearly flawless score of 9.5/10.

You may need to adjust cooking times based on your specific pancake mix. The spacious 15-inch pan can cook 3 or 4 pancakes at a time, but in our tests we cooked only one at a time.

Remarkably, the non-stick coating required no extra greasing. However, to prolong the pan's lifespan, it is recommended to brush on a light layer of oil.

### Cooking Steaks

Heating Time: 4 min 30 sec

Temperature: High heat / 400°F

To achieve the optimal crust on our **8 oz,** **1.38-inch** top blade steak, we preheated the Hamilton Beach to 400°F. This took only **4 min 30 sec**, which was a minute faster than average for the same size category. Nonetheless, it was slower than a small to medium-sized skillet, so it received just a 7.5/10.

We seared the first side for **3 min 25 sec** and the flip side for **4 min**. The second side took slightly longer because the skillet power cycled off at around 6 minutes in order not to spike the temperature too high.

The fat cap took 1 min 30 sec to sear and the other edges 1 min each. Finally, we added rosemary and butter and seared each side for an additional **1 min 30 sec**.

Even for its size, the skillet kept a **high and steady** heat. Unlike some other pans, the surface is completely flat. As a result, the Hamilton Beach produced a remarkably thick and crispy crust, albeit not as perfect as a cast iron skillet on gas.

Our meat probes showed the steak's internal temperature to be **133°F**, which rose to **139°F** after the mandatory 3 minutes of resting. This meticulous approach yielded a **perfect medium-rare** steak—**tender** and **juicy**, earning the skillet an outstanding rating of 9.5/10 from our chef.

The entire process took just over 16 minutes.
