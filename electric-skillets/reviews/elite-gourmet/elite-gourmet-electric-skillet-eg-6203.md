At 16 inches and 10.5 quarts, the Elite Gourmet Non-Stick Electric Skillet EG-6203# has the largest and deepest pan in our line-up, capable of frying chicken for 6 to 8 people. But that’s not all there is to our designated best deep pick.

The marble-coated raised honeycomb pan is both aesthetic and practical while being easy to clean. It produced excellent cooking results with the fastest preheating times among our large electric skillets. These were enough reasons for us to look past its uneven heat distribution.

The thermostat has a trigger release which is a rare and appreciated touch making it easier to remove. If we’re trying to be nitpicking about such a high-quality pan, we thought this large skillet could use a detachable and foldable base for easier storage. But with the price of only **$58.70** (at the time of writing), we couldn’t ask for more.

**Things We Like**

*   Raised honeycomb pan
*   Excellent cooking capacity
*   Fast heating speed
*   Stable temperatures
*   Durable marble non-stick coating
*   High build quality

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Heat distribution

We weren’t familiar with marble-coated, raised honeycomb pan of the Elite Gourmet Non-Stick Electric Skillet EG-6203# so we were excited to get down to business. During prenups, we didn’t expect much in terms of heating speed but that changed when we tried boiling some water. Also, cleaning up the fried eggs was surprisingly easier than we thought. Let’s see what else is in store!

Elite Gourmet by Maxi-Matic is a US-based Chinese brand of small kitchen appliances operating for more than 37 years. Besides electric kettles, they also manufacture toaster ovens, blenders, waffle makers, food dehydrators, deep fryers, and steamers to name a few.

The Elite Gourmet Non-Stick Electric Skillet EG-6203# has some of the best scores in making pancakes and cooking steaks with exceptional heating speed. However, its performance rating is dragged down by our heat distribution analysis.

### Analyzing Heat Distribution

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/elite-gourmet-electric-skillet-eg-6203-analyzing-heat-distribution-cltnuvhil003vwz88af9g7z9c.jpg" alt="5 temperature points on the surface of the Elite Gourmet Non-Stick Electric Skillet EG-6203 are 330°F, 377°F, 385°F, 349°F, and 293°F." width="300px" height="200px">

Temperature: High heat / 400°F

Temperature Differences: 13.3%

To detect the temperature differences across the skillet’s surface, we placed an oil absorbent sheet of saturated sugar water on top. We then heated the pan to 400°F and used an infrared thermometer to check key temperature points.

Since it’s the largest and deepest pan we’ve got, it didn’t surprise us that the Elite Gourmet had the highest temperature variances among the large electric skillets we tested. However, the skillet’s thicker than average cast aluminum pan and large M-shaped heating element prevented the heat distribution from being bad.

Between five points from the center of the pan to the edges, we noted a **13.3% difference** in average temperatures compared to a typical 10%. This number equated to an adequate 7.3/10.

### Making Pancakes

In the background is the Elite Gourmet Non-Stick Electric Skillet EG-6203." width="300px" height="200px">

Heating Time:  2 min 16 sec

Temperature: Medium heat / 350°F

The Elite Gourmet took **2 min 16 sec** to preheat to 350°F, surprisingly faster than any other large skillets and comparable to medium-sized ones (9.7/10). Afterward, with our original recipe ready, we poured **3.17 oz** of batter into the skillet.

To our surprise, the weakness in heat distribution didn’t affect the skillet’s ability to make awesome pancakes. This skillet managed to perfectly cook the pancake in a flash, just **1 min 10 sec** on the first side and **1 min 30 sec** on the flip side. The result was a **golden brown**, **fluffy**, **steamy** pancake with a honeycomb pattern that  can be a sure hit for children.

You may need to adjust the timing as per your recipe, and this 16-inch pan can do 3 to 4 pancakes at a time. We didn’t need to coat the pan with any butter or oil thanks to the non-stick coating. Nonetheless, adding oil to the pan is recommended to prolong the coating’s lifespan.

### Cooking Steaks

Heating Time: 3 min 5 sec

Temperature: High heat / 400°F

To achieve the optimal crust on our **8 oz**, **1.38-inch** top blade steak, we preheated the Elite Gourmet to 400°F. This took only **3 min 5 sec**, which was two whole minutes faster than average for the same size category. Therefore, it received an astounding 8.9/10, comparable to even medium-sized skillets.

We seared both sides for **4 min** each. Since the temperature took a while to stabilize, the second side didn’t take longer than the first as was the case with most other electric skillets.

Interestingly, the skillet power cycled off at around 8 minutes, just as we finished the two sides and were just about to move onto the edges. The fat cap took **1 min 30 sec** to sear and the other edges **1 min** each. Finally, we added rosemary and butter and seared each side for an additional **1 min**.

Our meat probes showed the steak's internal temperature to be **140°F**, which rose to **145°F** after the mandatory 3 minutes of resting. The entire process took just under 16 minutes and resulted in a spot-on medium-rare steak, earning the skillet a near perfect rating of 9.5/10 from our chef.

Though not sizzling hot, the skillet maintained an **exceptionally steady** heat. Therefore, although the crust wasn’t as thick and crispy as the Hamilton Beach’s, the meat was juicier and more tender.

The entire build of the Elite Gourmet Non-Stick Electric Skillet EG-6203# was extremely sturdy. All the design features were of high quality, especially the marble-coated, raised honeycomb pan with an impressive capacity.

### 10 - Pan

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/elite-gourmet-electric-skillet-eg-6203-pan-cltnuvhie003swz88e65g9v1q.jpg" alt="The pan of the Elite Gourmet Non-Stick Electric Skillet EG-6203 is 15.94 inches in length, 12.79 inches in width, and 3.15 inches in depth." width="300px" height="200px">

Cooking Capacity: 11.1 quarts

Dimensions: L15.94 x W12.79 x H3.15 inches

Material: Cast aluminum

Coating: Marble

Handle: Steel

Spout: Yes

Dishwasher-Safe: Yes

The Elite Gourmet skillet has a 0.16" thick (4 mm) cast aluminum pan which is more durable than just non-cast aluminum (+4). The pan’s thickness means that it’s less likely to deform in the presence of heat and maintains heat better.

Usually, the thickness should help with even heating but this pan seemed to be too large so the temperature variances were more severe than others. Even its large M-shaped heating element wasn’t enough to help with this heat distribution problem.

However, we attributed the Elite Gourmet’s fast heating time to its heating element covering a larger surface area than most other skillets having just rectangular ones. The high power output commonly seen in large skillets definitely helped as well.

The pan has a visually striking raised honeycomb pattern. It doesn’t make the coating more susceptible to breaking and peeling, but it’s advisable to refrain from using metal utensils or scrubbers.

The pan has a **marble coating** (comprises resin), or granite coating, which is much more durable than Teflon and doesn’t pose any health concern similar to a ceramic coating (+2). This product adheres to [California’s Proposition 65](https://oehha.ca.gov/proposition-65).

We measured the cooking capacity to be around 11.1 quarts but the usable volume should be 10.5 quart as the label stated. The pan has a spout for pouring liquid, so the lid doesn’t need to have a steam vent to release the pressure (+1).

The handles aren’t detached from the pan but that’s not a problem (+1). Of course, the entire pan is dishwasher-safe (+2).

### 10 - Lid

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/elite-gourmet-electric-skillet-eg-6203-lid-cltnuvhi0003nwz882bgrf41y.jpg" alt="The tempered glass lid of the Elite Gourmet Non-Stick Electric Skillet EG-6203 has a steam vent." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Tempered glass

Handle: Thermosetting plastic

Steam Vent: Yes

Dishwasher-Safe: Yes

The tempered glass lid is dishwasher-safe and features a thermosetting plastic knob handle (+4). In addition, its steam vent effectively alleviates pressure during cooking (+3). Finally, the precisely crafted metal edging seamlessly fits the pan, ensuring a snug and secure fit (+3).

### 7.0 - Base

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/elite-gourmet-electric-skillet-eg-6203-base-cltnuvhi3003owz88gpjb3mkj.jpg" alt="Elite Gourmet Electric Skillet EG 6203 Base" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Steel

Detachable: No

Anti-Slip Pads: Four

Dishwasher-Safe: Yes

You will notice that the metal base has four large stands with anti-slip pads at the bottom. These make sure that such a large and heavy pan remains sturdy (+4). The pan is not detachable so make sure your dishwasher is big enough to fit the entire skillet (+3).

### 8.0 - Thermostat

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/elite-gourmet-electric-skillet-eg-6203-thermostat-cltnuvgy6003gwz8810ko0gb6.jpg" alt="The thermostat of the Elite Gourmet Non-Stick Electric Skillet EG-6203 has 6 settings including Warm-200–250-300-350-400°F." width="300px" height="200px">

Temperature Range: 200–250-300-350-400°F

Detachable: Yes

Indicator Light: Yes

Dishwasher-Safe: No

The detachable thermostat is a conventional design with a working indicator light (+4). Its temperature range is a standard from 200 to 400°F plus a keep warm setting of around 150°F (+1).

In addition to a seamless fit ,the thermostat has a rare release trigger making removal much more effortless (+3). Nonetheless, like most other thermostats, you shouldn’t put it in the dishwasher.

The Elite Gourmet Non-Stick Electric Skillet EG-6203# is extra easy to use thanks to its thermostat having a trigger release. The pan was the easiest to clean out of all of our skillets but it could use a detachable and foldable base like the Presto 06857 for easier storage.

### 9.0 - Ease of Use

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/elite-gourmet-electric-skillet-eg-6203-ease-use-cltnuvhi6003pwz88369eh8mm.jpg" alt="The pan and lid of the Elite Gourmet Non-Stick Electric Skillet EG-6203." width="300px" height="200px">

We found that the thermostat fitted nicely and was extra easy to remove with its trigger release (+2). The temperatures were precise and the indicator light was easy to see as well (+2).

Additionally, the skillet's exterior remained at a safe temperature throughout the cooking process, minimizing the risk of accidental burning (+2). Moreover, the anti-slip pads on the base provided excellent stability, even when we tried bashing it around (+3).

### 9.0 - Cleaning and Storing

During testing, we found that this skillet was the **easiest to clean** of them all to our surprise, even the burnt caramel posed no problem (+2).

 All it needed was a quick hand-wash with warm water and some dishwashing liquid (+2). Or you can just pop everything except for the thermostat in the dishwasher, just make sure there’s enough space for such a large skillet (+2).

The skillet is quite large so you may not want to keep it on your kitchen counter. Luckily, it can fit back in the box just fine (+3).
