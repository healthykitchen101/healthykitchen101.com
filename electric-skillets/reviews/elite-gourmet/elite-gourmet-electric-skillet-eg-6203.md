The Elite Gourmet Non-Stick Electric Skillet EG-6203# measures 16 inches across and holds up to 10.5 quarts. It’s the largest and deepest pan in our line-up capable of frying up chicken for 6 to 8 people.

We found the **marble-coated raised honeycomb** pan aesthetic, functional, and easy to clean. Pancakes cooked perfectly, while steaks were extra tender and juicy with a light crusting. Considering this, and the fastest preheating times of any large skillet, we let pass the somewhat uneven heat distribution.

The **trigger release** on the thermostat was also much appreciated. For a large skillet, the base is neither detachable nor foldable, but at only **$58.70** (at the time of writing), we couldn’t ask for more.

**Things We Like**

*   Raised honeycomb pan
*   Large capacity
*   Fast heating speed
*   Stable temperatures
*   Marble coating
*   High build quality

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Heat distribution

Elite Gourmet, by Maxi-Matic, is a US-based Chinese brand of more than 37 years standing. They manufacture a wide range of small kitchen appliances including toaster ovens, blenders, waffle makers, food dehydrators, deep fryers, steamers, and more.

Being unfamiliar with the marble-coated, raised honeycomb design of the Elite Gourmet Non-Stick Electric Skillet EG-6203#, we were doubly excited to get into the kitchen. During our ‘meet and greet’ we didn’t know what to expect. However, fast-boiling water piqued our interest and fried eggs cleaned off the pan in no time. Join us and see what more this skillet has in store for you!

The Elite Gourmet Non-Stick Electric Skillet EG-6203# was one of the best skillets for making pancakes and searing steaks, plus the heating speed was exceptional. Despite this, the somewhat uneven heat distribution analysis dragged down its performance score.

### Analyzing Heat Distribution

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/elite-gourmet-electric-skillet-eg-6203-analyzing-heat-distribution-cltnuvhil003vwz88af9g7z9c.jpg" alt="5 temperature points on the surface of the Elite Gourmet Non-Stick Electric Skillet EG-6203 are 330°F, 377°F, 385°F, 349°F, and 293°F." width="300px" height="200px">

Temperature: High heat / 400°F

Temperature Differences: 13.3%

To detect the temperature differences across the skillet’s surface, we placed some oil absorbent sheets saturated with sugar water inside. We then heated the pan to 400°F and used an infrared thermometer to check 5 key temperature points.

Since this is the largest and deepest pan we’ve tested, we weren’t surprised by the wide temperature differences. However, the skillet’s **thicker** than average pan and **broad M-shaped element** seemed to largely mitigate these differences while cooking.

Between five points from the center of the pan to the edges, we noted a **13.3% difference** in average temperatures compared to a typical 10%. This number equated to an acceptable score of 7.3/10.

### Making Pancakes

In the background is the Elite Gourmet Non-Stick Electric Skillet EG-6203." width="300px" height="200px">

Heating Time:  2 min 16 sec

Temperature: Medium heat / 350°F

The Elite Gourmet took **2 min 16 sec** to preheat to 350°F. This was surprisingly fast for a large skillet and comparable to even a medium-sized one (9.7/10). With the skillet ready, we poured **3.17 oz** of batter from our original pancake mix into the skillet.

To our surprise, the unevenness in heat distribution did not detract from quality, awesome pancakes. Not only that, they cooked in a flash taking **1 min 10 sec** on the first side and **1 min 30 sec** on the flip side. 

The results were **golden brown** pancakes with a lovely honeycomb pattern, **fluffy and steamy** on the inside—a sure hit with children.

We attributed the faster heating times to the larger surface area covered by the M-shaped elements compared to skillets with simple rectangular ones. The high power draw, commonly seen in large skillets, definitely helped as well.

This 16-inch pan can do 3 to 4 pancakes at a time, and you may need to adjust the cooking time as per your recipe. We didn’t need to grease the pan, but a little butter or oil can prolong the life of the coating.

### Cooking Steaks

Heating Time: 3 min 5 sec

Temperature: High heat / 400°F

We preheated the Elite Gourmet to 400°F to ensure a perfect crusting for our **8 oz**, **1.38-inch** top blade steak. This took only **3 min 5 sec**—a whole two minutes faster on average for a large skillet thus achieving an astounding 8.9/10, similar to a medium-sized skillet.

We seared both sides for **4 min** each. Unlike other skillets, the flipside cooked in equal time because of how fast the temperature stabilized.

Interestingly, the power cycled off at around 8 min just as we were just about to move onto the edges. The fat cap took **1 min 30 sec** to sear and the other edges **1 min** each. Finally, we added rosemary and butter and seared each side for an additional **1 min**.

Our meat probes read an internal temperature of **140°F** and this rose to **145°F** after a standard 3 minutes of resting. It took just under 16 minutes to achieve a spot-on medium-rare steak, earning the skillet a near perfect rating of 9.5/10 from our chef.

Though not sizzling hot, the skillet maintained an **exceptionally steady** heat. Therefore, although the crust wasn’t as thick and crispy as the Hamilton Beach, the meat was juicier and more tender.

Cooking Capacity: 11.1 quarts

Dimensions: L15.94 x W12.79 x H3.15 inches

Material: Cast aluminum

Coating: Marble

Handle: Steel

Spout: Yes

Dishwasher-Safe: Yes

The Elite Gourmet skillet has a thick 0.16-inch (4 mm) **cast aluminum pan** which is more durable than just a non-cast pan (+4). This extra thickness means the pan is unlikely to deform under high heat and should maintain steadier temperatures.

The skillet has a noticeably raised pan with a striking honeycomb pattern. We measured the cooking capacity to be around 11.1 quarts but the usable volume should be 10.5 quart as the label states.

The pan has a spout for pouring liquid as well as fixed handles and base (+1). Nonetheless, the entire unit is dishwasher-safe (+3).

The **marble coating** (aka granite) is made up of resin which is much more durable than Teflon. It also poses less of a [health concern](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/nonstick-cookware-safety), and marble is less likely to chip than a ceramic coating (+2). This non-stick skillet meets the strict non-toxic criteria of [California’s Proposition 65](https://oehha.ca.gov/proposition-65).

### 10 - Lid

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/elite-gourmet-electric-skillet-eg-6203-lid-cltnuvhi0003nwz882bgrf41y.jpg" alt="The tempered glass lid of the Elite Gourmet Non-Stick Electric Skillet EG-6203 has a steam vent." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Tempered glass

Handle: Thermosetting plastic

Steam Vent: Yes

Dishwasher-Safe: Yes

The tempered glass lid is dishwasher-safe and features a thermosetting plastic knob handle (+3). In addition, its steam vent effectively alleviates pressure during cooking (+3). Finally, the precisely crafted metal edging seamlessly fits the pan, ensuring a snug and secure fit (+3).

### 7.0 - Base

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/elite-gourmet-electric-skillet-eg-6203-base-cltnuvhi3003owz88gpjb3mkj.jpg" alt="Elite Gourmet Electric Skillet EG 6203 Base" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Steel

Detachable: No

Anti-Slip Pads: Four

Dishwasher-Safe: Yes

You will notice that the metal base has four large stands with anti-slip pads at the bottom. These make sure that such a large and heavy pan remains sturdy (+4). The pan is not detachable so make sure your dishwasher is big enough to fit the entire skillet (+3).

### 8.0 - Thermostat

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/elite-gourmet-electric-skillet-eg-6203-thermostat-cltnuvgy6003gwz8810ko0gb6.jpg" alt="The thermostat of the Elite Gourmet Non-Stick Electric Skillet EG-6203 has 6 settings including Warm-200–250-300-350-400°F." width="300px" height="200px">

Temperature Range: 200–250-300-350-400°F

Detachable: Yes

Indicator Light: Yes

Dishwasher-Safe: No

The detachable thermostat has a working indicator light (+4). Its temperature range is standard, meaning from 200 to 400°F (+1). There isn’t a Keep Warm setting as such, but it maintained around 150°F by dialing shy of 200°F .

In addition to a seamless fit, the thermostat has a rare release trigger making it all the more easier to remove (+3). Nonetheless, like most other thermostats, you shouldn’t put it in the dishwasher.

The Elite Gourmet Non-Stick Electric Skillet EG-6203# is super easy to use thanks to its thermostat having a trigger release. The non-stick pan was the easiest to clean out of all of our tested skillets. However, it could use a detachable and foldable base like the Presto 06857 for easier storage.

### 9.0 - Ease of Use

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/elite-gourmet-electric-skillet-eg-6203-ease-use-cltnuvhi6003pwz88369eh8mm.jpg" alt="The pan and lid of the Elite Gourmet Non-Stick Electric Skillet EG-6203." width="300px" height="200px">

We found the thermostat fitted nicely and perfectly easy to remove (+2). The temperatures were precise and the indicator light clearly visible (+2).

Additionally, the skillet's exterior remained at a safe temperature throughout the cooking process, minimizing the risk of accidental burning (+2). Moreover, the anti-slip pads on the base provided excellent stability, even when we tried bashing the pan around (+3).

### 9.0 - Cleaning and Storing

During testing, this Elite Gourmet turned out the **easiest skillet to clean** and even burnt caramel just slid right off (+2).

All it needed was a quick hand-wash with warm water and some dishwashing liquid (+2). The skillet can just go in the dishwasher, but it would be better to check the dimensions first (+2).

Although the skillet fits back in its box just fine, with its large size, it may be better to leave it out on the kitchen counter.(+3).
