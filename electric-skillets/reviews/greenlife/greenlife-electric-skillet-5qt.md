The 12-inch GreenLife Ceramic Non-Stick Electric Skillet CC003725-002 is our best pick for a medium-sized skillet (6.1 qt.). Its above par cooking performance and exceptional ceramic coating set it apart, while its medium size contributed to faster preheating compared to the larger skillets.

Priced at around **$42** (at the time of writing), this skillet offers exceptional value despite lacking convenient features such as a detachable pan or fold up base. Its colorful and decorative aesthetic means it can happily stand out on a table or your kitchen countertop.

**Things We Like**

*   Fast heating times
*   Well-rounded cooking performances
*   Ceramic non-stick coating
*   High build quality
*   Light in weight

**Things We Donâ€™t Like**

*   Not suitable for deep-frying

Our first impression of the GreenLife Ceramic Non-Stick Electric Skillet CC003725-002 was a sturdy build with an attractive aesthetic. In the initial testing, fried eggs just slid right off the pan and boiling water took little time. Therefore, this skillet gave rise to some great expectations.
