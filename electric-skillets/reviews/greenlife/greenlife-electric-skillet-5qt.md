The 12-inch GreenLife Ceramic Non-Stick Electric Skillet CC003725-002 is our best pick for a medium-sized skillet (6.1 qt.). Its above par cooking performance and exceptional ceramic coating set it apart, while its medium size contributed to faster preheating compared to the larger skillets.

Priced at around **$42** (at the time of writing), this skillet offers exceptional value despite lacking convenient features such as a detachable pan or fold up base. Its colorful and decorative aesthetic means it can happily stand out on a table or your kitchen countertop.

**Things We Like**

*   Fast heating times
*   Well-rounded cooking performances
*   Ceramic non-stick coating
*   High build quality
*   Light in weight

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Not suitable for deep-frying

Our first impression of the GreenLife Ceramic Non-Stick Electric Skillet CC003725-002 was a sturdy build with an attractive aesthetic. In the initial testing, fried eggs just slid right off the pan and boiling water took little time. Therefore, this skillet gave rise to some great expectations.

The GreenLife Ceramic Non-Stick Electric Skillet CC003725-002 showed the most well-rounded performance among the medium-sized electric skillets we tested. The scores for heat distribution, making pancakes and searing steaks, while not the highest, were consistently good.

### Analyzing Heat Distribution

Temperature: High heat / 400°F

Temperature Differences: 11.85%

The GreenLife didn’t have the most evenly distributed heat, but it wasn’t bad by comparison. This is quite common for medium-sized skillets with a **square pan** but **circular heating element** causing the edges to have noticeably lower temperatures.

To gauge temperature differences across the skillet's surface, we placed a saturated sugar water-soaked oil absorbent sheet in it. Then, we heated the pan to 400°F and used an infrared thermometer to measure 5 key points.

Our findings revealed an average temperature variance of **11.85%** compared to a 10% standard average. This scored a 7.6/10 in our rating system, which fell slightly short of the same-sized Crux and the Bella electric skillets.

### Making Pancakes

Heating Time: 1 min 58 sec

Temperature: Medium heat / 350°F

The GreenLife took **1 min 58 sec** to preheat to 350°F, which was worthy of a perfect 10/10. Despite a lower power draw, this was also significantly faster than any of the large skillets.

With our customized pancake batter ready, it took just 1 min topside and 2 min 30 sec on the flip side to cook a  **3.17 oz pancake**. The surface texture was an even color but only slightly firm and a little fluffy on the inside. This scored an 8/10, but better nonetheless than any other medium-sized skillet.

We only cooked one pancake at a time, but this 12-inch pan can easily fit two to three at a time. You may need to adjust the time depending on your pancake mix.

GreenLife’s reputable and excellent non-stick coating needed no greasing at all. However, it's advisable to brush on a thin layer of oil to extend the pan’s longevity.
