The 16-inch Presto Foldaway Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06857 is an excellent addition to your kitchen without breaking the bank at $77.4. It comes in second in our curated line-up of 9, only losing to our champion.

Its thick cast aluminum pan and large M-shaped heating element resulted in an average of only 5.7% in temperature differences on the surface. We were able to make some perfectly fluffy and steamy pancakes as well as some excellent tender and juicy steak.

The PFOA-free Teflon non-stick coating, both inside and outside, allowed us to test making pancakes without the need to add any butter or oil. Although it would be a lot more reassuring if the non-stick coating was ceramic instead of Teflon.

On that note, we only needed to do a quick hand-washing after all the cooking. With the foldaway feature, you can always detach the base and also fit it in the pan for easy and compact storing.

**Things We Like**

**Things We Donâ€™t Like**

Our first impression of the Presto Foldaway Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06857 was a nice, thick pan and a sturdy base. Initial testing showed us that frying eggs left nothing sticking to the pan but the skillet seemed to be on the slower side when boiling water.
