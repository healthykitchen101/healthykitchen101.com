The 16-inch Presto Foldaway Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06857 is an excellent addition to your kitchen without breaking the bank at $77.4. It comes in second in our curated line-up of 9, only losing to our champion.

Its thick cast aluminum pan and large M-shaped heating element resulted in an average of only 5.7% in temperature differences on the surface. We were able to make some perfectly fluffy and steamy pancakes as well as some excellent tender and juicy steak.

The PFOA-free Teflon non-stick coating, both inside and outside, allowed us to test making pancakes without the need to add any butter or oil. Although it would be a lot more reassuring if the non-stick coating was ceramic instead of Teflon.

On that note, we only needed to do a quick hand-washing after all the cooking. With the foldaway feature, you can always detach the base and also fit it in the pan for easy and compact storing.

**Things We Like**

**Things We Don’t Like**

Our first impression of the Presto Foldaway Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06857 was a nice, thick pan and a sturdy base. Initial testing showed us that frying eggs left nothing sticking to the pan but the skillet seemed to be on the slower side when boiling water.

The Presto Foldaway Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06857 is top-tier in terms of heat distributing evenness, how hot it gets, and temperature stability among our tested units. This translates to some excellent pancakes and steaks.

### Analyzing Heat Distribution

Temperature: High heat / 400°F

Temperature Differences: 5.7%

The Presto has a **top-tier** even heat distribution among our tested electric skillets thanks to the skillet’s thick cast aluminum pan and large M-shaped heating element.

To check the temperature difference between different areas on the skillet’s surface, we used an oil absorbent sheet of saturated sugar water and laid it on top. We then heated up the pan to 400°F and used an infrared thermometer to check the temperatures.

Between 5 points from the center of the pan of the edges, we noted an average of **5.7%** in temperature differences. This number equated to an impressive 8.9/10 according to our data, only slightly lower than the much smaller Nesco.

### Making Pancakes

Heating Time: 3 min 50 sec

Temperature: Medium heat / 350°F

The Presto took **3 min 50 sec** to preheat to 350°F, which was quite fast for such a large skillet, 8.2/10. With our homemade pancake batter ready, it only took four and a half minutes for us to have a **3.17 oz pancake** that was **perfectly steamy and fluffy** with a beautiful golden brown color, worthy of a near perfect 9.5/10.

We achieved the best possible pancake on this skillet by cooking the top for **1 min 30 sec** and the bottom for double the amount of time. However, you may need to adjust the time depending on your pancake mix. For the sake of testing, we made one pancake each time but this 16-inch pan can fit 3 or 4 at a time no problem.

We didn’t need to coat the pan with any butter or oil thanks to the non-stick coating. Nonetheless, adding oil to the pan is recommended to prolong its lifespan.

### Cooking Steaks

Heating Time: 4 min

Temperature: High heat / 400°F

To make sure our **8 oz**, **1.38-inch top blade steak** had the best crust possible, we first needed to preheat the Presto to 400°F. This took **6 minutes** which was quite slow even considering the large surface area, so we had to score it 6/10.

After seasoning the steak and inserting a meat thermometer to the center of it, we seared both the first side and the second side for **4 minutes** each. We then give the edge with the fat cap 2 minutes and the other edges 1 min 30 sec each. Finally, we added some fresh rosemary and butter and gave each side 2 more minutes.

The cooking process raised the steak’s internal temperature to **135°F** which increased to **142°F** after the compulsory 3 minutes of resting the meat. This hit the sweet spot for an **excellent medium-rare** steak that was **tender** and **juicy**. The entire process took around 19 minutes.

The skillet’s heat was **stable** but not as high as 500°F like some other skillets, so the crust wasn’t the thickest or crispiest. Nonetheless, it was good enough to earn a 9/10 from our chef, only losing to the steak by the Hamilton Beach 38529K.

The Presto Foldaway Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06857 has 16 inches of great build quality which highlights its detachable base and fold-down handles. The thick pan is ideal for heat distribution, if only the non-stick coating was ceramic instead of Teflon and if the lid’s metal edging fitted the pan better.

### 9.0 - Pan

Cooking Capacity: 7 quart

Dimensions: L15.71" x W11.77" x H2.79"

Material: Cast aluminum

Coating: Teflon

Handle: Thermosetting plastic

Spout: Yes

Dishwasher-Safe: Yes

The Presto skillet has a 0.12" thick cast aluminum pan which is more durable than just non-cast aluminum (+4). The pan’s thickness means that it’s less likely to deform in the presence of heat and also heats up more evenly. Also, the surface is textured similarly to a cast iron skillet, although we’re not sure how much that helps with the cooking of food.

The pan has a spout for pouring liquid, so the lid doesn’t need to have a steam vent to release the pressure (+1). The handles are part of the base which can be completely detached from the pan (+1). At the bottom of the detached pan are four stands so that you can directly serve it on the table.

The non-stick coating is Teflon which is cheaper than ceramic coating and raises some health concerns although most modern Teflon products are free of PFOA (+1). Nonetheless, the pan is dishwasher-safe (+2).

### 7.0 - Lid

Material: Tempered glass

Handle: Steel

Steam Vent: No

Dishwasher-Safe: Yes

The tempered glass lid is dishwasher-safe and has a steel handle and no steam vent (+6). It has metal edging which is common but it doesn’t fit the pan as tightly as some other skillets we’ve seen (+1).

### 9.0 - Base

Material: Thermosetting plastic

Detachable: Yes

Anti-Slip Pads: Four

Dishwasher-Safe: Yes

The detachable base with foldable handles is the best feature of the Presto (+4). Simply press the locking clips on the handles to release the pan and you can lift it up.

The base is made of thermosetting plastic which isn’t as durable as metal but much lighter (+1). It has four anti-slip pads at the bottom and is dishwasher-safe (+4).

### 7.0 - Thermostat

Temperature Range: Warm-200–250-300-350-400°F

Detachable: Yes

Indicator Light: Yes

Dishwasher-Safe: No

The detachable thermostat has a common design and temperature range (from 200 to 400°F) (+3). Keep in mind that the warm setting is around 150°F and not maintaining the current temperature like some other skillets.

The thermostat fits the socket nicely, making it easy to remove afterward (+2). It has an indicator light and isn’t dishwasher-safe (+2).
