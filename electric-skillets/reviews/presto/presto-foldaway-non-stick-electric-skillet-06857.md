The 16-inch Presto Foldaway Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06857 is an excellent addition to your kitchen without breaking the bank at $77.4. It comes in second in our curated line-up of 9, only losing to our champion.

Its thick cast aluminum pan and large M-shaped heating element resulted in an average of only 5.7% in temperature differences on the surface. We were able to make some perfectly fluffy and steamy pancakes as well as some excellent tender and juicy steak.

The PFOA-free Teflon non-stick coating, both inside and outside, allowed us to test making pancakes without the need to add any butter or oil. Although it would be a lot more reassuring if the non-stick coating was ceramic instead of Teflon.

On that note, we only needed to do a quick hand-washing after all the cooking. With the foldaway feature, you can always detach the base and also fit it in the pan for easy and compact storing.

**Things We Like**

**Things We Don’t Like**

Our first impression of the Presto Foldaway Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06857 was a nice, thick pan and a sturdy base. Initial testing showed us that frying eggs left nothing sticking to the pan but the skillet seemed to be on the slower side when boiling water.

The Presto Foldaway Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06857 is top-tier in terms of heat distributing evenness, how hot it gets, and temperature stability among our tested units. This translates to some excellent pancakes and steaks.

### Analyzing Heat Distribution

Temperature: High heat / 400°F

Temperature Differences: 5.7%

The Presto has a **top-tier** even heat distribution among our tested electric skillets thanks to the skillet’s thick cast aluminum pan and large M-shaped heating element.

To check the temperature difference between different areas on the skillet’s surface, we used an oil absorbent sheet of saturated sugar water and laid it on top. We then heated up the pan to 400°F and used an infrared thermometer to check the temperatures.

Between 5 points from the center of the pan of the edges, we noted an average of **5.7%** in temperature differences. This number equated to an impressive 8.9/10 according to our data, only slightly lower than the much smaller Nesco.

### Making Pancakes

Heating Time: 3 min 50 sec

Temperature: Medium heat / 350°F

The Presto took **3 min 50 sec** to preheat to 350°F, which was quite fast for such a large skillet, 8.2/10. With our homemade pancake batter ready, it only took four and a half minutes for us to have a **3.17 oz pancake** that was **perfectly steamy and fluffy** with a beautiful golden brown color, worthy of a near perfect 9.5/10.

We achieved the best possible pancake on this skillet by cooking the top for **1 min 30 sec** and the bottom for double the amount of time. However, you may need to adjust the time depending on your pancake mix. For the sake of testing, we made one pancake each time but this 16-inch pan can fit 3 or 4 at a time no problem.

We didn’t need to coat the pan with any butter or oil thanks to the non-stick coating. Nonetheless, adding oil to the pan is recommended to prolong its lifespan.
