The Presto Foldaway Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06857, selling for **$77.40** (at the time of writing), is an excellent addition to any kitchen without breaking the bank. It ranked as a close runner-up to our best rated electric skillet and is one of the **most user-friendly** skillets we have tested.

The thicker than average pan and sizable rectangular heating element showed the **best even heat distribution** for a large skillet. Its pancakes were **perfect** and only the Hamilton managed a better crust on steak searing.

The non-stick surface, although not a ceramic coating, is a **PFOA-free** Teflon and cooking pancakes required no additional greasing with just a quick hand wash afterward. Plus, the **foldable base** and **detachable pan** made storing a dream.

**Things We Like**

*   Great heat distribution
*   Stable temperatures
*   Sizzling hot searing
*   Foldaway convenience
*   High build quality

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Teflon non-stick coating
*   Lid not the best fit

Our first impression of the Presto Foldaway Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06857 was of a lovely thick pan and a sturdy base. Our out-the-box test had fried eggs leaving nothing stuck to the pan. However, it seemed a bit on the slow side when boiling water.

National Presto Industries, Inc., founded in 1905, is a US small electric appliance manufacturer. Their range of products include vacuum sealers, knife sharpeners, pizza ovens, air fryers, pressure cookers, waffle makers, and electric skillets.

The Presto Foldaway Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06857 is top-tier in terms of even heat distribution, maximum temperature, and temperature stability. This translated into some scrumptious pancakes and juicy steaks for our testing crew.

### Analyzing Heat Distribution

The dark rectangle indicates where the heating element is." width="300px" height="200px">

Temperature: High heat / 400°F

Temperature Differences: 5.7%

The Presto had superbly even heat distribution outdoing most other skillets we tested. We put this down to its thicker than average cast aluminum pan and large rectangular heating element.

To detect the temperature differences across the skillet’s surface, we placed an oil absorbent sheet of saturated sugar water on top. We then heated the pan to 400°F and used an infrared thermometer to check key temperature points.

Between five points from the center of the pan to the edges, we noted a **5.7% difference** in average temperatures. This number equated to an impressive 8.9/10 which was only slightly lower than the much smaller Nesco.

### Making Pancakes

In the background is the Presto Foldaway Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06857." width="300px" height="200px">

Heating Time: 3 min 50 sec

Temperature: Medium heat / 350°F

The Presto took **3 min 50 sec** to preheat to 350°F, which was quite fast for such a large skillet (8.2/10). With our original electric skillet pancake batter ready, it only took 4 min 30 sec to cook a **3.17 oz pancake** to a golden brown hue with a **perfectly steamy** and **fluffy** inside (9.5/10).

This skillet managed a **perfect cooking time** with 1 min 30 sec on the first side and double the time on the flip side. You may need to adjust the timing as per your recipe, and this 16-inch pan can do 3 to 4 pancakes at a time. 

We didn’t need to coat the pan with any butter or oil thanks to the non-stick coating. Nonetheless, adding oil to the pan is recommended to prolong the coating’s lifespan.

### Cooking Steaks

Heating Time: 4 min

Temperature: High heat / 400°F

To make sure our **8 oz**, **1.38-inch top blade steak** had the best crust possible, we first needed to preheat the Presto to 400°F. This took **6 min** which was quite slow even for a large skillet, so we had to score it 6/10.

After seasoning the steak and inserting a meat thermometer, we seared both sides for **4 min**. We then gave the edge with the fat cap 2 min and the other edges 1 min 30 sec each. Finally, we added some fresh rosemary and butter and seared each side for an additional 2 min.

The cooking process raised the steak’s internal temperature to **135°F** which increased to **142°F** after a standard 3 minute resting time. This hit the sweet spot for an **excellent medium-rare** steak that was both **tender** and **juicy**. The entire process took around 19 minutes.

The skillet’s heat was **stable** but didn’t reach 500°F like some other skillets, so the crust wasn’t the thickest nor the crispiest. Nonetheless, it was good enough to earn a 9/10 from our chef. Only the Hamilton Beach 38529K scored higher for its crispier crust.

The Presto Foldaway Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06857 has 16 inches of great build quality. We loved the detachable base and fold-down handles. The thick pan spoke well to even heat distribution, but the metal edging of the lid was not the best fit. Additionally, we would have preferred a ceramic coating to the Teflon.

### 9.0 - Pan

Cooking Capacity:  8.9 quarts

Dimensions: L15.71 x W11.77 x H2.79 inches

Material: Cast aluminum

Coating: Teflon

Handle: Thermosetting plastic

Spout: Yes

Dishwasher-Safe: Yes

The Presto skillet has a 0.12-inch thick cast aluminum pan which is more durable than just non-cast aluminum (+4). The pan’s extra thickness means more even heat distribution and less likelihood of the pan deforming under heat. Also, the surface is textured similarly to a cast iron skillet, although we’re not sure how much that helps with the cooking of food.

The 8.9-quart pan has a spout for pouring liquid which also acts as a steam or pressure vent which the lid doesn’t have (+1). The handles are part of the base which detaches completely from the pan (+1). At the bottom of the detached pan are four stands so that you can serve directly from the table.

The non-stick coating is Teflon. Although cheaper than ceramic coating, some people may see [health concerns](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/nonstick-cookware-safety) despite modern Teflon being free of PFOA (+1). Nonetheless, the pan is dishwasher-safe (+2).

### 7.0 - Lid

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/presto-foldaway-electric-skillet-06857-lid-clti2zxj2002dwz882pk18ln2.jpg" alt="The tempered glass lid of the Presto Foldaway Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06857." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Tempered glass

Handle: Steel

Steam Vent: No

Dishwasher-Safe: Yes

The tempered glass lid is dishwasher-safe (+4). It has a steel handle but no steam vent since the pan has a pouring spout (+2). It has metal edging which is common enough, but it doesn’t fit the pan as tightly as some other skillets we’ve seen (+1).

### 9.0 - Base

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/presto-foldaway-electric-skillet-06857-base-clti2zy0h002hwz88hq4u2f5n.jpg" alt="The detached base of the Presto Foldaway Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06857." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Thermosetting plastic

Detachable: Yes

Anti-Slip Pads: Four

Dishwasher-Safe: Yes

The detachable base with foldable handles is the best feature of the Presto (+4). You simply press the clips on the handles to release the pan and lift it up.

The base is made of thermosetting plastic which isn’t as durable as metal, but much lighter (+1). It has four anti-slip pads at the bottom and is dishwasher-safe (+4).

### 7.0 - Thermostat

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/presto-foldaway-electric-skillet-06857-thermostat-clti2zyhk002nwz885mia2fnb.jpg" alt="The thermostat of the Presto Foldaway Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06857 has 6 settings including Warm-200–250-300-350-400°F." width="300px" height="200px">

Temperature Range: Warm-200–250-300-350-400°F

Detachable: Yes

Indicator Light: Yes

Dishwasher-Safe: No

The detachable thermostat is pretty standard with a temperature range of 200 to 400°F (+3). The warm setting is around 150°F and does not maintain the set temperature like some other skillets.The thermostat fits the socket nicely, making it easy to remove (+2). It has an indicator light and isn’t dishwasher-safe (+2).

The foldaway feature of the Presto 06857 makes it one of the easiest skillets to clean and store. Additionally, we found the rigid base and the sheer weight of the skillet to be very sturdy while cooking.

### 9.5 - Ease of Use

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/presto-foldaway-electric-skillet-06857-ease-use-clti2zyhg002lwz88at0wgy0x.jpg" alt="The base of Presto Foldaway Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06857 clips off and the pan can be lifted up." width="300px" height="200px">

It is always a great start when the thermostat fits nicely and the temperatures are precise (+3). However, the indicator light is below the surface of the thermostat so it can be slightly difficult to see under bright lighting.

The skillet’s exterior never gets hot in a way to risk burning yourself (+3). However, you shouldn’t carry a hot pan without it being attached to the base. Make sure you grip the handles well and be careful not to accidentally trigger the safety clips.

While cooking or stirring vigorously you don’t have to worry about the pan moving because the perfectly flat base has very sturdy anti-slip pads (+3). We did feel the lid to be slightly heavy, but easily manageable nonetheless.

### 9.5 - Cleaning and Storing

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/presto-foldaway-electric-skillet-06857-cleaning-storing-clti2zxtw002fwz887ltx6049.jpg" alt="With handles folded in, the base of the Presto Foldaway Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06857 fits into the pan." width="300px" height="200px">

As one can expect from a good non-stick pan, the food released easily and all that was required was a quick, mild-soapy hand wash (+6). Also, grease from the nooks and crannies along the textured surface cleaned out nicely too.

The coolest feature is how the base handles fold in and then the entire removable base just fits inside the pan —making storing quick and easy (+3).
