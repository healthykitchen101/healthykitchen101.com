The 16-inch Presto Electric Skillet 06852 could have made the list if not for our top two contenders taking up the spots for large skillets. Priced **$63** (at the time of writing), it doesn’t have fancy design features but that didn’t affect its user-friendliness.

It had equally good maximum temperature retention as [our runner up](https://healthykitchen101.com/electric-skillets/reviews/best/)—the Presto Foldaway 06857. Overall, the **temperature stability** was better while the heat distribution was only marginally less even. This translated to a **faster steak searing** time but slightly less even coloration on the pancakes.

While we would have preferred a ceramic coating, the PFOA-free Teflon non-stick surface reduced the need for oil or grease and was super-easy to clean. However, the main usability issue for this pan was the lack of anti-slip pads—something quite unusual. We found the pan moved around too much when cooking.

**Things We Like**

*   Great heat distribution
*   Stable temperatures
*   Sizzling hot searing
*   High build quality

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Teflon non-stick coating
*   Lid not the best fit
*   No anti-slip pads

National Presto Industries, Inc. has been a manufacturer of small kitchen appliances in the United States since 1905. They also make vacuum sealers, knife sharpeners, pizza ovens, air fryers, pressure cookers, and waffle makers.

We put the PrestoNon-Stick Electric Skillet 06852 through its paces alongside the Foldaway 06857. Our standard test run of frying eggs and boiling water yielded similar results. Therefore, we were eager for a faceoff in terms of performance, design, and ease of use.

The Presto Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06852 stands out for its stable temperature , relatively good heat distribution, and high maximum temperature. In our test sessions, these all resulted in delicious pancakes and succulent steaks—comparable to the [Presto 06857](https://healthykitchen101.com/electric-skillets/reviews/presto/presto-foldaway-electric-skillet-06857/) with a folding base.

### Analyzing Heat Distribution

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/presto-electric-skillet-06852-analyzing-heat-distribution-clu2c36tq000ttf888sfe4qbz.jpg" alt="The Presto Electric Skillet 06852 with a white oil-absorbent sheet covering the surface of the pan. The dark rectangle indicates where the heating element is." width="300px" height="200px">

Temperature: High heat / 400°F

Temperature Differences: 5.8%

The Presto 06852 skillet showcased exceptional heat distribution, surpassing the majority of other skillets in our test-lineup. This superior performance is largely due to its thicker-than-average cast aluminum pan and sizable rectangular heating element.

In our testing process, we used oil absorbent sheets saturated with sugar water to detect temperature variances across the skillet's surface. After heating the pan to 400°F, we measured key temperature points using an infrared thermometer.

Across five designated points spanning from the pan's center to its edges, we observed a mere **5.8% temperature variance** on average. This was only one decimal point lower than the Presto 06857 (5.7%)—a remarkable consistency and worthy of a commendable rating of 8.8/10.

### Making Pancakes

In the background is the Presto Electric Skillet 06852." width="300px" height="200px">

Heating Time: 3 min 44 sec

Temperature: Medium heat / 350°

The Presto skillet preheated to 350°F in just **3 min 44 sec**, or 6 sec faster than the foldable Presto 06857. This was quite fast for its large size scoring 8.3/10.

Using our original electric skillet pancake batter, it cooked a **3.17 oz pancake** to perfection in a mere 4 min and 30 sec—exactly the same as the Presto 06857. The result was a delightfully steamy and fluffy interior. The golden brown hue, however, was not as good as its rival which had a competitively better rating of 9/10.

This skillet achieved a perfect cooking time with **1 min 30 sec** on the first side and double that on the flip side. Both Prestos have a 16-inch-, pan that can make 3 to 4 pancakes at a time. Depending on your recipe, you may need to adjust cooking times.

Thanks to its non-stick coating, no butter or oil was needed but adding a little can prolong the coating's lifespan.

### Cooking Steaks

Heating Time: 5 min 20 sec

Temperature: High heat / 400°F

To make sure our **8 oz**, **1.38-inch top blade steak** had the best crust possible, we first preheated the Presto to 400°F. This took **5 min** **20 sec** which, although a full 40 sec faster than its faceoff partner, was slow for a large skillet and scored only 6.7/10.

After seasoning the steak and inserting a meat thermometer, we seared both sides for **4 min**. We then gave the long edge with the fat cap 2 min, the other long edge for 1 min 30 sec, and the shorter edge for 1 min. Finally, we added some fresh rosemary and butter and seared the first side for 30 sec and the flip side 1 min more.

The cooking process raised the steak’s internal temperature to **133°F** which increased to **140°F** after a standard 3 minute resting time. This hit the sweet spot for an **excellent medium-rare** steak that was both **tender** and **juicy**.

Interestingly, the entire process took around 17 minutes which was **2 minutes shorter** than the Presto 06857—but their results were similar. Therefore, our chef gave the steak the same high score of 9/10.

We assumed a more stable heat resulted in a shorter cooking time due to this basic Presto having a 1‒mm thicker pan. Nonetheless, this skillet wasn’t as hot as the [Hamilton Beach 38529K](https://healthykitchen101.com/electric-skillets/reviews/hamilton-beach/hamilton-beach-electric-skillet-38529k/) for that crispier crust.

The Presto Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06852 has an extra-thick, durable pan with a cast iron patterning. However, we felt even such a heavy pan should have anti-slip pads on the bottom. It also shared the same problem of an ill-fitting lid as the fancier 06857 model.

### In the Box

Length: 22.4" (57.0 cm)

Width: 12.1" (30.6 cm)

Height: 8.1" (20.5 cm)

Weight: 7.8 lbs (3.6 kg)

Our hand measurements matched well to the manufacturer’s 23" x 13" x 9" and 9 pounds in weight.

### 9.0 - Pan

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/presto-electric-skillet-06852-pan-clu2c33lh000ktf884dia3cm2.jpg" alt="The pan of the Presto Electric Skillet 06852 is 15.71 inches in length, 11.73 inches in width, and 2.79 inches in depth." width="300px" height="200px">

Cooking Capacity: 8.9 qt.

Dimensions: L15.71 x W11.73 x H2.79 inches

Material: Cast aluminum

Coating: Teflon

Handle: Thermosetting plastic

Spout: No

Dishwasher-Safe: Yes

The Presto 06852 skillet boasts a 0.16-inch (4 mm) thick **cast aluminum pan** which is 1 mm thicker than the average 3 mm of the Presto 06857 (+4). The added thickness of the pan promotes more even heat distribution and reduces the likelihood of deformation under heat.

Our hand-measured capacity of the pan is 8.9 quarts, with an estimated usable volume of around 8 quarts (+1). The handles are fixed to the pan as part of the base bracket and there is no pouring spout (+1). The complete unit, except for the thermostat, can go into the dishwasher (+2). 

The surface of the pan is textured similarly to a cast iron skillet, enhancing its visual appeal. However, its impact on cooking performance remains uncertain to us.

Similar to the foldable Presco we reviewed, the non-stick coating of the pan is Teflon which is typically more budget-friendly than ceramic coating (+1). However, some people may have [health concerns](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/nonstick-cookware-safety) around Teflon, despite the modern formulation being free of PFOA.

### 8.0 - Lid

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/presto-electric-skillet-06852-lid-clu2c348x000ntf884k1beht5.jpg" alt="The tempered glass lid of the Presto Electric Skillet 06852 has a steam vent." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Tempered glass

Handle: Steel

Steam Vent: Yes

Dishwasher-Safe: Yes

The tempered glass lid is dishwasher-safe (+4). It has a steel handle but no steam vent to relieve pressure build-up during cooking (+2).

Moreover, the metal edging (+1), while common, does not fit the pan as tightly as observed in some other skillets. This may unintentionally relieve said pressure but we thought it should still count as a manufacturing flaw.

### 4.0 - Base

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/presto-electric-skillet-06852-base-clu2c36hr000rtf8863ds09hw.jpg" alt="The base of the Presto Electric Skillet 06852 has four stands." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Thermosetting plastic

Detachable: No

Anti-Slip Pads: No

Dishwasher-Safe: Yes

The Presto 06852 has two screw-on thermosetting plastic handles that form part of the base bracket and similar to most other skillets (+2). The entire unit can go in the dishwasher (+2). As mentioned, there are no anti-slip pads on the base stands for an extra-tight grip to the surface (+0).

### 7.0 - Thermostat

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/presto-electric-skillet-06852-thermostat-clu2c3054000htf88h9oo6w3n.jpg" alt="The thermostat of the Presto Electric Skillet 06852 has 6 settings including Warm-200–250-300-350-400°F." width="300px" height="200px">

Temperature Range: Warm-200–250-300-350-400°F

Detachable: Yes

Indicator Light: Yes

Dishwasher-Safe: No

The detachable thermostat features a standard temperature range of 200 to 400°F (+3). Meanwhile, the warm setting, which is approximately 150°F, does not maintain the set temperature like some other skillets. This is the same as the Presto 06857.

The thermostat fits the socket nicely and is easy to remove (+2). Similar to most other skillets, the thermostat has an indicator light and is not dishwasher-safe (+2).

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/presto-electric-skillet-06852-power-cord-clu2c321w000itf88focrfytr.jpg" alt="The flat two-prong power cord of the Presto Electric Skillet 06852 is 31.1 inches long." width="300px" height="200px">

Type: Two-prong

Length: 31.1" (79.0 cm)

Power: 1500 W

Rated Output: 120 V ~ 60 Hz

The power cord is exactly the same as the Presto 06857 with a flat design and measures 31.1 inches in length. While slightly shorter than preferred, this is adequate for cooking on a kitchen counter. It has a two-prong plug, which is generally perceived as less safe than a grounded three-prong plug.

The Presto Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06852 doesn’t have ultra-convenient detachable and foldable handles like the Presto 06857 but it’s just as easy to use, clean, and store away. The main usability issue was no anti-slip pads so the pan was prone to moving around.

### 5.0 - Ease of Use

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/presto-electric-skillet-06852-ease-use-clu2c33lp000ltf8817lu0nlg.jpg" alt="The Presto Electric Skillet 06852 with its thermostat inserted." width="300px" height="200px">

We found that the thermostat was a nice fit and the temperatures stabilized well (+2). Also, the skillet's exterior maintained a safe temperature, so there’s no risk of accidental burning (+3). 

However, both Prestos were similar in that their indicator light is sunken and somewhat difficult to see under bright lighting. Also, this basic Presto has no anti-slip pads on the base and we had some incidences of the skillet moving around while cooking.

### 9.0 - Cleaning and Storing

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/presto-electric-skillet-06852-cleaning-storing-clu2c35k5000ptf88ady98ev9.jpg" alt="Burnt caramel on the surface of the Presto Electric Skillet 06852." width="300px" height="200px">

Similar to the foldable Presto 06857, food was effortlessly released from the high-quality non-stick pan. It only needed a quick, mild-soapy hand wash (+4). Likewise, grease in nooks and crannies along the textured surface cleaned out easily (+1).

Although the base doesn’t clip off like the Presto 06857, the screw-on handles are easy to take off if you have a screwdriver handy. In this way, you can separate the base if needs be for storage or if your dishwasher is not big enough to fit the entire unit (+4).
