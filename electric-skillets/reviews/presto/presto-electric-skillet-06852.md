The 16-inch Presto Electric Skillet 06852 could have made the list if not for our top two contenders taking up the spots for large skillets. Priced **$63** (at the time of writing), it doesn’t have fancy design features but that didn’t affect its user-friendliness.

It had equally good maximum temperature retention as [our runner up](https://healthykitchen101.com/electric-skillets/reviews/best/)—the Presto Foldaway 06857. Overall, the **temperature stability** was better while the heat distribution was only marginally less even. This translated to a **faster steak searing** time but slightly less even coloration on the pancakes.

While we would have preferred a ceramic coating, the PFOA-free Teflon non-stick surface reduced the need for oil or grease and was super-easy to clean. However, the main usability issue for this pan was the lack of anti-slip pads—something quite unusual. We found the pan moved around too much when cooking.

**Things We Like**

*   Great heat distribution
*   Stable temperatures
*   Sizzling hot searing
*   High build quality

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Teflon non-stick coating
*   Lid not the best fit
*   No anti-slip pads

National Presto Industries, Inc. has been a manufacturer of small kitchen appliances in the United States since 1905. They also make vacuum sealers, knife sharpeners, pizza ovens, air fryers, pressure cookers, and waffle makers.

We put the PrestoNon-Stick Electric Skillet 06852 through its paces alongside the Foldaway 06857. Our standard test run of frying eggs and boiling water yielded similar results. Therefore, we were eager for a faceoff in terms of performance, design, and ease of use.

The Presto Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06852 stands out for its stable temperature , relatively good heat distribution, and high maximum temperature. In our test sessions, these all resulted in delicious pancakes and succulent steaks—comparable to the Presto 06857 with a folding base.

### Analyzing Heat Distribution

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/presto-electric-skillet-06852-analyzing-heat-distribution-clu2c36tq000ttf888sfe4qbz.jpg" alt="The Presto Electric Skillet 06852 with a white oil-absorbent sheet covering the surface of the pan. The dark rectangle indicates where the heating element is." width="300px" height="200px">

Temperature: High heat / 400°F

Temperature Differences: 5.8%

The Presto skillet showcased exceptional heat distribution, surpassing the majority of other skillets in our testing lineup. This superior performance can be attributed to its thicker-than-average cast aluminum pan and sizable rectangular heating element.

In our testing process, we used oil absorbent sheets saturated with sugar water to detect temperature variances across the skillet's surface. After heating the pan to 400°F, we measured key temperature points using an infrared thermometer.

Across five designated points spanning from the pan's center to its edges, we observed a mere **5.8% difference** in average temperatures. This remarkable consistency earned the skillet a commendable rating of 8.8/10, literally one decimal point lower than the Presto 06857.

### Making Pancakes

In the background is the Presto Electric Skillet 06852." width="300px" height="200px">

Heating Time: 3 min 44 sec

Temperature: Medium heat / 350°

The Presto skillet preheated to 350°F in just **3 min 44 sec**, quite fast for its substantial size, earning it a rating of 8.3/10.

Using our original electric skillet pancake batter, it cooked a **3.17 oz pancake** to perfection in a mere 4 min and 30 sec. The result was in a delightfully steamy and fluffy interior, although with a slightly less even golden brown hue compared to its counterpart, the Presto 06857 which had a competitively better garnering a rating of 9/10.

This skillet achieved an optimal cooking time with **1 min 30 sec** on the first side and double the time on the flip side. And with its 16-inch size, the pan can accommodate 3 to 4 pancakes simultaneously. Depending on your recipe, adjustments may be necessary.

Thanks to its non-stick coating, butter or oil was unnecessary, although adding oil is recommended to prolong the coating's lifespan.

### Cooking Steaks

Heating Time: 5 min 20 sec

Temperature: High heat / 400°F

To make sure our **8 oz**, **1.38-inch top blade steak** had the best crust possible, we first needed to preheat the Presto to 400°F. This took **5 min** **20 sec** which was quite slow even for a large skillet, so we had to score it 6.7/10.

After seasoning the steak and inserting a meat thermometer, we seared both sides for **4 min**. We then gave the long edge with the fat cap 2 min, the other long edge for 1 min 30 sec, and the shorter edge for 1 min. Finally, we added some fresh rosemary and butter  and seared the first side for 30 sec and the flip side 1 min more.

The cooking process raised the steak’s internal temperature to **133°F** which increased to **140°F** after a standard 3 minute resting time. This hit the sweet spot for an **excellent medium-rare** steak that was both **tender** and **juicy**.

Interestingly, the entire process took around 17 minutes which was 2 minutes shorter than the Presto 06857 but their results were similar. Therefore, our chef gave the steak the same high score of 9/10.

We assumed the shorter cooking time was due to a more stable heat from the Presto 06852’s 1-mm thicker pan. Nonetheless, the skillet wasn’t as hot as the Hamilton Beach 38529K for that crispier crust.

The Presto Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06852 has a thick, durable pan with a cast iron pattern. However, we felt such a heavy pan would require anti-slip pads on the bottom to keep it in place. It also shared the same problem of ill-fitting lid as the 06857 model.

### In the Box

### 9.0 - Pan

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/presto-electric-skillet-06852-pan-clu2c33lh000ktf884dia3cm2.jpg" alt="The pan of the Presto Electric Skillet 06852 is 15.71 inches in length, 11.73 inches in width, and 2.79 inches in depth." width="300px" height="200px">

Cooking Capacity: 8.9 qt.

Dimensions: L15.71 x W11.73 x H2.79 inches

Material: Cast aluminum

Coating: Teflon

Handle: Thermosetting plastic

Spout: No

Dishwasher-Safe: Yes

The Presto skillet boasts a 0.16-inch (4 mm) thick cast aluminum pan, which offers superior durability compared to non-cast aluminum (+4). The added thickness of the pan promotes more even heat distribution and reduces the likelihood of deformation under heat.

Our hand-measured capacity of the pan is 8.9 quarts, with an estimated usable volume of around 8 quarts (+1). It’s dishwasher-safe and features fixed handles but lacks a pouring spout (+3).

The surface of the pan is textured similarly to a cast iron skillet, enhancing its visual appeal. However, its impact on cooking performance remains uncertain to us.

The non-stick coating of the pan is Teflon, which is typically more budget-friendly than ceramic coating(+1). However, some individuals may worry about health concerns associated with Teflon, despite the modern formulations being free of PFOA.

### 8.0 - Lid

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/presto-electric-skillet-06852-lid-clu2c348x000ntf884k1beht5.jpg" alt="The tempered glass lid of the Presto Electric Skillet 06852 has a steam vent." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Tempered glass

Handle: Steel

Steam Vent: Yes

Dishwasher-Safe: Yes

The tempered glass lid is dishwasher-safe (+4). It has a steel handle and a steam vent to relieve pressure build-up during cooking (+3). However, the metal edging, while common, does not fit the pan as tightly as observed in some other skillets (+1).

### 4.0 - Base

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/presto-electric-skillet-06852-base-clu2c36hr000rtf8863ds09hw.jpg" alt="The base of the Presto Electric Skillet 06852 has four stands." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Thermosetting plastic

Detachable: No

Anti-Slip Pads: No

Dishwasher-Safe: Yes

The Presto 06852 has two screw-on thermosetting plastic handles that also act as the base similarly to most other skillets (+2). These handles can go in the dishwasher along with the pan or separated for your convenience (+2). However, they lack anti-slip pads at the bottom for the extra grip on the table (+0).

### 7.0 - Thermostat

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/presto-electric-skillet-06852-thermostat-clu2c3054000htf88h9oo6w3n.jpg" alt="The thermostat of the Presto Electric Skillet 06852 has 6 settings including Warm-200–250-300-350-400°F." width="300px" height="200px">

Temperature Range: Warm-200–250-300-350-400°F

Detachable: Yes

Indicator Light: Yes

Dishwasher-Safe: No

The detachable thermostat features a standard temperature range of 200 to 400°F (+3). Meanwhile, the warm setting, which is approximately 150°F, does not maintain the set temperature like some other skillets.

The thermostat fits the socket nicely, facilitating easy removal (+2). It includes an indicator light but is not dishwasher-safe, similar to most other electric skillets (+2).

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/presto-electric-skillet-06852-power-cord-clu2c321w000itf88focrfytr.jpg" alt="The flat two-prong power cord of the Presto Electric Skillet 06852 is 31.1 inches long." width="300px" height="200px">

Type: Two-prong

Length: 31.1" (79.0 cm)

Power: 1500 W

Rated Output: 120 V ~ 60 Hz

The power cord features a flat design and measures 31.1 inches in length, which, while slightly shorter than preferred, is adequate for cooking on a kitchen counter. It has a two-prong plug, which is generally perceived as less safe than a grounded three-prong plug.

The Presto Non-Stick Electric Skillet 06852 doesn’t have ultra-convenient detachable and foldable handles like the 06857 model but it’s easy to use, clean, and store away. The biggest problem was how easily displaced it was due to a lack of anti-slip pads.

### 5.0 - Ease of Use

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/presto-electric-skillet-06852-ease-use-clu2c33lp000ltf8817lu0nlg.jpg" alt="The Presto Electric Skillet 06852 with its thermostat inserted." width="300px" height="200px">

We found that the thermostat was a nice fit and the temperatures stayed precise (+2). Also, the skillet's exterior consistently maintained a safe temperature, eliminating the risk of accidental burning (+3).

However, the indicator light is below the surface of the thermostat so it can be slightly difficult to see under bright lighting. Additionally, with no anti-slip pads on the base, we had a few cases where we accidentally knocked into the skillet and it started sliding away.

### 9.0 - Cleaning and Storing

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/electric-skillets/presto-electric-skillet-06852-cleaning-storing-clu2c35k5000ptf88ady98ev9.jpg" alt="Burnt caramel on the surface of the Presto Electric Skillet 06852." width="300px" height="200px">

As anticipated from a high-quality non-stick pan, the food is effortlessly released from the surface, requiring only a quick, mild-soapy hand wash for cleaning (+4). Grease from the nooks and crannies along the textured surface cleaned out easily as well (+1).

The screw-on handles give you the option of dismantling them to put in the dishwasher or store away. (+4).
