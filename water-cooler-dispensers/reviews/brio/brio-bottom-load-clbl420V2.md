We purchased the Brio 400 in order to evaluate a more budget-priced [bottom loading water cooler dispenser](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-cooler-dispensers/reviews/best/). Of the initial nine machines we purchased for testing, only the Brio 400 arrived not in working order.

The cooling function on the machine failed to work, but the hot water was fine. However, considering design flaws and questionable build quality, we decided not to make any warranty claim. Furthermore, the hot water performance was below par.

In terms of dispensing water, the buttons were poor quality, especially the hot water safety mechanism. The working indicators on the panel were not intuitively positioned, the machine lacked a power status indicator, and the cabinet door showed poor workmanship.

The Brio 400 is an older series and even considering its lower price, we would not recommend it as a worthwhile water cooler dispenser to buy. We do, however, hope to test other Brio models in order to gauge the quality of the brand overall.

**Things We Like**

*   Hot water temperature
*   Contrasting color scheme

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Overall performance
*   Panel indicators
*   Buttons
*   General build quality

Brio is a fairly well-established name in water cooler dispensers. They carry a full product range including top loading, bottom loading, countertop, and POU filter systems. This Brio 400 is one of their older models with the 500 and 600 being the newer series.

Performance
-----------

performance Scores: **3.2**

*   Hot Water Test (40%) - **8.0**/10
    
*   Cold Water Test (60%) - **0**/10
    

The Brio 400 was one of our major disappointments in the testing room. Not only was the build quality sub standard, but parts of the design were flawed and the performance wanting. 

In part, the machine we purchased was faulty and failed to cool the water. Considering the poor design and build quality, we decided not to request a replacement and to forgo the cold water testing.

### Hot Water Test

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-hot-water-test-clhvmpsku0004ey8867nd8kro.jpg" alt="Water temperature being measured as hot water flows out the nozzle of a water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px">

Heating Time: 6.5

35% \* 6.5 = 2.3

Temperature: 10

45% \* 10 = 4.5

Flow Rate: 6

20% \* 6 = 1.2

Single Draw Capacity: 23.29 fl.oz.

Heating Time: 8.5 fl.oz. / 3 min 6 sec

Temperature: 198 ℉

Flow Rate: 1.4 fl.oz. or 42 ml / sec

For this Brio 400, only the hot water temperature test measured up to standard. The heating time was comparatively lengthy. Additionally, the flow rate was significantly faster than advertised and likewise also unfavorable.

#### Heating Time Comparatively Long (6.5 / 35%)

The Brio took approximately 3 min 6 sec to heat 8.5 fl. oz. (250 ml) of water. This was one the slowest times we measured. Compared to machines with a similar hot water tank capacity, such as the [Avalon A1](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-cooler-dispensers/reviews/avalon/avalon-a1-top-loading/), you have to wait a little longer for the tank to fill and reheat. The time to reheat a refilled tank was often seven and a half minutes, and performance was erratic.

#### Temperature a Good Standard (10 / 45%)

The highest continuous flow temperature measure was 198 ℉ (92.2 ℃) which was pretty much the same as most of our top performing machines. It also matched the maximum temperature advertised in the product specifications. This temperature also matched our top benchmark as per our [hot water test procedure](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-cooler-dispensers/tests/hot-water/).

#### Serving Capacity as Claimed

In a single draw, the Brio 400 dispenses on average 18.07 fl.oz (535 ml) at its optimal temperature. That’s enough for two 7.4 fl.oz. (220 ml) paper cups at the optimal temperature. 

We also measure the back-to-back or single draw volume until the temperature drops by 3℃ and the heating light switches on some seconds later. 

The full single draw volume was around 690 ml. This means you can get two large mug cups back-to-back, with one at a slightly lower temperature. This, however, is not so good in terms of efficient design.

With heating times factored in, the amount of hot water per hour works out to 256 fl. oz. (4.6 L). This was pretty much in line with the manufacturer's specifications.

#### Flow Rate Too Fast (6 / 20%)

Not all water cooler dispenser manufacturers clearly mention the flow rate of their machines. Brio, however, lists the flow rate as 35 ml/sec. Our favored benchmark is slightly less at 34 ml/sec, however, this Brio 400 repeatedly recorded 42 ml/sec (1.4 fl.oz.). The hot water flowed a little too swiftly, which reflected the faultiness of the machine.

### Cold Water Test

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-cold-water-test-clf21b3qf002aip881vhxathb.jpg" alt="A paper cup standing on the drip tray of a water cooler dispenser below the cold water spout." width="300px" height="200px">

Serving Capacity: Not recorded

Temperature: Not recorded

Of the eight water cooler dispensers we initially purchased for our first round of testing, this Brio 400 was the only machine to arrive not in full working order. Another budget machine, [the Costway](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-cooler-dispensers/reviews/costway/costway-5-gallon-top-loading/), actually had a small leak but we could still do the testing.

We hope to test other Brio models to gauge more accurately the quality and performance of the brand overall. For other issues we encountered, read more under ‘Ease of Use’ and ‘Design’ further below.

Design
------

design Scores: **5.9**

*   Build Quality (45%) - **5.0**/10
    
*   Panel & Indicators (25%) - **5.5**/10
    
*   Water Inlet Controls (20%) - **7.5**/10
    
*   Drip Tray (10%) - **7.3**/10
    

The Brio 400 is a machine lacking in design foresight, especially concerning the working panel indicators and buttons. The build quality of the cabinet door and the drip tray were noticeably poor. On the other hand, we appreciated the color design with light gray offset against the black panel and sides.

### In the Box

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-box-clf21djxg002bip88a53dfxup.jpg" alt="The unboxed Brio 400 water cooler dispenser with an open cabinet door, and the drip tray plus bundled literature to the side." width="300px" height="200px">

*   Assembled machine
*   Water probe with bottle cap
*   Detachable drip tray
*   English language manual
*   Warranty and support card

The Brio 400 came boxed with the drip tray wrapped in plastic and placed within the cabinet. An English language manual, with a warranty and support card, were also placed neatly in the cabinet. The water probe was likewise wrapped in protective plastic.

### 5.0 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-build-quality-clf21eruu002cip88aeh57k5d.jpg" alt="Side view of the body of the Brio 400 water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-build-quality-1-clf21f96c002dip887kbc2qza.jpg" alt="Ventilation slats on the side body of a freestanding water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-build-quality-2-clf21fuun002eip885yfg9az0.jpg" alt="A pump attached to the cabinet ceiling of a bottom loading water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-build-quality-3-clf21gbjw002fip885kb63bm4.jpg" alt="View of the plastic base of a freestanding water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-build-quality-4-clf21n8ku002hip887rbn3qe9.jpg" alt="Close up of plastic stopper feet on the bottom of a water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px">

Side Body: Gloss black stainless steel

Front Panel: Gray and black plastic

Cabinet Door: Silver plastic, white inside

Base: Plastic

Extra Features: Carry handle

The quality of the side panels with ventilation slats is much the same as other similar machines. The door and cabinet, however, was noticeable for its poor workmanship and low quality.

Other build quality issues are highlighted with the overall poor performance, button designs, panel design flaws, and cheap quality of the drip tray.

The only thing about the design we actually liked was the color scheme of light gray contrasted to black. This gave the machine a brighter appearance and made it easier to see the dispensing nozzles.

### 5.5 - Panel & Indicators

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-panel-indicators-clf21owx4002iip88cd6dd2nz.jpg" alt="Close up view of the working panel indicators and buttons of the Brio 400 water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-panel-indicators-1-clf21pee2002jip884tfh1qqs.jpg" alt="Close up of the bottle indicator lit up and working on the display panel of a bottom-loading water cooler dispenser. " width="300px" height="200px">

Power Status: None

Hot Water: Middle

Cold Water: Left

Bottle Or Filter: Right

Others: None

The first thing to notice about the panel is the lack of a power status button. The only advantage to this would be if the machine were placed in a bedroom or other sleeping space.

Secondly, the icons are not logically positioned. The indicator for cooling is situated more or less below the hot water dispensing zone, and the heating icon is to the right in the middle.

The empty bottle and pump indicator is on the far right. Although this indicator came on when the door was opened or the water was pumping, it failed to alert when the bottle was actually empty.

### 7.5 - Water Inlet Controls

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-water-inlet-controls-clf21qmic002kip88a24zezm4.jpg" alt="A water baffle removed from inside the cold water tank of a water cooler dispenser and displayed above the tank." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-water-inlet-controls-1-clf21r7jj002lip889kzzgh13.jpg" alt="Inside a cold water tank of a water cooler dispenser showing how a pipe connects to the top of a water baffle." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-water-inlet-controls-2-clf21rtmq002mip88d5bbfbfn.jpg" alt="The perfectly straight water straw of a water cooler dispenser resting against the inside of the cabinet door." width="300px" height="200px">

Mechanism: Pump, bottle probe, water baffle

Materials: Stainless steel, plastic

Extra Features: None

The bottle cap and connected water hose are of decent quality and a standard generic design often seen in other machines. The water pump is attached to the cabinet ceiling, but it lacks a rubber bracket or vibrational support.

The water probe is a straight rod and therefore not as efficient as the more usual bended design. We found the water baffle to be of a standard generic quality, with no apparent flaws, and it was easy to remove and replace.

### Water Dispensers

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-water-dispensers-clf21syxv002nip88cixucg6w.jpg" alt="Top down view of three dispensing buttons of a freestanding water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-water-dispensers-1-clf21teu8002oip881l3haqcy.jpg" alt="A hand holding down the middle button on a water cooler dispenser to demonstrate the space between the buttons." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-water-dispensers-2-clf21tww7002pip881u4v7ncs.jpg" alt="A view from beneath looking up at the detail of three water spouts on a water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px">

Mechanism: 3 buttons

Outflow Points: 3 recessed panel nozzles

Material: Plastic

Extra Features: Hot water Safety

The buttons, at least, are well sized and built into the front of the machine, so not protruding. Some may like this look, but we found the design lacking in terms of hygienic upkeep because you can’t clean between the buttons so easily.

The nozzles, however, were easy to clean as detailed in our ease-of-use evaluation. The traction of the buttons when dispensing water is not bad—perhaps a little stiff— but not as stiff as the buttons on another machine we tested, the [Euhomy](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-cooler-dispensers/reviews/e-euhomy/euhomy-bottom-loading-wc-c/).

### 7.3 - Drip Tray

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-drip-tray-clf21uvcd002qip88622dhjtt.jpg" alt="A close up of a drip tray found on a water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-drip-tray-1-clf21vccw002rip880balcj6q.jpg" alt="A gloved hand removing the cover from the drip tray of a water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-drip-tray-2-clf21vv1u002sip88f257csx5.jpg" alt="A gloved hand showing a drip tray of a water cooler dispenser removed from its slot and the cover slightly removed." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic

Color: Light gray

Length: 9.7" (24.6 cm)

Width: 2.9" (7.4 cm)

Depth: 1.4" (3.6 cm)

Level Float: No

The drip tray is relatively small and doesn’t fit large cups so well, so sometimes it’s best to hold the cup while dispensing. Additionally, the tray fixture is not very secure and a child could possibly tug it out. The plastic is a little flimsy and not a hard and solid design. The gray color, however, is a nice contrast and makes it easy to see the water level.

### Rear Switches

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-rear-switches-clf21wqgj002tip88aoy6gmvb.jpg" alt="Close up of two switches at the rear of a water cooler dispenser - green for the cold water tank and red for the hot." width="300px" height="200px">

Hot Water: Rear top right

Cold Water: Rear top left

Others: None

There are only two switches which are to the rear right of the machine—left for the cold water tank, and the right for hot.This model does not have an ozone function or night light. Each switch is color coded with a text label. Their alignment is somewhat haphazard indicating poor workmanship.

### Door and Cabinet

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-door-cabinet-clf21xo82002uip885y8oad0e.jpg" alt="Water straw hanging on the hook of the cabinet door of a bottom-loading water cooler dispenser while switching bottles." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-door-cabinet-1-clf21y4ai002vip88ffag4mvk.jpg" alt="Bottle cap and water probe of a bottom loading water cooler dispenser hanging from a cabinet door bracket." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-door-cabinet-2-clf21ykn0002wip888ynfh7kq.jpg" alt="The door safety pump switch of a bottom loading water cooler dispenser.

The pump switches off if the door opens." width="300px" height="200px">

Has Door: Yes

InternalWDH: 10.5 x 11.5 x 18.5 in

Material: Silver plastic, white inside

Extra Features: Bracket hook, pump switch

To open the door, it’s best to grip it from the bottom since there is no side or pocket handle. On closer inspection, we found the inside panel badly aligned indicating poor workmanship. The white color does, however, add to a somewhat brighter feel.

### Cord and Plug

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-cord-plug-clf220cbb002yip880se0fgpv.jpg" alt="A gloved hand holding the three pronged plug of the Brio 400 water cooler dispenser up against the front control panel." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-cord-plug-1-clf220vwu002zip8800o43kmx.jpg" alt="A man holding the electric cord of a water cooler dispenser double folded across the body in a horizontal position." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 6.1 ft (1.9 m)

Position: Rear rt., 25.5 in from ground

Plug Type: Type B - two flat pins, one grounding pin

The plug of the Brio 400 water cooler dispenser is the required three-pronged plug with two flat pins and a round grounding prong. The cord is likewise a standard 73 inches long.

Ease of Use
-----------

usability Scores: **6.8**

*   Dispensing Water (40%) - **6.5**/10
    
*   Hot Water Safety (15%) - **7.5**/10
    
*   Bottle/Filter Changing (15%) - **8.0**/10
    
*   Cleaning (30%) - **6.3**/10
    

The Brio 400 only measured up to competitive standards, as per our [evaluation criteria](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-cooler-dispensers/tests/), when it came to changing the water bottle. The buttons were somewhat clunky, the hot water safety uncomfortable to operate, and sanitary design was not ideal. We also encountered issues with periodic descaling.

### 6.5 - Dispensing Water

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-dispensing-water-clf2234vp0030ip880mz2eutr.jpg" alt="A paper cup resting on the drip tray of a water cooler dispenser while hot water is being dispensed." width="300px" height="200px">

Mechanism: Push button

Water Type: Hot, cold, normal temperature

Spout Type: Recessed into panel

Dispensing Height: 7.5 in

The main issue with dispensing water was the faster than normal flow rate. Small cups filled quite rapidly, whereas for larger cups this was not such an issue. Additionally, the buttons look cheap and make a noticeably clunky sound. In our testing, we have encountered much better designs with more seamless experiences of dispensing water.

### 7.5 - Hot Water Safety

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-hot-water-safety-clf2246vr0031ip88h78a93k4.jpg" alt="Close up top view of three dispensing buttons on a water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-hot-water-safety-1-clf224pia0032ip88hpwbd0la.jpg" alt="A demonstration of how to operate a hot water safety mechanism mounted on the button of a water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px">

Mechanism: Mounted lever

Although the hot water safety mechanism is similar in appearance to other types of button operated machines, the experience was not so ideal. In our testing, the hot safety clip required more force to push sideways and the downward movement was not so smooth. The design is functional, but doesn’t demonstrate good technical design.

### 8.0 - Bottle/Filter Changing

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-bottle-filter-changing-clf227oaf0033ip8820m5b1i5.jpg" alt="The inside of a bottom loading water cooler dispenser with the water straw with a bottle cap resting against the side." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-bottle-filter-changing-1-clf2284wh0034ip888ae55udv.jpg" alt="A water straw being placed into a 5-gallon water bottle in front of a bottom-loading water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-bottle-filter-changing-2-clf228ndd0035ip889q9t9t3f.jpg" alt="Close up of a plastic bottle cap being placed onto a bottom-loading water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/brio-bottom-load-water-dispenser-bottle-filter-changing-3-clf2294fd0036ip886b2l9zlz.jpg" alt="Close up of a bottle cap on a 5-gallon water jug of a bottom-loading water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px">

Design: Bottom loading

Feature: Bottle probe, water baffle, door pump switch

The water straw or bottle probe of the Brio 400 is a simple straight rod. In most cases the rod is bent for better positioning and maximum draw of water from large and small bottle types. The bottle cap design is fairly generic, but the straight probe indicates more of an ‘economy’ design.

### 6.3 - Cleaning

Self Cleaning: None

Drainage Plug: Rear rt., 21 in from ground

The all plastic body is not prone to getting fingerprints so it’s also easy to wipe and keep clean. The close-up design of the buttons, however, makes it difficult to clean in between them.

As with other button operated machines, the spouts are easy to clean around. Since this machine does not have ozone or UV cleansing, you can regularly clean around the inside of the nozzles with a cotton Q-tip.

As for periodic descaling, opening up the top of the machine and accessing the cold water tank was much the same as similar machines. The quality of the water baffle was fine and the design fairly generic.

One issue we did have, however, was with draining the machine. The drainage plug is a good design but drainage was poor. The water stream was weak and it tended to dribble and mess a lot of water. Furthermore, there were no instructions in the manual about how to do periodic descaling.
