The Igloo [bottled water cooler dispenser](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-cooler-dispensers/reviews/best/) is a small countertop machine. It’s able to serve around 15 people per hour with perfectly chilled cold water (52‒54℉). The hot water capacity is reasonably good compared to even larger machines. It’s lower temperature of 185℉ is sometimes preferred to the upper standard of 198℉.

The main disappointment, however, was the slow flow rate. Additionally, the buttons are not the best design nor quality.

For these reasons, the Igloo may or may not be a good fit for a small office water cooler dispenser. It is, however, not a bad choice for a personal water cooler dispenser, especially for a studio apartment or a dorm room.

**Things We Like**

*   Cold Water Test (60%) - **4.5**/10
    

The Igloo produced quite mixed results with its hot water performance. It scored zero for the slow flow rate, but this is hardly the top consideration for a budget-class machine. Its working temperature is a lower 185 ℉ rather than the upper 198 ℉. The heating time was fast, partly due to the lower temperature, and the capacity was pretty decent.

### Hot Water Test

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/igloo-countertop-water-dispenser-hot-water-test-clhvn1f510008ey880hqr95od.jpg" alt="Water temperature being measured as hot water flows out the nozzle of a water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px">

Heating Time: 10

35% \* 10 = 3.5

Temperature: 5

45% \* 5 = 2.3

Flow Rate: 0

20% \* 0 = 0.0

Single Draw Capacity: 21.5 fl. oz.

Heating Time: 8.5 fl.oz. / 1 min 57 sec

Temperature: 185 ℉

Flow Rate: 0.4 fl.oz. / or 12 ml /sec

In [our hot water test](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-cooler-dispensers/tests/hot-water/), the Igloo didn’t fail to impress in at least one way—the heating time was one of the fastest. However, the temperature was also one of the lowest we recorded. The capacity was fairly good, but the flow rate was slow. As such, this budget machine is likely to only satisfy basic needs.

#### Heating Time Pretty Fast (10 / 35%)

The Igloo took roughly 1 min 57 sec to heat 250 ml of water, but at the same time, the temperature only reached 185 ℉ (85℃). It certainly kept us on our toes while testing, but the overall test results were comparatively poor.

#### Temperature Lower Average (5 / 45%)

As mentioned, the Igloo’s maximum hot water temperature is only 185 ℉ (85℃) and similar to the [Euhomy dispenser](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-cooler-dispensers/reviews/e-euhomy/euhomy-bottom-loading-wc-c/). This temperature is good enough for instant coffee, hot chocolate, and delicate teas. It’s not such a suitable temperature for pour-over coffee bags or regular English tea. If you don’t need piping hot water, and all other things considered, this budget machine may or may not be the one for you.

#### Serving Capacity Quite Good

On the upside, the Igloo did manage to produce 21.5 fl. oz. (635 ml) in our single draw tests which measured the complete water draw until the tank light switched on. That’s a good amount of water all considered. Basically, you can get around 210 fl. oz. or 6.2 L per hour. Once again, a good number excluding the temperature, and the slow flow rate!

#### Flow Rate Rather Dismal (0 / 20%)

Although the Igloo impressed with its ready-to-go status, it disappointed with the press of a button. The flow rate of 12 ml/sec was about the slowest we recorded. Dispensing hot water, therefore, requires some patience.

Since this is a budget machine, we didn’t expect an all-round perfect performance. However, the flow rate was unable to notch up even one point on our scoring scale. Other budget machines, like the [top loading Cosway](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-cooler-dispensers/reviews/costway/costway-5-gallon-top-loading/), have a similar low flow rate.

### Cold Water Test

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/igloo-countertop-water-dispenser-cold-water-test-clf2560q6003eip88bsv29hdd.jpg" alt="Cold water testing on the Igloo countertop water cooler dispenser. A thermometer is measuring cold water flowing into a cup." width="300px" height="200px">

Serving Capacity: 78 fl. oz. / Hr

Temperature: 50-54 ℉

Although we encountered some build quality issues, for the price and quality, the [cold water test](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-cooler-dispensers/tests/cold-water/) performance was quite acceptable.

Cooling times are a little slow and we found it took around 35 minutes to recalibrate the machine to its low of 46 ℉—or the green cooling light to switch off. Basically, you can get a nice chilled glass (8.5 fl.oz.) of water every 8 minutes. That works out to around 78 fl. oz. (2.3 L) per hour or enough for 15 people.

This countertop Igloo is a worthwhile budget choice for a small personal water cooler dispenser. Since it doesn’t have a power status light, it may suit a dorm room or a studio apartment.

Design
------

design Scores: **6.2**

*   Build Quality (45%) - **5.3**/10
    
*   Panel & Indicators (25%) - **7.2**/10

The Igloo hot and cold water dispenser is quite an eye-catching machine. Its pure white color and neat push buttons stand out. On closer inspection, a number of features such as the buttons, drip tray, and drainage plug show their flaws.

We liked the clean panel design and the nice buttons at the rear. Also, this is one of the few water cooler dispensers we found to have adjustable legs. The overall quality and performance, while acceptable for the price, were not outstanding.

### In the Box

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/igloo-countertop-water-dispenser-box-clf2579vx003fip880v3k1vs1.jpg" alt="The unboxed Igloo countertop water cooler dispenser with the included drip tray and user manual shown on the far right." width="300px" height="200px">

*   Machine unit

*   User manual

The Igloo bottled water cooler dispenser came nicely boxed and the box also illustrated the product. Included was also the user manual in English, Spanish, and French. The drip tray was separate and wrapped in protective plastic.

Side Body: White metal sheeting

Front Panel: White plastic

Cabinet Door: No

Base: Metal plate with rubber feet

Extra Features: Adjustable feet

The sides of the Igloo bottled water cooler dispenser are metal plated with ventilation slats. However, the plastic front panel and roof are comparatively lower quality. Also, on this machine, the joining between the side panels and the front panel was not perfect.

The rear has a double-plied metal grate to ensure space for cooling. As mentioned, it’s rather sharp at the bottom so you should lift the machine from the sides.

On a high note, the Igloo has adjustable feet stabilizing on an uneven surface. This is something we have not encountered so often on other water cooler dispenser designs. We also like that the bottom of the machine is a solid metal plate and not plastic.

Overall, the build quality of the body is not too bad for the price. It’s more that the button design, slow flow rate, and dispensing area could be better.

### 7.2 - Panel & Indicators

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/igloo-countertop-water-dispenser-panel-indicators-clf25fzip003mip88hoen6p6x.jpg" alt="A close up of the working panel of the Igloo countertop water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/igloo-countertop-water-dispenser-panel-indicators-1-clf25gg1m003nip88gcp0cf7j.jpg" alt="A close up of the icons of a small water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px">

Power Status: None

Hot Water: Top left

Cold Water: Top right

Bottle Or Filter: No

Others: None

The panel design is quite basic and we liked that it avoids the generic look. There are clear elongated vertical indicators directly over the hot and cold dispensing points. The additional cup icons are an original design and easy to understand.

There is no indicator for the position of normal water except for the middle area of the drip tray. Some people may like this minimalist design. Additionally, with no power indicator to light up the night, this machine is a good fit for a dorm room or studio apartment.

### 6.5 - Water Inlet Controls

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/igloo-countertop-water-dispenser-water-inlet-controls-clf25hse7003oip88cxqn0tmz.jpg" alt="Close of a detachable water needle found on a small countertop top-loading water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/igloo-countertop-water-dispenser-water-inlet-controls-1-clf25igc1003pip88dxpyain3.jpg" alt="A gloved hand showing a partly removed water guard from a top loading water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/igloo-countertop-water-dispenser-water-inlet-controls-2-clf25j2hn003qip88gf0x0j84.jpg" alt="A top down view of a typical water baffle found in the tank of a top loading water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/igloo-countertop-water-dispenser-water-inlet-controls-3-clf25jsqv003rip881dr7h33m.jpg" alt="A gloved hand holding a water baffle removed from a cold water tank of a water cooler dispenser. " width="300px" height="200px">

Mechanism: Water guard, water baffle

Materials: Plastic

Extra Features: None

The water guard appears to be a generic part as we have encountered an identical design on similar low-priced water cooler dispensers. The water guard comes off easily and is well-made. The baffle, however, is a bit shoddy and also difficult to remove and replace. The Igloo bottled water cooler dispenser overall tends to cut corners where quality really matters.

### Water Dispensers

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/igloo-countertop-water-dispenser-water-dispensers-clf25l3p6003sip88553p5z1s.jpg" alt="A close up top down view of three white buttons of a water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/igloo-countertop-water-dispenser-water-dispensers-1-clf25lls2003tip88dsbkcmmw.jpg" alt="A bottom up view of three water nozzles found on a water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px">

Mechanism: 3 buttons

Outflow Points: 3 recessed panel nozzles

Material: Plastic

Extra Features: Original icon designs

The buttons are a good size but they are a little stiff and also somewhat noisy when pressing down. While the flush design looks neat, we found cleaning in between can be a hassle. The nozzles, although a basic plastic design, are good enough for the price of the machine. We discuss these more in ‘Ease of Use’.

### 7.0 - Drip Tray

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/igloo-countertop-water-dispenser-drip-tray-clf25mlwd003uip88c5w64u0l.jpg" alt="A top down view of a white colored drip tray of a small countertop water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/igloo-countertop-water-dispenser-drip-tray-1-clf25n0aw003vip887bc0bbgc.jpg" alt="A gloved hand showing holding up the cover of a drip tray found on a water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/igloo-countertop-water-dispenser-drip-tray-2-clf25ngn4003wip8841enargz.jpg" alt="A gloved hand holding a drip tray of a water cooler dispenser with the cover askew and removed from its holding." width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic

Color: White

Length: 21.1" (53.6 cm)

Width: 2.9" (7.4 cm)

Depth: 1.6" (4.1 cm)

Level Float: No

The drip tray is a durable and hard plastic. It’s completely childproof and can only be removed by lifting up and pulling forward.

The tray is quite narrow which is not uncommon for countertop machines, especially [ones with paddle levers](https://healthykitchen101.com/water-cooler-dispensers/reviews/avalon/avalon-a8-countertop-bottleless/). However, for a more spacious button design, there’s not much room for resting a mug cup on the drip tray.

The openness and white color of the cover make the water easy to see, but at the same time somewhat unsightly. Although functional and unlikely to break, the drip tray quality matches the price of the machine.

### Rear Switches

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/igloo-countertop-water-dispenser-rear-switches-clf25p1wq003xip8841a1gs7l.jpg" alt="Two tank switches found on the rear of a water cooler dispenser. The right is red and the left green, both with on/off labels." width="300px" height="200px">

Hot Water: Yes

Cold Water: Yes

Others: None

The switches are good quality and color-coded red and green. They are not the usual generic design and add a little distinction to the machine. The switches illuminate when on and the labeling is clear.

### Door and Cabinet

Has Door: No

InternalWDH: N/A

Material: N/A

Extra Features: N/A

### Cord and Plug

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/igloo-countertop-water-dispenser-cord-plug-clf25pwue003yip888eptdlou.jpg" alt="A man holding the electric cable of a small water cooler dispenser double folded across its horizontal length." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/igloo-countertop-water-dispenser-cord-plug-2-clf25qu8l0040ip884c14408b.jpg" alt="A gloved hand showing the plug of the Igloo water cooler dispenser against the front panel background." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/igloo-countertop-water-dispenser-cord-plug-3-clf25rg9f0041ip885xrb1sk8.jpg" alt="A close up of the position of the electric cord in close proximity to the water drainage port of a water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 6.2 ft (1.9 m)

Position: Rear rt., 4.3 in

Plug Type: Type B - two flat pins, one grounding pin

The cord is relatively long for the size of the machine and it is about 2 inches well above the drainage port. The plug is also standard for a water cooler dispenser.

Ease of Use

Although the Igloo bottled water cooler dispenser is a budget choice for a countertop machine, the only thing that measured up to easy use was changing the bottle.

The stiffness of the buttons, the poor design of the hot water safety mechanism, and the slow flow rate made dispensing with ease below par.

While day-to-day cleaning was easy with minimal fingerprinting, periodic descaling had its challenges. The main being the poor design of the water baffle, difficulty in moving the machine, and the drainage port design.

### 5.5 - Dispensing Water

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/igloo-countertop-water-dispenser-dispensing-water-clf25uyav0043ip882y7q1i9a.jpg" alt="A person dispensing hot water from the Igloo hot and cold water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/igloo-countertop-water-dispenser-dispensing-water-1-clf264mdb0044ip883ezvac1l.jpg" alt="A person dispensing cold water from the Igloo bottled water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px">

Mechanism: Push button

Water Type: Hot, cold, normal temperature

Spout Type: Recessed panel type

Dispensing Height: 9 in

There were a number of features that detracted from easy and comfortable dispensing. The first was the slow flow rate which made dispensing water a little tedious.

Added to this, the hot water safety mechanism was cumbersome and felt rough and uncomfortable to touch. The buttons were also relatively noisy to operate and the traction was a little stiff.

A minor factor was the small drip tray and narrow dispensing space. This is not so uncommon for smaller countertop designs. For a roomier push-button machine, resting a cup or tumbler on the tray while dispensing requires caution.

### 6.0 - Hot Water Safety

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/igloo-countertop-water-dispenser-hot-water-safety-clf265om00045ip885bkgd4z5.jpg" alt="Close up of the hot water button on a countertop water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/igloo-countertop-water-dispenser-hot-water-safety-1-clf2664ym0046ip88cvcubw23.jpg" alt="A gloved finger showing how to operate a hot water safety mechanism on the button of a hot water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px">

Mechanism: Mounted lever

The design of the hot water safety mechanism appears standard for a button dispensing machine. However, the red lever was difficult to slide across unless you pushed from behind. Furthermore, the button pressed down at an uneven angle and the stiff traction didn’t help either. The design, at least, is functional.

### 7.5 - Bottle / Filter Changing

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/igloo-countertop-water-dispenser-bottle-filter-changing-clf2672qi0047ip88d3oq4i71.jpg" alt="A water bottle loaded onto the Igloo hot and cold water cooler dispenser." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/water-cooler-dispensers/igloo-countertop-water-dispenser-bottle-filter-changing-1-clf267ilm0048ip88aot4e0qo.jpg" alt="Top down view of a countertop water cooler dispenser showing the water guard and water needle.

Design: Top loading

Feature: Water guard and needle

Changing the bottle on the Igloo is much the same as any other top-loading water cooler dispenser. The only thing that made it easier is that a countertop dispenser is at a more comfortable height. A five-liter bottle fitted quite securely since the machine itself is comparatively a little larger and heavier compared to other countertop models.

### 6.2 - Cleaning

Self Cleaning: No

Drainage Plug: Rear rt., 2 in from ground

Nozzle cleaning is a bonus with any button-type dispenser, including this Igloo. They are easy to wipe around and you can clean inside with a cotton Q-tip. However, the buttons have a flush design so it was not so easy to clean in between them.

A major drawback was the difficulty in moving the machine. There are no side pockets so you have to grip and lift by sliding your fingers under the base. The bottom of the rear metal grate is somewhat sharp. Therefore, you should move the machine lifting from the side if moving to a sink edge for drainage.

The drainage plug does have a rubber stopper, so as soon as it is released even a little, water will start coming out. The material quality and design are equally poor. A significant amount of water still remains after draining, so you should flush this out of the spouts before cleaning.

Although a minor concern, we felt the water guard came off a little too easily. The water baffle is also cheaply made, difficult to remove, and rather troublesome to fit back into place.
