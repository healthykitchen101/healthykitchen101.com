If you want to preserve your food for longer and reduce wastage, there aren’t any better ways than vacuum sealing. Pack up the food in a plastic bag and put it in the fridge. The airtight environment, combined with the coolness of the fridge, will significantly improve the shelf-life of the food (by days, even weeks!)

We've gathered a selection of top-rated vacuum sealers from Amazon and put them to the test in our laboratory. For our initial performance assessment, we chose to work with dry food, specifically black rice grains. Dry foods, especially grains like rice, can be trickier to vacuum seal compared to moist foods like raw meat. This is because tiny air gaps between the grains can pose a challenge for the sealer to eliminate completely. As a result, this experiment is the ideal opportunity to gauge the vacuum sealer's capabilities.

Testing Procedure
-----------------

We will begin by filling a bag with 2.2 pounds (1 kilogram) of rice, vacuuming it, and sealing it. The bag will be connected to a vacuum pressure gauge, which measures the pressure in kPA. Additionally, we will time how long each sealing session takes using a timer.

For each model, we will conduct two measurements, and then we'll calculate the average of the results.

It's important to note that a lower pressure reading on the gauge indicates that more air has been successfully removed from the bag. The gauge will display this result as a negative number to indicate a vacuum. On the other hand, the time it takes to complete the vacuum and seal the bag reflects the efficiency of the vacuum sealer, with shorter times being preferable.

Scoring Metrics
---------------

The total score that the sealer gets in the dry food test is the sum of two sub-scores — performance and sealing time — divided by two.

### Performance

Performance is measured by the vacuum pressure gauge in kPA.

*   Above 70 kPA - 10 points
*   70-65 kPA - 9 points
*   60-65 kPA - 8 points
*   55-60 kPA - 7 points
*   50-55 kPA - 6 points
*   45-50 kPA - 5 points
*   40-45 kPA - 4 points
*   35-40 kPA - 3 points
*   30-35 kPA - 2 points
*   25-30 kPA - 1 point
*   Below 25 kPA - 0 point

The Geryon E2900-MS vacuum sealer during a dry food test. According to the vacuum gauge, it reached a peak suction of 44 kPA, giving it a 4/10 in the test.

### Sealing Time

Sealing time is measured by the timer that starts from the time the sealer’s vacuum activates and to the time it turns off and the bag is sealed.

*   Under 10 seconds - 10 points
*   10-15 seconds - 9 points
*   15-20 seconds - 8 points
*   20-25 seconds - 7 points
*   25-30 seconds - 6 points
*   30-35 seconds - 5 points
*   Above 35 seconds - 0 point
