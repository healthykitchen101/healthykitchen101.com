Both the GERYON E2900-MS and the CALOTO AP-12X vacuum sealers are meant to service the entry-level food vacuum sealers market. Without looking at their respective price tags, itâ€™s easy to discern this just by looking at their rather cheap designs alone.

When we put the two sealers to the test, both the GERYON E2900-MS and the CALOTO AP-12X exhibited mediocre suction performance across the board. The GERYON received a total performance score of 5.2 out of 10, while the CALOTO straight up failed the test with a score of 4.7.

Usability-wise, both sealers are equal to one another (with the GERYON at a slight advantage due to its indicator lights being brighter and easier to see.)

All in all, the GERYON E2900-MS should be a better pick than the CALOTO AP-12X, though not by a great margin.
