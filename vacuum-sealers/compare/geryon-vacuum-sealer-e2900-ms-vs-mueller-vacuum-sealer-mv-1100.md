Considering how both the GERYON E2900-MS and the Mueller MV-1100 are in the same price range, picking one from the pair can be tough.

The GERYON boasts a better design, with a convenient detachable top piece for easy cleaning. Meanwhile, the Mueller MV-1100 falls short in design and usability due to creaky parts and a tricky control panel, affecting its overall rating.

However, the Mueller shines in performance, outscoring the GERYON in our dry and moist food tests.

If you prioritize suction power, go for the Mueller MV-1100. For basic needs and better usability, consider the GERYON E2900-MS.
