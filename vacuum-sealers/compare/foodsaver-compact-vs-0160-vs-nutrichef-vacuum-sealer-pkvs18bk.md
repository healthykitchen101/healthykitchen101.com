The FoodSaver VS-0160 is at an advantage design-wise with a lighter, more well-built housing. Its performance in our performance test is excellent in both the dry and moist food tests.

On the other hand, the NutriChef is slightly heavier, but comes in a more compact form (great if you don’t have a lot of countertop real estate.) However, the performance of the Nutrichef is fairly disappointing, with a mediocre score in the dry food test portion and a failing score when we used it to vacuum-pack moist, delicate foods.

Overall, you’ll have a better using experience with the FoodSaver VS-0160 than with the Nutrichef.
