The Mueller MV-1100 earns our recommendation primarily due to its high suction power, which, while not extraordinary, surpasses that of the Bonsenkitchen VS-2100. As such, the MV-1100 will make for a more reliable and better-value buy for users seeking an effective sealer without wanting to invest a lot in a good sealer.
