The FoodSaver VS-0160, though priced as a mid-range food vacuum sealer, is an entry-level model within the FoodSaver lineup. It offers basic functionality without extra features like a built-in cutter or bag hooks. However, it excelled in performance tests, boasting high suction power. Its appealing design adds to its charm, making it a recommended choice.

On the other hand, the budget-friendly GERYON E2900-MS has a cheap plastic design but stands out with a removable top piece for easier cleaning. Unfortunately, it scored poorly in our performance tests, receiving a 5.2 out of 10, compared to the FoodSaver's impressive 8.1 out of 10.

All in all, the FoodSaver VS-0160 will give you far more value for the money than the GERYON.
