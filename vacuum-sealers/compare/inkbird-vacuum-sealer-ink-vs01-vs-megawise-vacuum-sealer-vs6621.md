The Inkbird INK-VS01's compact size makes it a popular choice for those with limited countertop space. Despite its small frame, it impresses with powerful suction and sealing performance, ranking among our top sealers. However, some find its design a bit lacking for its price and note a noisy motor during operation.

On the other hand, the Megawise VS6621, while budget-friendly and user-friendly, falls short in vacuum-packing performance, as expected for its lower cost. It shares the compact size of the Inkbird and includes a convenient integrated cutter on the lid.

If you're on a tight budget, the Megawise may suffice. But for superior performance, we recommend investing in the Inkbird INK-VS01. It excels in nearly every aspect, justifying the higher price tag.
