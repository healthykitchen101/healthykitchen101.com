The Nutrichef PKVS18BK stands out for its visually appealing design, well-built lid and locking mechanism, and a simple, intuitive touch control panel. However, it has a loud motor and requires significant force to close the lid properly​​.

Although they’re in the same price range, the design (appearance-wise) of the Megawise VS6621 is a lot more basic. Fortunately, overall build quality in terms of build material and fits-and-finishes are still great. The sealer comes with a built-in bag cutter, which gives it an edge over the Nutrichef that doesn’t have any extra features.

Performance-wise, the Nutrichef performed marginally better in our performance tests, achieving a final performance score of 5.7. Meanwhile, the Megawise hit a middling 5.0.

The Nutrichef, as such, will be the model to choose if you value performance. But the MegaWise is worth considering if you want something easier to use as well as the integrated bag cutter.
