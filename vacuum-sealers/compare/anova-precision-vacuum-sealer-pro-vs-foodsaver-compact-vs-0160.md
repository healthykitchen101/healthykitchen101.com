If you care about how well it sucks, then the FoodSaver beats the Anova. In our tests, the FoodSaver did better, especially when sealing moist foods, scoring 8.1 while the Anova got 7.8. The FoodSaver also has a removable tray to avoid spills when sealing liquids, something the Anova lacks.

On the flip side, the Anova shines with its fancy design and extra features, like a built-in bag cutter and a place to store bags inside. Even though it scored lower than the FoodSaver in performance, it still did pretty well, according to our reviewers.

Many folks will love the good looks and ease of use of the Anova Precision Pro, plus it comes with a longer warranty. Meanwhile, the FoodSaver is a great choice for those looking to save some money.
