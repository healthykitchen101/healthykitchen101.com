The Anova Precision Vacuum Sealer Pro's premium quality and performance are both in stark contrast to the BonsenKitchen VS-2100, which didn’t hold up quite as well in all aspects: performance, design, and usability. The Anova Pro, while costing far more than the BonsenKitchen, will make for an excellent vacuum sealer for those seeking a quality sealer, making it an easy choice over the BonsenKitchen — especially if a good build quality and a smooth using experience is important to you.
