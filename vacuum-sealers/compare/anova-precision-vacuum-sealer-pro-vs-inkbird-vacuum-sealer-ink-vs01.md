Picking between the Anova Precision Vacuum Sealer Pro and Inkbird Vacuum Sealer INK-VS01 will mostly come down to what size vacuum sealer you prefer.

The Anova is a full-size sealer, while the InkBird is far more compact (the Anova has a width of 7.1 inches, while the Inkbird is sleeker at 3.9 inches.) If you want to save countertop space, the Inkbird would be excellent.

In terms of performance, the Anova excels in powerful performance for both dry and moist foods, achieving a total performance score of 8.4. But the Inkbird, despite its compact size, was able to keep up with the Anova with a score of 7.3.
