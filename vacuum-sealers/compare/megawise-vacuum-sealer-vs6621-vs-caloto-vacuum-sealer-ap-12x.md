Both the MegaWise VS6621 and the CALOTO AP-12X appeal to users seeking compact, lightweight, and affordable vacuum sealers. The VS6621, in particular, excels in suction performance, offering a compelling choice for those prioritizing efficiency in a small package.

This is in contrast to the MegaWise VS6621, which has a full-size design, but better performance overall in our tests. As a result, the MegaWise currently stands as the go-to option for people who donâ€™t want to compromise on sealing power.
