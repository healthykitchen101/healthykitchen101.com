The Nesco VS-12 clearly outshines the Mueller MV-1100 in nearly every aspect. It has outstanding sealing performance, with impressive suction power and quicker operation in dry and moist food tests. The Nesco VS-12 also boasts a well-built design that justifies its premium price.

Conversely, the Mueller MV-1100, designed for entry-level users, falls short in suction performance and build quality. Our reviewers noted a creaky lid, uneven lid locks, and overtly-sensitive touch buttons on the control panel.

The Mueller MV-1100, due to it being more affordable, may be appealing for those with only basic vacuum-sealing needs. However, for advanced users, itâ€™ll be worth investing a bit more in the Nesco VS-12.
