Both the Nesco VS-12 Deluxe and FoodSaver VS-0160 are popular vacuum sealers with different strengths.aaa

The Nesco VS-12 Deluxe is great for sealing both dry and moist foods, featuring a user-friendly control panel with an LED screen, a bag roll compartment, and a cutter. However, it's larger, heavier, noisier, and comes with a higher price tag. It offers strong suction power and a two-year warranty.

On the other hand, the FoodSaver VS-0160 is budget-friendly and quieter. It's smaller, lighter, and more compact but has slightly lower suction power and a shorter one-year warranty. It lacks some extra features. In summary, the Nesco VS-12 Deluxe excels in sealing, while the FoodSaver VS-0160 is a compact and budget-friendly choice, depending on your needs and budget.
