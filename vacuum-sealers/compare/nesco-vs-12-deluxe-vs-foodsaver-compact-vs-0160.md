The Nesco VS-12 Deluxe and FoodSaver VS-0160 are both highly regarded vacuum sealers, but they cater to different needs.

The Nesco VS-12 Deluxe excels at sealing both dry and moist foods, boasting a robust build and a user-friendly control panel with an LED screen for tracking progress. It even includes a handy bag roll compartment and cutter. However, it's bulkier and heavier at 15.8 x 7.8 x 4.3 inches and 6.0 lbs. It offers superior suction power (78-80 kPA for dry and 52-70 kPA for moist foods) and a generous two-year warranty, but it comes with a higher price tag and more noise, peaking at 83.4 dBA.

In contrast, the FoodSaver VS-0160 is a budget-friendly option at $86.53, operating more quietly at 77.9 dBA. It's smaller and lighter at 15.7 x 6.1 x 2.7 inches and 5.8 lbs. While it seals food effectively, its suction power is slightly lower (62-63 kPA for dry and 45-58 kPA for moist foods), and it offers only a one-year warranty. It lacks extra features like a bag cutter or holder.

In summary, the Nesco VS-12 Deluxe is a powerhouse for sealing, while the FoodSaver VS-0160 is compact and budget-friendly. Your choice depends on your sealing needs and budget.
