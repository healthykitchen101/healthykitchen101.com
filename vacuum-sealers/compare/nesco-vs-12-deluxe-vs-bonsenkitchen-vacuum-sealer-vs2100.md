The Nesco VS-12 Deluxe Vacuum Sealer's top-tier performance places it ahead of the Bonsenkitchen Vacuum Sealer. It did so well, in fact, that it made the top of our best-to-buy list of vacuum sealers. Not only it’s easy to use with a comprehensive control panel, the VS-12 also has some of the best performances in our tests — the BonsenKitchen, realistically, didn’t quite stand a chance here.
