If you value vacuuming performance and usability, you’ll be happier with the FoodSaver VS-0160. Not only it scores higher in overall performance (8.1 vs 7.2) than the Inkbird Plus INK-VS01, it also has a better usability score thanks to a user-friendly control panel and intuitive design.

The FoodSaver is praised for its excellent vacuum sealing performance, well-built design, and relatively quiet operation. It is also beautifully designed and features a smoothly actuating lid with a storage lock​​.

The Inkbird, on the other hand, is recognized for its compact size, making it a great choice for those with limited countertop space. It also offers a built-in cutter, a feature not available in the FoodSaver model. However, it has a lower suction strength for moist foods and could benefit from improved safety features​​​​.
