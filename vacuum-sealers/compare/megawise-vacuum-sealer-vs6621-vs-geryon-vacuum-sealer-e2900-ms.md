The Megawise VS6621 vacuum sealer's standout feature is its compact form, being an inch slimmer than the GERYON 2900-MS, ideal for space-challenged countertops. However, the GERYON offers decent build quality with its removable lid for easy cleaning and a responsive control panel.

In terms of performance, both models score similarly, with the GERYON slightly edging ahead with a total performance score of 5.2, compared to the Megawise's 5.0, mainly because the Megawise didn't perform as well in the dry food test.

The choice comes down to your preference: if space-saving is crucial, opt for the Megawise VS6621; for a user-friendly experience, the GERYON E2900-MS is a solid choice.
