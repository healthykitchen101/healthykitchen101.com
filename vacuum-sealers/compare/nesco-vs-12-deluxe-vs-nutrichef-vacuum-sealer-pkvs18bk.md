Our performance tests showed that the Nesco VS-12 sealer is much more capable than the Nutrichef PKVS18BK. The Nesco VS-12 excels in both dry and moist food tests, boasting higher suction strength compared to the Nutriche.

The Nesco VS-12 also leads the scoreboard in terms of design and usability. It has far more premium housing, as well as better ease of use and safety than the Nutrichef PKVS18BK. This isn’t to say that the Nutrichef has bad design or usability, however. For the price, it’s still very good — just not quite as good as the Nesco VS-12!

The Nutrichef model offers a budget-friendly option without compromising on essential features for those looking to save. However, if you seek advanced performance, the Nesco VS-12 emerges as the more capable (albeit pricier) choice.
