The Nutrichef PKVS18BK comes out on top in this pairing with a better suction performance. We also had an easier time using the Nutrichef, thanks to the intuitive touch-based design. To be more specific, while the PKVS128BK’s suction power is only considered passable in our database, it’s still much higher than the BonsenKitchen VS-2100, which failed our tests. This, coupled with its better-looking design makes the Nutrichef PKVS18BK an easy recommendation.
