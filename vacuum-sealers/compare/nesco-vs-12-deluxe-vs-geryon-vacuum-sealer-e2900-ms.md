The Nesco VS-12 consistently earns a spot in top product listings. Not only does it feature a highly durable housing and well-built design, but our reviewers also found its suction performance to be impressive. It excelled in both our dry and moist food tests. In contrast, the GERYON E2900-MS didn't perform well in the dry food test and received only a moderate total performance score in our evaluations.

Despite the Nesco VS-12 being nearly twice as expensive as the GERYON E2900-MS, we are confident that it represents a significant and worthwhile upgrade, especially if you require more advanced suction performance than what the GERYON E2900-MS can provide as an entry-level vacuum sealer.
