In our full-scale lab tests, the FoodSaver VS-0160 consistently outshone competitors like the CALOTO AP-12X across various metrics, like performance, design, and usability. Its superior sealing capability (scoring 8.3 in our test) makes it a preferred choice among consumers seeking good sealing performance. Despite having a bulkier construction than the CALOTO, the FoodSaver VS-0160 more than makes up for it with great build quality. All this, in addition to being very easy to use, makes the FoodSaver VS-0160 an easy recommendation over the CALOTO.
