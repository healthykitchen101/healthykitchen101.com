The Inkbird INK-VS01 boasts excellent performance for its compact size, which allows it to excel in our dry and moist food tests. The sealer has a small form factor that uses up very little space on the countertop, plus, the build quality is very decent for the price. On top of the lid is a built-in cutter for greater convenience.

The Mueller also has a decent build with good safety features and bright indicator lights. However, its performance is mediocre compared to the Inkbird, and there are several issues with its design: the lid hinges are creaky, the lid locks are uneven, and the control panel’s buttons aren’t reliable. creaky lid hinges, uneven lid locks, and unreliable control panel buttons.

As such, the Inkbird will make for a better purchase — but in case it’s out of your budget range, the Mueller will be a passable stand-in, being a fraction the price of the Inkbird.
