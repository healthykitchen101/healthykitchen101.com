The FoodSaver VS-0160 was featured in our best-to-buy list due to its high performance and quality build. This model, despite being an entry-level product in FoodSaverâ€™s portfolio, does a great job in both our design assessments with its beautiful, well-built housing as well as our performance tests. In contrast, the Bonsenkitchen VS-2100 struggles with mediocre performance and lower build quality despite being a touch cheaper.
