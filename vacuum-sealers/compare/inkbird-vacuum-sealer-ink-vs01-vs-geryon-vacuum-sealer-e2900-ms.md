The standout feature of the Inkbird INK-VS01 is its compact design, measuring just 3.3 inches in width, which is half the size of most full-size vacuum sealers that typically exceed 5 inches. This compact size makes it a great fit for even the most crowded countertops. Additionally, it delivers strong suction performance relative to its size, making it a popular choice.

However, given its mid-range price, budget-conscious shoppers often consider alternatives like the GERYON E2900-MS. The GERYON has a wider and less premium plastic construction and falls short in suction performance, scoring only 5.2 out of 10 in our tests, while the Inkbird scores 7.2.

Considering these factors, the Inkbird INK-VS01 appears to be the superior choice in nearly every aspect compared to the GERYON.
