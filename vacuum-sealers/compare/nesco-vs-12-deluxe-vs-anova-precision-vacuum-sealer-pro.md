Both the Nesco VS-12 and the Anova Precision Vacuum Sealer Pro are featured on our list of the best vacuum sealers in 2023, as such, this is a fairly tough comparison to make.

Still, our data shows that the Nesco VS-12 exhibits stronger vacuum-sealing performance than the Anova. It’s backed by a score of 8.5 in overall performance, slightly edging out the Anova's 7.8​​.

Design-wise, both sealers are nearly equal. They share excellent top marks in build quality, control panel, and lid design​​. However, the Nesco VS-12’s wide array of extra features, like bag hooks and so on gives it a slight advantage over the Anova​​ in this section.

The Nesco slightly outperforms Anova in usability, too, due to having a more comprehensive control panel and a much easier user experience.

Overall, the Nesco VS-12 seems to offer better value for the money in all aspects.
