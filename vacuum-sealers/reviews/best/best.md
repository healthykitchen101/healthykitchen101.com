When you want to keep your food fresh for a longer time without freezing it, you can use a vacuum sealer. This machine sucks out the air around your food, effectively [slowing down the spoiling process](https://ask.usda.gov/s/article/What-is-vacuum-packaging). By vacuum-sealing your food, it can stay good in your pantry for a lot longer. For example, meat and fresh fruits can last a few extra days, while tougher foods like grains can last for weeks or even months. If you like to cook with sous vide, a vacuum sealer can be a very useful tool in your kitchen.

At Healthy Kitchen 101, we've tested many different vacuum sealers to see how well they work. You can read about the best ones in our report!

How We Test
-----------

To test the vacuum sealers’ performance, we put each model through two tests.

In the **“**[**dry food test**](https://healthykitchen101.com/vacuum-sealers/tests/dry-food/)**,”** we vacuum-seal 2.2 pounds (1 kilogram) of **black rice** grains in a pre-cut bag, while monitoring **suction strength** and **sealing time** — which are the two primary scoring criteria. The noise level of the sealer is also closely measured, although this data is only used as a reference and is not a scoring factor.

In the **“**[**moist food test,**](https://healthykitchen101.com/vacuum-sealers/tests/moist-food/)**”** we vacuum-seal 12.4 ounces (350 grams) of **fresh mango slices**, following a similar process: suction strength and sealing time are tracked for scoring, and noise level is measured for reference.

We also look at how well the sealers are made and how they look. The better they do in this part of the test, the longer they should last. We check things like the **vacuum channel**, **control panel**, **lid**, and any **extra features** they have.

Lastly, we check how easy it is to use them. Our reviewers think about things like **how easy they are to use**, if they have **safety features**, **how loud they are**, and if they have **indicators or alert chimes** that make them easier to use.

How We Picked
-------------

We tested each vacuum sealer in this list very thoroughly using our testing methodology. The ones that did better in our tests are the ones we recommend the most. Our method checks everything about the product, from how well it works to how it looks and how easy it is to use. This way, you can learn a lot about the product even if you don't have it with you.

Our Top Picks
-------------

In our latest batch of vacuum sealers, our reviewers have singled out three noteworthy models:

The Competition
---------------

*   **Inkbird Plus INK-VS01:** Compact and reasonably priced, the Inkbird Plus INK-VS01 is the ideal choice if you're looking for something more lightweight and with a smaller countertop footprint compared to the other three options. Despite its small size, the INK-VS01 performed quite well in our tests. It even includes a built-in bag cutter on the top lid for added convenience.
*   **Megawise VS6621:** Even more budget-friendly than the Inkbird is the Megawise VS6621. At a fraction of the price, the VS6621 provides just as many features, including a built-in bag cutter. As anticipated, the suction performance is, at best, mediocre, but it should still suffice if you're not expecting high performance from your sealer.

Things to Consider when Buying a New Vacuum Sealer
--------------------------------------------------

To find a good vacuum sealer that suits your budget as well as your needs, you have to pay attention to a couple of things while you’re browsing.

Suction performance and build quality are obviously important, but it’s very hard to tell without the product on hand. To complicate it even further, many manufacturers don’t disclose the specs of their products, which makes it even harder to compare one model’s suction to another. That’s where our reviews will be of most use to you.

In the meantime, you can take a look at the control panel and see how easily and intuitive it’s arranged. Check if they have extra features, such as a built-in bag cutter and storage compartment. Some models, like the Nesco VS-12, offer an LCD screen to track sealing progress. Most sealers will also come with a bundle of accessories, it’ll also be worth checking if it comes with everything you need. And last but not least, see the warranty information. The longer, the better.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
---------------------------------

**What’s the point of the dry and moist food settings?**

For dry foods, the sealer will typically go all-out with its suction power. But when it comes to moist food, there’s a chance that liquid can be sucked into the sealer. Cool liquid can also make it harder for the heat bar to seal the bag. In moist food mode, the sealer will work at reduced power for longer to create a tighter, better seal.

**Is there any food that you can’t vacuum seal?**

Cruciferous vegetables like cauliflowers and cabbages are out of the question. As they ripen, they release a gas, which will quickly fill up the bag and cause spoilage. Onions, garlic, and mushrooms are also not recommended due to [the higher risk of botulinum](https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/vacuum-sealed-food-what-are-the-food-safety-concerns#:~:text=There%20is%20a%20heightened%20danger,bakery%20foods%20and%20liquid%20products.). You also shouldn’t vacuum seal any food with an organic component, like blue cheese. The beneficial mold on the cheese will die without oxygen, essentially ruining it.

**Can you use a vacuum sealer with a plastic bag?**

Typically, plastic bags from different manufacturers have different sizes and thicknesses and are designed to be sealed at different temperatures. So, it’s still best to buy bags straight from the manufacturer. However, third-party bags work most of the time, too, though the sealing performance can be hit-or-miss. Experiment with third-party bags carefully and check for leaks before you use them to seal any delicate foods.

**Can vacuum packing eliminate bacteria?**

No, vacuum-packing your food without sanitizing it beforehand [won’t fully remove the risk of bacterial growth](https://ask.usda.gov/s/article/Can-I-keep-meat-in-vacuum-packages-at-room-temperature).
