### Dry Food Test

Suction Mode: Normal

Food Mode: Dry

Recorded Suction: 78 kPA (1) - 80 kPA (2)

Suction Time: 29s (1) - 27s (2)

As of November 2023, there’s no other vacuum sealer in our database able to achieve higher suction than the Nesco VS-12 in the dry food test. Our vacuum gauge recorded a peak suction between 78 to 80 kPA through two separate tests. Working time is relatively long, lasting from 27 to 29 seconds from session-to-session, but the high performance of the sealer means you’ll always get tightly-packed food every single time.

### Moist Food Test

The Nesco VS-12 during a moist food test packaging fresh mango slices. The peak suction strength recorded was 70 kPA in 36 seconds.

Suction Mode: Gentle

Food Mode: Moist

Recorded Suction: 52 kPA (1) - 70 kPA (2)

Suction Time: 38s (1) - 36s (2)

Even when set to the "Gentle" suction mode, the Nesco VS-12 consistently outperformed the majority of other models we've evaluated in our moist food test. During two separate test sessions, each lasting 38 and 36 seconds respectively, the VS-12 achieved peak suctions of 52 and 70 kPA.

Remarkably, even with the significantly stronger suction in the second test, the fresh mango slices we used were not crushed to the point where their juice was squeezed out. Needless to say, the sealer was able to extract almost all air from the bags.

Design

You can see the vacuum channel and the vacuum bag roll holder. Towards the front is the heating bar with a high-vis orange strip." width="300px" height="200px">

The Nesco VS-12 boasts outstanding build quality, earning a perfect score in this assessment from our reviewers. Its housing is mostly crafted from lightweight black plastic, but the sealer featured metallic plating on the top lid and front section—areas most susceptible to impacts and physical damage. This design choice gives us quite a lot of confidence in the Nesco VS-12's long-term durability.

Inside, the sealer is built from sturdy plastic. Near the front is the heat bar, responsible for sealing the bags. It performs well and has a high-visibility orange sticker strung across as a safety precaution.

### 10 - Control Panel

Button Type: Physical

Numberof Buttons: 6

Numberof Modes: 5

The control panel on the Nesco VS-12 stands out as the most user-friendly and feature-packed among all the models we've tried. It's designed with simplicity in mind, featuring just six buttons and a small LED strip that you can use to track the sealer’s working progress.

When it comes to sealing your food, this machine gives you the flexibility you need. You can select the "Sealing" mode based on the type of food you're packaging, whether it's dry or moist. For an extra-strong seal, there's even a "Double" option that creates two sealing marks for added security.

For foods with different textures, you have the choice of "Normal" or "Gentle" pressure modes, ensuring that even delicate items are sealed with care.

To the right of the control panel, you have the power to decide how the sealer operates. You can opt for automatic vacuum-and-seal, making the process effortless, or you can choose to manually seal your items for more control.

Furthermore, if you have unique sealing needs, such as sealing through an accessory air hose or sealing with marinades, this machine has dedicated buttons to cater to those specific requirements. It's truly a versatile and user-friendly sealing solution for all your food storage needs.

### 10 - Lid

Lid Lock: Handle lock

The Nesco VS-12's lid is solid and easy to use. There's a handle at the front that you lift to unlock and open the lid, and when it's time to seal, simply bring the lid down and push it to lock it securely in place. This handle lock feature makes using the sealer one-handed a breeze.

We've tested the hinges thoroughly, and they're strong. The lid stays firmly in place and doesn't wobble even when shaken. You can trust the Nesco VS-12 for stable and reliable sealing.

Despite its advanced control system, the Nesco VS-12 vacuum sealer remains user-friendly with clearly labeled buttons and an LED progress panel. Safety is not an issue with this unit, with warning stickers for hot spots, and its noise level matches competitors with even weaker performance. Bright indicator lights are visible in various lighting conditions.

Our team noted the Nesco VS-12 for its user-friendliness, despite having a fairly elaborate control panel. All the buttons are clearly labeled and intuitively indicate their functions. If you've used a vacuum sealer before, you won't even need to look at the user guide and can get to using it right away without any confusion. And if you're new to vacuum sealers, you'll quickly get the hang of it in just a few minutes.

The handle lock mechanism in particular makes it effortless to operate the sealer, even if you have one hand occupied.

Because of these factors, our reviewers gave the Nesco VS-12 an outstanding score in this regard.

### 10 - Safety & Noise

The Nesco VS-12 is on the louder side. According to our noise level meter, the suction motor could get as loud as 83.4 dBA, like during this dry food test.

Maximum Noise Level: 83.4 dBA

Safety is a top priority with the Nesco VS-12. The heating bar, which can get quite hot after a few cycles, is covered by a bright orange sticker for clear visibility, serving as a warning to users. Moreover, there's a "Hot Surface" label on the front of the machine for added caution.

In terms of noise, it registers at 83.4 dBA during the dry food test. While it's on the louder side compared to other models in our database, it's still within the normal range.

### 9.5 - Indicator Lights and Chime

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/nesco-vs-12-deluxe-vacuum-sealer-indicator-lights-clpgkfg2h001wmm88bjwv528i.jpg" alt="The small LED screen that indicates the sealer’s progress on the control panel." width="300px" height="200px">

Numberof Indicators: 9

Progress Bar: Yes

Chime: No

Excluding the LED screen used for tracking sealing progress, there are a total of nine indicator lights on the control panel of the Nesco VS-12. These lights are bright and remain clearly visible even in a studio with harsh lighting.

While the Nesco VS-12 doesn't have a traditional audible chime, it does produce a subtle hissing sound once the sealing process is finished, which can serve as a charming alternative "chime."
