The Nesco VS-12 is undoubtedly one of the best vacuum sealers you can find for your money. Not only does it deliver strong sealing performance, but it also boasts a robust build and a range of built-in features, including a convenient internal bag holding compartment and an integrated cutter. Despite its control panel looking somewhat complex with numerous functions and buttons, it's surprisingly user-friendly.

These factors are precisely why the Nesco VS-12 has secured the number one spot on our list of the best vacuum sealers!

**Things We Like**

*   Strong performance in both dry and moist food tests
*   Well-built design
*   Intuitive control panel with an LCD screen for progress tracking
*   Comes with a bag roll compartment and bag cutter

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Doesn’t come with a chime

At a brief glance, the elaborate control panel and the hefty size of the Nesco VS-12 alone is already indicative of its potentials. So when we put it to the test in the lab, we weren’t very surprised when the Nesco VS-12 excelled in virtually all categories, from performance to design and usability.

performance Scores: **8.5**

*   Dry Food Test (60%) - **8.8**/10
    
*   Moist Food Test (40%) - **8.0**/10
    

The Nesco VS-12 achieved one of the highest performance ratings in our vacuum sealer tests. It consistently scored no lower than 8.0 in both dry and moist tests. The result is an impressive overall performance score of 8.5/10.

### Dry Food Test

Suction Mode: Normal

Food Mode: Dry

Recorded Suction: 78 kPA (1) - 80 kPA (2)

Suction Time: 29s (1) - 27s (2)

As of November 2023, there’s no other vacuum sealer in our database able to achieve higher suction than the Nesco VS-12 in the dry food test. Our vacuum gauge recorded a peak suction between 78 to 80 kPA through two separate tests. Working time is relatively long, lasting from 27 to 29 seconds from session-to-session, but the high performance of the sealer means you’ll always get tightly-packed food every single time.

### Moist Food Test

Suction Mode: Gentle

Food Mode: Moist

Recorded Suction: 52 kPA (1) - 70 kPA (2)

Suction Time: 38s (1) - 36s (2)

Even when set to the "Gentle" suction mode, the Nesco VS-12 consistently outperformed the majority of other models we've evaluated in our moist food test. During two separate test sessions, each lasting 38 and 36 seconds respectively, the VS-12 achieved peak suctions of 52 and 70 kPA.

Remarkably, even with the significantly stronger suction in the second test, the fresh mango slices we used were not crushed to the point where their juice was squeezed out. Needless to say, the sealer was able to extract almost all air from the bags.

Design
------

design Scores: **0.0**

The Nesco VS-12 stands out thanks to its sturdy design, which earned it high praise from our reviewers.

As a result, the unit achieved an impressive score of 9.0/10 in this category.
