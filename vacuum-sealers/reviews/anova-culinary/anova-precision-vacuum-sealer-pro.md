The Anova Precision Pro sealer shines in terms of performance. It excelled in the dry food test, although it had a somewhat average score in the moist food test. Nevertheless, it earned a respectable total performance score of 8.0/10.

### Dry Food Test

It achieved a peak suction of 67 kPA in 14 seconds." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/anova-precision-vacuum-sealer-pro-dry-food-test-clpgabkbn0011mm886iqh5jxh.jpg" alt="The Anova Precision Pro performing the second dry test. Peak suction was still at 67 kPA according to our vacuum gauge and the sealer finished its working cycle in precisely 14 seconds like before." width="300px" height="200px">

Suction Mode: N/A

Food Mode: Dry

Suction Strength: 67 kPA (1) - 67 kPA (2)

Cycle Time: 14s (1) - 14s (2)

The Anova Precision Pro performed exceptionally well in the dry food test. We tested its vacuum-sealing capabilities by using it to vacuum-pack a bag of black rice grains.

Surprisingly, the Anova Precision Pro achieved a peak suction of 67 kPA and finished a cycle time of 14 seconds in both consecutive tests. This just goes on to demonstrate just how reliable and consistent the sealer’s performance is.

Overall, the Anova received an impressive score of 8.85 out of 10 in this portion of the test.

### Moist Food Test

It achieved a peak suction of 45 kPA in a working cycle lasting 41 seconds." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/anova-precision-vacuum-sealer-pro-moist-food-test-1-clpgadxvf0013mm88hmnwbjuf.jpg" alt="The Anova Precision Pro as it is performing the second moist food test. It achieved a peak 43 kPA suction power in a working cycle lasting 39 seconds." width="300px" height="200px">

Suction Mode: N/A

Food Mode: Moist

Suction Strength: 45 kPA (1) - 43 kPA (2)

Cycle Time: 41s (1) - 39s (2)

When switched to 'Moist' food mode, the Anova Precision Pro's suction power is halved, and the working cycle significantly lengthens.

The initial test took 41 seconds to vacuum-pack a bag of fresh mango slices, achieving a peak suction of 45 kPA. The second test took 39 seconds to achieve a peak suction of 43 kPA.

Despite not crushing the fruit slices to the point of them leaking out the juice in both tests, the extended working time is a notable drawback. Consequently, the Anova scored only 5.8/10 in this section.

The Anova Precision Pro vacuum sealer stands out with its sleek black plastic design that adds a touch of elegance to any kitchen. It's well-built, easy to use with one hand thanks to the handle lock, and features a user-friendly control panel with just a few buttons. It even has some handy extras, like a compartment for holding plastic bag rolls and a built-in cutter.

### In the Box

The Anova Precision Pro comes in the box with the following items:

*   A roll of plastic bag
*   Accessory air hose
*   User manual

### Dimensions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/anova-precision-vacuum-sealer-pro-dimensions-clphq5ec80020mm88fdi13a5b.jpg" alt="The Anova Precision Pro, being a full-size vacuum sealer, may take up quite a lot of countertop space with a length of 15.5 inches, a width of 7.1 inches, and a height of 4.3 inches." width="300px" height="200px">

Weight: 5.0 lbs (2.3 kg)

Length: 15.5" (39.4 cm)

Width: 7.1" (18.0 cm)

Height: 4.3" (10.9 cm)

Being classified as a "full-size" model in our database, the Anova Precision Pro does come with a substantial size and weight, partly due to the spacious compartment inside for storing the plastic bag roll.

However, when compared to other full-size models like the Nesco VS-12, it’s neither too bulky or heavier than average. But it definitely can’t go toe-to-toe with vacuum sealers like the Megawise VS6621 in terms of compactness.

### 10 - Build Quality

It has non-slip feet in all four corners, as well as a small compartment near the back to tuck the power cord inside for easier storage." width="300px" height="200px">

While the Anova Precision Pro is constructed entirely from plastic, it doesn't come across as cheap in any way. It boasts an elegant all-black design that blends both matte and glossy plastic, creating a high-end appearance. Every component inside and outside the sealer is very well crafted, from the sturdy locking mechanisms to the replaceable foam seal encircling the vacuum channel. This seal plays a crucial role in maintaining an airtight seal for the channel to work.

On the bottom of the sealer, you'll find non-slip feet and a handy compartment to neatly store the power cord, making it more convenient for storage.

All in all, we have little doubt that the vacuum sealer will last a long time with minimal maintenance needed.

### 10 - Control Panel

Button Type: Physical

Number of Buttons: 7

Number of Modes: 2

The control panel of the Anova Precision Pro has a sleek and simple design. It features just seven buttons arranged in a row, organized into three distinct groups based on their functions.

Starting from the left, the first group includes the "Vacuum & Seal" button, along with two additional buttons that let you select the specific food mode for sealing.

In the center, you'll find the second group of buttons, which are designed for more specialized tasks. The "Seal" button allows you to seal the bag using the heating bar without vacuuming it. Alternatively, you can engage the "Pulse Vacuum" mode by pressing and holding the button, giving you the flexibility to control the vacuum process. Simply release your finger from the button whenever you want to stop the vacuum.

Finally, on the far right side, there's the "External Pulse Vacuum" button, which comes in handy when you want to vacuum-pack using an air hose adapter.

### 10 - Lid

These can be operated by lifting or pressing down on the handle above." width="300px" height="200px">

Lid Lock: Handle lock

The lid of the Anova Precision Pro is really well-made. We checked the lid hinges thoroughly, and they are as solid as a rock. Even when we moved the lid from side to side, it didn't shift or wobble.

You'll notice a handle at the front of the unit, and it's used to work the locking system. To unlock the lid, just lift the handle. When you're ready to close the lid, push down the handle to secure the locks. This handle lock feature makes operating the sealer super easy, even if you use it with just one hand.

### 8.0 - Extra Features

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/anova-precision-vacuum-sealer-pro-extra-features-clpgb57e2001dmm883vvbe2xb.jpg" alt="Inside the Anova Precision Pro is a large compartment that you can use to store a roll of plastic bag. There is a flip-down cutter for you to cut out any length of bag that you want." width="300px" height="200px">

Bag Cutter: Yes

Bag Holder: Yes

Bag Hooks: Yes

Removable Drip Tray: No

The Anova Precision Pro includes a handy interior compartment where you can store a roll of plastic bags. Inside this compartment, there's a convenient flip-down cutter that makes it easy for you to cut out sections of the plastic bags as needed.

It also comes with a pair of small bag hooks within the vacuum channel, which also makes feeding new bags into the sealer easier.

The only thing it doesn’t have is a removable drip tray.

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **8.7**

*   Ease of Use (70%) - **9.0**/10
    
*   Safety & Noise (15%) - **9.0**/10
    
*   Indicator Lights and Chime (15%) - **7.0**/10
    

The Anova Precision Pro excels in usability. Its user-friendly control panel is complemented by thoughtful safety features, such as the handle lock and a visible warning strip on the hot heating bar. However, it could benefit from an audible chime for added ease of use.

### 9.0 - Ease of Use

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/anova-precision-vacuum-sealer-pro-ease-use-clpgd11sy001fmm88ddzn92ha.jpg" alt="The lid and the handle lock are easy to operate with just one hand." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/anova-precision-vacuum-sealer-pro-ease-use-1-clpgd1z7e001gmm883pi68tvf.jpg" alt="The Anova Precision Pro has a handle lock, which greatly simplifies the operation of the sealer and enables one-handed lid locking and release." width="300px" height="200px">

The Anova Precision Pro is incredibly user-friendly. You won't need to dive into the user manual because the control panel is straightforward, with clearly labeled buttons. Using the sealer is a breeze, thanks to the convenient handle lock that allows you to open and close the lid quickly and easily.

However, we encountered a minor issue in this aspect: our reviewers discovered that unless you press down on the handle right in the center, the locks won't engage properly (the handle may bend and not click into place correctly). This doesn't significantly affect the overall user experience and becomes less of an annoyance once you're accustomed to using the Anova. However, initially, it can be a bit bothersome, especially if you prefer one-handed operation.

Just press the right button on the control panel to start the sealing process, and it starts right away. That's why our reviewers gave it top marks for user-friendliness.

### 9.0 - Safety & Noise

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/anova-precision-vacuum-sealer-pro-noise-clpgd66ua001hmm88fype0m1d.jpg" alt="Anova has thoughtfully included a bright, high-vis orange sticker across the heating bar as a safety precaution." width="300px" height="200px">

Anova has thoughtfully included a bright, high-vis orange sticker across the heating bar as a safety precaution.

Maximum Noise Level: 83 dBA

Above the hot heating bar, there's a noticeable bright orange sticker. This serves as a clear warning for new users, indicating the location of the hot heating bar to help them avoid accidental contact. Given the sealer's sleek all-black design, without this sticker, it would be challenging for users to identify the heating bar's position.

When it comes to noise, the Anova Precision Pro is on par with other sealers we've tested. It reached a peak noise level of 83 dBA during a dry food test.

### 7.0 - Indicator Lights and Chime

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/anova-precision-vacuum-sealer-pro-indicator-lights-clpgd7wr9001imm88a3a62xc2.jpg" alt="The indicator lights are built into the individual button. The Dry vacuuming mode is on at the moment." width="300px" height="200px">

Numberof Indicators: 9

Progress Bar: Yes

Chime: No

The Anova Precision Pro's control panel has buttons with indicator lights that light up and blink to show your selected food or mode. Unfortunately, these lights are quite dim, making them hard to see in our well-lit lab. If your kitchen gets a lot of sunlight, it could be a challenge to read what the control panel says.

This model doesn’t come with an audible chime, so you have to rely entirely on the lights to know when it’s finished its working cycle.
