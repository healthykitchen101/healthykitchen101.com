The Anova Precision Vacuum Sealer Pro is one of our top picks for vacuum sealers in 2023 because it performs well, looks great, and is easy to use. However, when compared to some other options like the Nesco VS-12, it may not be the absolute best choice in terms of performance and durability.

That said, if you're looking for a sleek and convenient vacuum sealer to use for tasks like sealing sous vide meals or storing food, the Anova Precision Pro should work just fine.

Performance

performance Scores: **7.6**

*   Dry Food Test (60%) - **8.8**/10
    
*   Moist Food Test (40%) - **5.8**/10
    

The Anova Precision Pro sealer shines in terms of performance. It excelled in the dry food test, although it had a somewhat average score in the moist food test. Nevertheless, it earned a respectable total performance score of 8.0/10.

### Dry Food Test

Suction Mode: N/A

Food Mode: Dry

Recorded Suction: 67 kPA (1) - 67 kPA (2)

Suction Time: 14s (1) - 14s (2)

The Anova Precision Pro performed exceptionally well in the dry food test. We tested its vacuum-sealing capabilities by using it to vacuum-pack a bag of black rice grains.

Surprisingly, the Anova Precision Pro achieved a peak suction of 67 kPA and finished a cycle time of 14 seconds in both consecutive tests. This just goes on to demonstrate just how reliable and consistent the sealer’s performance is.

Overall, the Anova received an impressive score of 8.85 out of 10 in this portion of the test.

### Moist Food Test

Suction Mode: N/A

Food Mode: Moist

Recorded Suction: 45 kPA (1) - 43 kPA (2)

Suction Time: 41s (1) - 39s (2)

When switched to 'Moist' food mode, the Anova Precision Pro's suction power is halved, and the working cycle significantly lengthens.

The initial test took 41 seconds to vacuum-pack a bag of fresh mango slices, achieving a peak suction of 45 kPA. The second test took 39 seconds to achieve a peak suction of 43 kPA.

Despite not crushing the fruit slices to the point of them leaking out the juice in both tests, the extended working time is a notable drawback. Consequently, the Anova scored only 5.8/10 in this section.

The Anova Precision Pro vacuum sealer stands out with its sleek black plastic design that adds a touch of elegance to any kitchen. It's well-built, easy to use with one hand thanks to the handle lock, and features a user-friendly control panel with just a few buttons. It even has some handy extras, like a compartment for holding plastic bag rolls and a built-in cutter.

### 10 - Build Quality

Even though the Anova Precision Pro is built entirely from plastic, it neither looks nor feels cheap. Painted all-black from top to bottom, its exterior is a mix of premium-looking matte and glossy plastic, which gives it a fairly expensive look.

### 10 - Control Panel

Button Type: Physical

Numberof Buttons: 7

Numberof Modes: 2

The control panel of the Anova Precision Pro has a sleek and simple design. It features just seven buttons arranged in a row, organized into three distinct groups based on their functions.

Starting from the left, the first group includes the "Vacuum & Seal" button, along with two additional buttons that let you select the specific food mode for sealing.

In the center, you'll find the second group of buttons, which are designed for more specialized tasks. The "Seal" button allows you to seal the bag using the heating bar without vacuuming it. Alternatively, you can engage the "Pulse Vacuum" mode by pressing and holding the button, giving you the flexibility to control the vacuum process. Simply release your finger from the button whenever you want to stop the vacuum.

Finally, on the far right side, there's the "External Pulse Vacuum" button, which comes in handy when you want to vacuum-pack using an air hose adapter.
