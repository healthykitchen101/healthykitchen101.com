The Anova Precision Vacuum Sealer Pro is one of our top picks for vacuum sealers in 2023 because it performs well, looks great, and is easy to use. However, when compared to some other options like the Nesco VS-12, it may not be the absolute best choice in terms of performance and durability.

That said, if you're looking for a sleek and convenient vacuum sealer to use for tasks like sealing sous vide meals or storing food, the Anova Precision Pro should work just fine.

### Dry Food Test

The Anova Precision Pro performing the second dry test. Peak suction was still at 67 kPA according to our vacuum gauge and the sealer finished its working cycle in precisely 14 seconds like before.

Suction Mode: N/A

Food Mode: Dry

Recorded Suction: 67 kPA (1) - 67 kPA (2)

Suction Time: 14s (1) - 14s (2)

The Anova Precision Pro performed exceptionally well in the dry food test. We tested its vacuum-sealing capabilities by using it to vacuum-pack a bag of black rice grains.

Surprisingly, the Anova Precision Pro achieved a peak suction of 67 kPA and finished a cycle time of 14 seconds in both consecutive tests. This just goes on to demonstrate just how reliable and consistent the sealer’s performance is.

Overall, the Anova received an impressive score of 8.85 out of 10 in this portion of the test.

### Moist Food Test

Suction Mode: N/A

Food Mode: Moist

Recorded Suction: 45 kPA (1) - 43 kPA (2)

Suction Time: 41s (1) - 39s (2)

When switched to 'Moist' food mode, the Anova Precision Pro's suction power is halved, and the working cycle significantly lengthens.

The initial test took 41 seconds to vacuum-pack a bag of fresh mango slices, achieving a peak suction of 45 kPA. The second test took 39 seconds to achieve a peak suction of 43 kPA.

Despite not crushing the fruit slices to the point of them leaking out the juice in both tests, the extended working time is a notable drawback. Consequently, the Anova scored only 5.8/10 in this section.

Design
------

design Scores: **9.0**

*   Build Quality (50%) - **10**/10
    
*   Control Panel (20%) - **10**/10
    
*   Lid (20%) - **10**/10
    

The Anova Precision Pro vacuum sealer stands out with its sleek black plastic design that adds a touch of elegance to any kitchen. It's well-built, easy to use with one hand thanks to the handle lock, and features a user-friendly control panel with just a few buttons. It even has some handy extras, like a compartment for holding plastic bag rolls and a built-in cutter.

### 10 - Build Quality

Even though the Anova Precision Pro is built entirely from plastic, it neither looks nor feels cheap. Painted all-black from top to bottom, its exterior is a mix of premium-looking matte and glossy plastic, which gives it a fairly expensive look.

### 10 - Control Panel

Button Type: Physical

Numberof Buttons: 7

Numberof Modes: 2

The control panel of the Anova Precision Pro has a sleek and simple design. It features just seven buttons arranged in a row, organized into three distinct groups based on their functions.

Starting from the left, the first group includes the "Vacuum & Seal" button, along with two additional buttons that let you select the specific food mode for sealing.

In the center, you'll find the second group of buttons, which are designed for more specialized tasks. The "Seal" button allows you to seal the bag using the heating bar without vacuuming it. Alternatively, you can engage the "Pulse Vacuum" mode by pressing and holding the button, giving you the flexibility to control the vacuum process. Simply release your finger from the button whenever you want to stop the vacuum.

Finally, on the far right side, there's the "External Pulse Vacuum" button, which comes in handy when you want to vacuum-pack using an air hose adapter.

### 10 - Lid

Lid Lock: Handle lock

The lid of the Anova Precision Pro is really well-made. We checked the lid hinges thoroughly, and they are as solid as a rock. Even when we moved the lid from side to side, it didn't shift or wobble.

You'll notice a handle at the front of the unit, and it's used to work the locking system. To unlock the lid, just lift the handle. When you're ready to close the lid, push down the handle to secure the locks. This handle lock feature makes operating the sealer super easy, even if you use it with just one hand.

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **9.6**

*   Ease of Use (70%) - **10**/10
    
*   Safety & Noise (15%) - **8.0**/10
    
*   Indicator Lights and Chime (15%) - **9.5**/10
    

The Anova Precision Pro excels in usability. Its user-friendly control panel is complemented by thoughtful safety features, such as the handle lock and a visible warning strip on the hot heating bar. However, it could benefit from an audible chime for added ease of use.

### 10 - Ease of Use

The Anova Precision Pro is incredibly user-friendly. You won't need to dig into the user manual because the control panel is straightforward, with well-labeled buttons. Using the sealer is a breeze, thanks to the handy handle lock that makes opening and closing the lid quick and easy. Just press the right button on the control panel to start the sealing process, and it starts right away. That's why our reviewers gave it top marks for user-friendliness.

### 8.0 - Safety & Noise

Maximum Noise Level: 83.4 dBA

Above the hot heating bar, there's a noticeable bright orange sticker. This serves as a clear warning for new users, indicating the location of the hot heating bar to help them avoid accidental contact. Given the sealer's sleek all-black design, without this sticker, it would be challenging for users to identify the heating bar's position.

When it comes to noise, the Anova Precision Pro is on par with other sealers we've tested. It reached a peak noise level of 83 dBA during a dry food test.

### 9.5 - Indicator Lights and Chime

Numberof Indicators: 9

Progress Bar: Yes

Chime: No

The Anova Precision Pro's control panel has buttons with indicator lights that light up and blink to show your selected food or mode. Unfortunately, these lights are quite dim, making them hard to see in our well-lit lab. If your kitchen gets a lot of sunlight, it could be a challenge to read what the control panel says.

This model doesn’t come with an audible chime, so you have to rely entirely on the lights to know when it’s finished its working cycle.
