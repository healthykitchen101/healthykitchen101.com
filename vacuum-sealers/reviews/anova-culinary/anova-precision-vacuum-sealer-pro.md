The Anova Precision Vacuum Sealer Pro is one of our top picks for vacuum sealers in 2023 because it performs well, looks great, and is easy to use. However, when compared to some other options like the Nesco VS-12, it may not be the absolute best choice in terms of performance and durability.

That said, if you're looking for a sleek and convenient vacuum sealer to use for tasks like sealing sous vide meals or storing food, the Anova Precision Pro should work just fine.

*   Moist Food Test (40%) - **5.8**/10
    

The Anova Precision Pro sealer shines in terms of performance. It excelled in the dry food test, although it had a somewhat average score in the moist food test. Nevertheless, it earned a respectable total performance score of 8.0/10.

### Dry Food Test

Suction Mode: N/A

Food Mode: Dry

Recorded Suction: 67 kPA (1) - 67 kPA (2)

Suction Time: 14s (1) - 14s (2)

The Anova Precision Pro performed exceptionally well in the dry food test. We tested its vacuum-sealing capabilities by using it to vacuum-pack a bag of black rice grains.

Surprisingly, the Anova Precision Pro achieved a peak suction of 67 kPA and finished a cycle time of 14 seconds in both consecutive tests. This just goes on to demonstrate just how reliable and consistent the sealer’s performance is.

Overall, the Anova received an impressive score of 8.85 out of 10 in this portion of the test.

### Moist Food Test

Suction Mode: N/A

Food Mode: Moist

Recorded Suction: 45 kPA (1) - 43 kPA (2)

Suction Time: 41s (1) - 39s (2)

When switched to 'Moist' food mode, the Anova Precision Pro's suction power is halved, and the working cycle significantly lengthens.

The initial test took 41 seconds to vacuum-pack a bag of fresh mango slices, achieving a peak suction of 45 kPA. The second test took 39 seconds to achieve a peak suction of 43 kPA.

Despite not crushing the fruit slices to the point of them leaking out the juice in both tests, the extended working time is a notable drawback. Consequently, the Anova scored only 5.8/10 in this section.
