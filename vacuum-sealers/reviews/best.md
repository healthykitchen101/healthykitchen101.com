When you want to keep your food fresh for a longer time without freezing it, you can use a vacuum sealer. This machine sucks out the air around your food, effectively [slowing down the spoiling process](https://ask.usda.gov/s/article/What-is-vacuum-packaging). By vacuum-sealing your food, it can stay good in your pantry for a lot longer. For example, meat and fresh fruits can last a few extra days, while tougher foods like grains can last for weeks or even months. If you like to cook with sous vide, a vacuum sealer can be a very useful tool in your kitchen.

At Healthy Kitchen 101, we've tested many different vacuum sealers to see how well they work. You can read about the best ones in our report!

How We Test
-----------

To test the vacuum sealers’ performance, we put each model through two tests.

In the **“**[**dry food test**](https://healthykitchen101.com/vacuum-sealers/tests/dry-food/)**,”** we vacuum-seal 2.2 pounds (1 kilogram) of **black rice** grains in a pre-cut bag, while monitoring **suction strength** and **sealing time** — which are the two primary scoring criteria. The noise level of the sealer is also closely measured, although this data is only used as a reference and is not a scoring factor.

In the **“**[**moist food test,**](https://healthykitchen101.com/vacuum-sealers/tests/moist-food/)**”** we vacuum-seal 12.4 ounces (350 grams) of **fresh mango slices**, following a similar process: suction strength and sealing time are tracked for scoring, and noise level is measured for reference.

We also look at how well the sealers are made and how they look. The better they do in this part of the test, the longer they should last. We check things like the **vacuum channel**, **control panel**, **lid**, and any **extra features** they have.

Lastly, we check how easy it is to use them. Our reviewers think about things like **how easy they are to use**, if they have **safety features**, **how loud they are**, and if they have **indicators or alert chimes** that make them easier to use.

How We Picked
-------------

We tested each vacuum sealer in this list very thoroughly using our testing methodology. The ones that did better in our tests are the ones we recommend the most. Our method checks everything about the product, from how well it works to how it looks and how easy it is to use. This way, you can learn a lot about the product even if you don't have it with you.

Our Top Picks
-------------

In our latest batch of vacuum sealers, our reviewers have singled out three noteworthy models:

1\. Best Overall: Nesco VS-12 Deluxe Vacuum Sealer

*   Strong performance in both dry and moist food tests
*   Well-built design
*   Intuitive control panel with an LCD screen for progress tracking
*   Comes with a bag roll compartment and bag cutter

*   Doesn’t come with a chime

The Nesco VS-12 did really well in our tests. It had strong suction when sealing both dry food (80 kPA) and moist food (70 kPA). It quickly removed air from dry food bags in just 17 seconds, and moist mode took a bit longer at 38 seconds. But the good news is that the fruit slices we used in the test stayed in good shape and weren't squished by the strong suction.\[3\] The Nesco VS-12 at the end of a moist food test

The Nesco VS-12 also got high marks for how it's built. It looks sturdy, has easy-to-use buttons and a little screen to show you what's happening, and a lid that locks securely with a handle. Inside, it has a place to hold the bag roll and a cutter for cutting bags.

Our reviewers found it easy to use because the buttons are clearly labeled, and the timer on the screen makes it easy to track progress. Safety is great with warning stickers around the heating bar, which can get hot after a few cycles. Even though it has strong suction, it's not much louder than other sealers we tested. It didn’t come with a chime, but the sounds of the lock disengaging and a small hiss of air rushing into the chamber would signal that the sealer had finished working.

2\. Best Runner-up: FoodSaver VS0100 Compact Vacuum Sealer

*   Decent performance in both dry and moist tests
*   Beautiful design for the price
*   Convenient storage lock
*   User-friendly control panel
*   Has a removable drip tray

*   Doesn’t have many extra features

Despite being the budget entrant to FoodSaver’s portfolio, the VS0100 doesn’t have the look of a cheap vacuum sealer. And when it’s put to the test, it’s also readily apparent that its performance isn’t to sneeze at, either.\[4\] The FoodSaver VS0100 performing a dry test

The FoodSaver VS-0100 performed well in our tests, although it didn't quite match up to the Nesco VS-12. In the dry food test, it achieved vacuum levels of 62-63 kPA, efficiently removing air from bags of black rice in just 11 seconds. In moist mode, it sealed fresh mango slices without squishing them, reaching a relatively gentle 45-58 kPA within 33-39 seconds.

Our reviewers were impressed with the design and build quality of the VS-0100. With a metallic top piece and a sleek, modern design, it’s quite hard to believe the VS-0100 is a budget pick. The control panel is minimalistic but clearly marked and user-friendly. The robust lid includes a unique storage lock to prevent accidental openings and, most notably, the sealer comes with a removable drip tray, which makes vacuum-packing moist or juicy food more convenient and safer.

Our reviewers found the sealer to be extremely user-friendly. Tasks like feeding the bag and working the lid are effortless. Safety is a minor concern due to the absence of warning stickers on and around the hot heating bar, but the risk isn’t too high. The motor noise, approximately 78 dBA, is acceptable and consistent with competitors. However, it lacks an audible alert when cycles finish, a slight drawback typical for a FoodSaver sealer in this price range.

3\. Best for Sous Vide: Anova Precision Vacuum Sealer Pro

Love to sous vide on the weekend? The Anova Precision Pro has everything that you need to pack up a prime cut of steak for dipping. The elegant design of the sealer also makes it a nice countertop piece!\[5\] The Anova Precision Pro during a moist test

The Anova Precision Pro was able to suck all air from out a bag of rice in 14-15 seconds using a powerful 67 kPA suction. It maintained a solid 43-45 kPA suction even in moist mode, completing a cycle in just 39 seconds. The sealer was gentle enough not to squish the delicate mango slices we used as test articles. But even if it did, the extra juices in the bag shouldn’t be a problem for the Precision Pro since it was rated to deal with liquid (this is why it comes to highly recommended sous vide cooking!)

In addition to its sleek and elegant design, our reviewers were impressed by the user-friendly control panel. There were only six buttons, all clearly labeled and easy to use. The well-built lid with sturdy hinges ensures stability, and the lid lock, which can be operated with one hand by flipping the front handle up and down, adds to the convenience. Inside, there's a nifty compartment for rolls of plastic bags, complete with a handy cutter.

Our reviewers particularly love the Precision Pro for its ease of use. You can perform every task with it using just one hand. Safety is great with warning stickers strategically placed inside the sealer. In terms of noise, the motor isn’t any louder (or quieter) than its peers in class. And while the indicator lights on the buttons are somewhat dim, they remain visible even in well-lit studios. Just remember that the sealer doesn't have a chime, so you'll need to keep an eye out for the flashing buttons to know when a cycle is complete.

The Competition
---------------

*   **Inkbird Plus INK-VS01:** Compact and reasonably priced, the Inkbird Plus INK-VS01 is the ideal choice if you're looking for something more lightweight and with a smaller countertop footprint compared to the other three options. Despite its small size, the INK-VS01 performed quite well in our tests. It even includes a built-in bag cutter on the top lid for added convenience.
*   **Megawise VS6621:** Even more budget-friendly than the Inkbird is the Megawise VS6621. At a fraction of the price, the VS6621 provides just as many features, including a built-in bag cutter. As anticipated, the suction performance is, at best, mediocre, but it should still suffice if you're not expecting high performance from your sealer.

Things to Consider when Buying a New Vacuum Sealer
--------------------------------------------------

To find a good vacuum sealer that suits your budget as well as your needs, you have to pay attention to a couple of things while you’re browsing.

Suction performance and build quality are obviously important, but it’s very hard to tell without the product on hand. To complicate it even further, many manufacturers don’t disclose the specs of their products, which makes it even harder to compare one model’s suction to another. That’s where our reviews will be of most use to you.

In the meantime, you can take a look at the control panel and see how easily and intuitive it’s arranged. Check if they have extra features, such as a built-in bag cutter and storage compartment. Some models, like the Nesco VS-12, offer an LCD screen to track sealing progress. Most sealers will also come with a bundle of accessories, it’ll also be worth checking if it comes with everything you need. And last but not least, see the warranty information. The longer, the better.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
---------------------------------

**What’s the point of the dry and moist food settings?**

For dry foods, the sealer will typically go all-out with its suction power. But when it comes to moist food, there’s a chance that liquid can be sucked into the sealer. Cool liquid can also make it harder for the heat bar to seal the bag. In moist food mode, the sealer will work at reduced power for longer to create a tighter, better seal.

**Is there any food that you can’t vacuum seal?**

Cruciferous vegetables like cauliflowers and cabbages are out of the question. As they ripen, they release a gas, which will quickly fill up the bag and cause spoilage. Onions, garlic, and mushrooms are also not recommended due to [the higher risk of botulinum](https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/vacuum-sealed-food-what-are-the-food-safety-concerns#:~:text=There%20is%20a%20heightened%20danger,bakery%20foods%20and%20liquid%20products.). You also shouldn’t vacuum seal any food with an organic component, like blue cheese. The beneficial mold on the cheese will die without oxygen, essentially ruining it.

**Can you use a vacuum sealer with a plastic bag?**

Typically, plastic bags from different manufacturers have different sizes and thicknesses and are designed to be sealed at different temperatures. So, it’s still best to buy bags straight from the manufacturer. However, third-party bags work most of the time, too, though the sealing performance can be hit-or-miss. Experiment with third-party bags carefully and check for leaks before you use them to seal any delicate foods.

**Can vacuum packing eliminate bacteria?**

No, vacuum-packing your food without sanitizing it beforehand [won’t fully remove the risk of bacterial growth](https://ask.usda.gov/s/article/Can-I-keep-meat-in-vacuum-packages-at-room-temperature).
