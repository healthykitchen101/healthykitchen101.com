The Mueller MV-1100 vacuum sealer presents a combination of strengths and weaknesses. In comparison to other vacuum sealers in our database, this model falls into the middle tier in terms of performance.

While it does offer a cost-effective choice within its category, its design, in particular, does not match up to the standards set by other [top-tier vacuum sealers](https://healthykitchen101.com/vacuum-sealers/reviews/best/) we've evaluated. Notably, the lid hinges produce an audible creak when in use, the locking mechanism can be finicky due to inconsistent alignment, and testing has revealed occasional reliability issues with the control panel.

**Things We Like**

*   Passable vacuum-packing performance for the money
*   Decent build quality
*   Good safety features
*   Bright indicator lights
*   Comes with a progress bar for easy tracking

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   The lid hinges creak when the lid is lifted or lowered
*   Uneven lid locks
*   Buttons on the control panel are unreliable

Mueller is a household name known for a wide range of kitchen tools, from knife sharpeners to toaster ovens. So, it’s not surprising that there’s a vacuum sealer in the mix: the Mueller MV-1100 automated food vacuum sealer.

For a week, we tested the MV-1100 sealer in our lab, carefully evaluating its performance, design, and ease of use. All of our findings can be found in this detailed report!

Performance
-----------

performance Scores: **6.0**

*   Dry Food Test (60%) - **5.8**/10
    
*   Moist Food Test (40%) - **6.5**/10
    

The performance of the Mueller vacuum sealer is underwhelming. It received mediocre scores in both dry and moist food tests. Although it managed to seal bags of dry food without leaving air bubbles and didn’t crush the fresh mango slices in the moist food test, our reviewers still found its performance lacking.

### Dry Food Test

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/mueller-vacuum-sealer-mv-1100-dry-food-test-clprtg40m0000pz88fj6u7px3.jpg" alt="The Mueller MV-1100 vacuum sealer demonstrating peak suction of 46 kPA in an 18-second dry food test." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/mueller-vacuum-sealer-mv-1100-dry-food-test-1-clprthtra0001pz887c7ka8ll.jpg" alt="The Mueller MV-1100 vacuum sealer during the second dry food test. It achieved a peak suction power of 47 kPA over a 22-second working cycle." width="300px" height="200px">

Suction Mode: Airtight

Food Mode: Dry

Suction Strength: 46 kPA (1) - 47 kPA (2)

Cycle Time: 18s (1) - 22s (2)

The Mueller achieved a consistent suction power of 46-47 kPa in two test sessions, as measured by our vacuum gauge. However, our timer showed a slight discrepancy in working time, with the first session taking 18 seconds and the second session taking 22 seconds. The time difference is insignificant, but it contributed to the Mueller's lower score in this test.

### Moist Food Test

It achieved a suction peak of 30 kPA over a 25-second working cycle." width="300px" height="200px">

Suction Mode: Gentle

Food Mode: Moist

Suction Strength: 29 kPA (1) - 30 kPA (2)

Cycle Time: 22s (1) - 25s (2)

In this test, the sealer outperformed the dry food test but still has room for improvement. The suction ranged from 29 to 30 kPA, and each cycle lasted between 22 to 25 seconds. While it removed most of the air, some air pockets remained. Although the mango slices were not crushed, there was still some juice leakage. Fortunately, it didn’t affect the sealer.

Design
------

design Scores: **5.5**

*   Build Quality (50%) - **6.0**/10
    
*   Control Panel (20%) - **8.5**/10
    
*   Lid (20%) - **4.0**/10
    

The Mueller MV-1100's design matches its affordable price — it's not particularly eye-catching. While the company attempted to add some stylish touches, such as a metallic top lid and touch-sensitive buttons, you can still tell it's a budget-friendly model once you’ve picked it up due to its stiff lid locks and the absence of extra features. Thankfully, we didn't uncover any major design flaws that might impact the unit's long-term durability.

### In the Box

### Dimensions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/mueller-vacuum-sealer-mv-1100-moist-dimensions-clprtwumx0005pz88gabr7e8e.jpg" alt="The dimensions of the Mueller MV-1100 vacuum sealer. The length is 14.1 inches, the width is 6.0 inches, and the height is 3.1 inches." width="300px" height="200px">

Weight: 2.2 lbs (1.0 kg)

Length: 14.1" (35.8 cm)

Width: 6.0" (15.2 cm)

Height: 3.1" (7.9 cm)

Compared to other vacuum sealers in our database, the Mueller sealer is larger and heavier. As such, it may not be the best choice if you’re seeking a compact sealer. However, at just 2.2 pounds, it's relatively lightweight and easy to carry. If size isn't a concern for you, it shouldn't be too inconvenient.

### 6.0 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/mueller-vacuum-sealer-mv-1100-build-quality-1-clpru7oic000apz88gyul5p9f.jpg" alt="The Mueller MV-1100 comes with a glossy, metallic top lid, which made it look slightly more premium." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/mueller-vacuum-sealer-mv-1100-build-quality-clpru7f740009pz88ewst54r1.jpg" alt="The interior of the Mueller MV-1100 is textured." width="300px" height="200px">

The Mueller vacuum sealer offers impressive build quality at an affordable price. The lid features a sleek metal component that enhances the overall luxurious look of the sealer. The control panel, comprised of touch-sensitive buttons, is neatly arranged at the top.

One notable feature is the embossed interior, which adds a fascinating texture to the sealer. Although the finishing is generally good, there’s room for improvement in the lid and the locking mechanism. Both felt stiff and difficult to use compared to other models we've tested.

### 8.5 - Control Panel

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/mueller-vacuum-sealer-mv-1100-control-panel-clpru3d1l0008pz88d8yv8j1k.jpg" alt="The rows of function buttons on the control panel of the Mueller MV-1100 vacuum sealer." width="300px" height="200px">

Button Type: Touch-sensitive

Numberof Buttons: 5

Numberof Modes: 4

The Mueller sealer has a control panel with five touch-sensitive buttons.

The first two adjust vacuum and food modes, while the other three control sealing functions.

The mode-changing buttons have corresponding lights, and the “Seal” and “Vac Seal” buttons light up when pressed. However, the touch-sensitive buttons can be occasionally unresponsive, requiring longer presses to register. Overall, the control panel is well-arranged and user-friendly.

### 4.0 - Lid

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/mueller-vacuum-sealer-mv-1100-lid-clpruafd1000bpz880gm1dma5.jpg" alt="The hinges do a great job at keeping the Mueller MV-1100’s lid aloft, but the locking mechanism is problematic." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/mueller-vacuum-sealer-mv-1100-lid-1-clprubkau000cpz888mwg9fte.jpg" alt="The hinges on the Mueller are solid, keeping the lid from shifting even when we push it from side to side." width="300px" height="200px">

Lid Lock: Latch lock

Our first impression of the lid isn't great. It makes a creaking sound when opened, which raises concerns about its long-term durability.

To secure it, all you need to do is press down on the lid, and there are two latch locks that will click into place. To unlock it, simply press the release buttons on either side of the unit.

In our testing, we noticed that the lid locks can be a bit finicky. They don't always snap into place smoothly when you press down on the lid, and it can be a bit challenging to close the lid securely. This might be a little annoying if you're trying to operate the sealer with just one hand, which is why the Mueller received such a low score in this section.

### Failed - Extra Features

Bag Cutter: No

Bag Holder: No

Bag Hooks: No

Removable Drip Ttray: No

The Mueller doesn’t come with any extra features.

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **6.0**

*   Ease of Use (70%) - **5.0**/10
    
*   Safety & Noise (15%) - **8.0**/10
    
*   Indicator Lights and Chime (15%) - **9.0**/10
    

The Mueller MV-1100's user-friendliness could use some improvement. Firstly, the lid locks are quite problematic as they tend to be unreliable and require a considerable amount of force to securely lock. Additionally, the touch-sensitive buttons are overly sensitive and can sometimes misinterpret commands. However, despite these concerns, the unit performs well in terms of safety, noise level, and indicator light brightness, making it a solid choice overall.

### 5.0 - Ease of Use

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/mueller-vacuum-sealer-mv-1100-ease-use-1-clpruef15000epz887xjhbyqq.jpg" alt="The lid requires a lot of downward force to click close, so you almost always have to use both hands to shut the lid." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/mueller-vacuum-sealer-mv-1100-ease-use-clprudzpj000dpz888219hvfa.jpg" alt="The Mueller’s ease of use could use a lot of improvements, starting with its unreliable lid locks and the overtly-sensitive control panel." width="300px" height="200px">

The Mueller's handling is poor due to two issues: the lid and the unreliable control panel. As mentioned in the Design section, one side of the lid on our unit doesn't lock in tandem with the other. As a result, we always have to double-check to ensure both locks are engaged when we press down on the lid.

### 8.0 - Safety & Noise

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/mueller-vacuum-sealer-mv-1100-safety-1-clpruqaaa000hpz882x0ud9ub.jpg" alt="The various safety and instruction stickers that Mueller has included on the inside of the Mueller MV-1100 sealer." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/mueller-vacuum-sealer-mv-1100-safety-clprumf73000gpz88dfw83y5j.jpg" alt="The “Caution: Hot Surface” warning sticker located near the heat bar within the interior of the Mueller MV-1100 sealer." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/mueller-vacuum-sealer-mv-1100-noise-clprufg8v000fpz88c8uz7g0g.jpg" alt="The sealer can get as loud as 81.2 dBA, like during this dry food test." width="300px" height="200px">

Maximum Noise Level: 81.2 dBA

Safety could be improved if the heat bar, which can get very hot after several working cycles, was marked with something more permanent than a peelable warning sticker. Even though the heating bar shouldn't get hot enough to cause injuries, new users who are not yet familiar with how vacuum sealers work could be startled if they accidentally touch it.

While the Mueller is not the noisiest model in the latest batch of vacuum sealers, it is on the louder side at 81 dBA.

### 9.0 - Indicator Lights and Chime

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/mueller-vacuum-sealer-mv-1100-indicator-lights-clprusdee000ipz88doii81fn.jpg" alt="Besides the four indicator lights that display vacuuming and food modes, there are also two lights beneath the two function buttons (“Seal” and “Vac Seal”) and the progress bar." width="300px" height="200px">

Numberof Indicators: 6

Progress Bar: Yes

Chime: No

All indicator lights are decently bright and visible even under harsh studio lighting. The Mueller doesn’t come with an audible chime, which is to be expected at this price point.

It comes with a progress bar at the top, which you can use to conveniently track the sealer’s working cycle.
