The Mueller MV-1100 is a vacuum sealer that falls somewhat short in various aspects. However, among the sealers we've tested in its price range, it performs quite well and stands out as [one of the top performers](https://healthykitchen101.com/vacuum-sealers/reviews/best/). There are areas for improvement beyond its performance, though. For instance, the lid locks are somewhat uneven, making the sealer a bit awkward to use. Additionally, the control panel can be unreliable, which affects its overall usability score.

Overall, while the Mueller may not be the absolute best on the market, it offers good value for the money, especially compared to other budget models in our database.

**Things We Like**

*   Passable vacuum-packing performance for the money
*   Decent build quality
*   The control panel is user-friendly
*   Good safety features
*   Bright indicator lights

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Uneven lid locks
*   Buttons on the control panel are unreliable

Mueller is a household name known for a wide range of kitchen tools, from knife sharpeners to toaster ovens. So, it’s not surprising that there’s a vacuum sealer in the mix: the Mueller MV-1100 automated food vacuum sealer.

For a week, we tested the MV-1100 sealer in our lab, carefully evaluating its performance, design, and ease of use. All of our findings can be found in this detailed report!

Performance
-----------

performance Scores: **5.8**

*   Dry Food Test (60%) - **5.8**/10
    
*   Moist Food Test (40%) - **6.0**/10
    

The performance of the Mueller vacuum sealer is underwhelming. It received mediocre scores in both dry and moist food tests. Although it managed to seal bags of dry food without leaving air bubbles and didn’t crush the fresh mango slices in the moist food test, our reviewers still found its performance lacking.

### Dry Food Test

Suction Mode: Airtight

Food Mode: Dry

Recorded Suction: 46 kPA (1) - 47 kPA (2)

Suction Time: 18s (1) - 22s (2)

The Mueller achieved a consistent suction power of 46-47 kPa in two test sessions, as measured by our vacuum gauge. However, our timer showed a slight discrepancy in working time, with the first session taking 18 seconds and the second session taking 22 seconds. The time difference is insignificant, but it contributed to the Mueller's lower score in this test.

### Moist Food Test

Suction Mode: Gentle

Food Mode: Moist

Recorded Suction: 29 kPA (1) - 30 kPA (2)

Suction Time: 22s (1) - 25s (2)

In this test, the sealer outperformed the dry food test but still has room for improvement. The suction ranged from 29 to 30 kPA, and each cycle lasted between 22 to 25 seconds. While it removed most of the air, some air pockets remained. Although the mango slices were not crushed, there was still some juice leakage. Fortunately, it didn’t affect the sealer.

Design
------

design Scores: **4.7**

*   Build Quality (50%) - **6.0**/10
    
*   Control Panel (20%) - **8.5**/10
    
*   Lid (20%) - **0**/10
    

### 6.0 - Build Quality

The Mueller vacuum sealer offers impressive build quality at an affordable price. The lid features a sleek metal component that enhances the overall luxurious look of the sealer. The control panel buttons are conveniently designed for easy clicking.

One notable feature is the embossed interior, which adds a fascinating texture to the sealer. Although the finishing is generally good, there’s room for improvement in the lid and the locking mechanism. Both felt stiff and difficult to use compared to other models we've tested.

### 8.5 - Control Panel

Button Type:

Numberof Buttons:

Numberof Modes:

The Mueller sealer has a control panel with five touch-sensitive buttons.

The first two adjust vacuum and food modes, while the other three control sealing functions.

The mode-changing buttons have corresponding lights, and the “Seal” and “Vac Seal” buttons light up when pressed. However, the touch-sensitive buttons can be occasionally unresponsive, requiring longer presses to register. Overall, the control panel is well-arranged and user-friendly.

### Lid

Lid Lock: Latch lock

The lid isn’t as well-crafted as we had hoped. The lock on one side of the sealer is noticeably more sensitive than the other. As a result, whenever we try to close the lid, one side always clicks into place first while the other is still slack. We always had to double-check the locks to ensure the lid was firmly locked down before engaging the suction.
