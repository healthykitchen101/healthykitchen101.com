### Dry Food Test

Suction Mode: N/A

Food Mode: Dry

Recorded Suction: 62 kPA (1) - 63 kPA (2)

Suction Time: 11s (1) - 11s (2)

In the dry food test, the FoodSaver VS-0100 stood out with its high suction power. Our vacuum gauge recorded peak vacuums of 62 kPA and 63 kPA in the two respective tests. The black rice grains we used for testing were tightly packed with no visible air pockets inside.

It also impressed our reviewers with its speedy performance by completing a full working cycle, including sealing, in just 11 seconds.

### Moist Food Test

Suction Mode: N/A

Food Mode: Moist

Recorded Suction: 45 kPA (1) - 58 kPA (2)

Suction Time: 39s (1) - 33s (2)

In moist mode, suction power decreased greatly. During two test sessions, the vacuum sealer achieved peak vacuums of 45 kPA and 58 kPA, respectively. The fresh mango slices we used for testing were gently packed without them being crushed or leaking juice.

The sealer operates more slowly in this mode, taking 39 seconds in the first session and 33 seconds in the second session to complete a cycle.

Design
------

design Scores: **9.0**

*   Build Quality (50%) - **10**/10
    
*   Control Panel (20%) - **10**/10
    
*   Lid (20%) - **10**/10
    

The FoodSaver VS-0100 stands out with its metallic top piece. Its sleek and elegant design earned top marks for build quality from our reviewers. Components such as the control panel and the lid also received perfect scores in our evaluation. However, the VS-0100 lacks extra features, like a bag cutter, which is disappointing.

### 10 - Build Quality

The FoodSaver VS-0100 is mostly made of plastic, which keeps it both affordable and lightweight. However, the top piece has a metallic sheen, which gives it a premium appearance and feel despite the price tag.

Inside the sealer, the vacuum channel is protected by a green plastic bar. We strongly recommend keeping this bar and putting it back into the vacuum channel when the sealer is not in use. It’ll keep dust from building inside the sealer while it’s in storage.

At the bottom, the vacuum sealer has grippy feet to prevent it from sliding, even on wet countertops

All components, including the heat bar and the foam seal around the vacuum channel, are well-made.

### 10 - Control Panel

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/foodsaver-vs-0100-vacuum-sealer-control-panel-clp7qkvyo000bmm886l2w9g28.jpg" alt="A close-up shot of the buttons and the indicator lights on the FoodSaver VS-0100." width="300px" height="200px">

Button Type: Physical

Numberof Buttons: 3

Numberof Modes: 2

The control panel is simple, with just three buttons. You've got the "Vacuum" button to start the vacuum process, and right next to it, the "Seal" button for sealing bags.

Over on the far right, there's a smaller "Mode" button, which lets you easily switch between dry and moist food settings.

Above the “Vacuum” and “Seal” buttons are indicator lights. These lights pulse gently during each stage of the working cycle (vacuuming, then sealing.) When they stop flashing, that’s your cue that the cycle’s completed.

### 10 - Lid

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/foodsaver-vs-0100-vacuum-sealer-lid-clp7qs45t000dmm8831t1a3mt.jpg" alt="The interior of the FoodSaver VS-0100 with the green protective plastic bar removed from the vacuum channel." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/foodsaver-vs-0100-vacuum-sealer-lid-1-clp7qnxo5000cmm887cjk6jm8.jpg" alt="The slider to the side of the FoodSaver VS-0100 that you can use to engage the storage locks." width="300px" height="200px">

Lid Lock: Latch lock

The lid of the VS-0100 is very well-constructed. The hinges remained rock-solid even when we shook it during our test, showing no signs of wobbling. When we applied pressure to close the lid, the locks engaged effortlessly without requiring much force.

A unique feature of the FoodSaver VS-0100 that sets it apart is its storage lock. When you’re storing the sealer, you can switch the slider on the side to "Store" mode. This locks up the lid and won't release even when you push the release latches. This design prevents the sealer from accidentally opening during storage, effectively keeping dirt and dust out.

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **9.3**

*   Ease of Use (70%) - **10**/10
    
*   Safety & Noise (15%) - **8.0**/10
    
*   Indicator Lights and Chime (15%) - **7.0**/10
    

The FoodSaver VS-0100 is highly user-friendly. We didn't encounter any difficulties when closing the lid or inserting the bag into the vacuum channel. While there's room for improvement in safety and an audible chime to track the working progress could be a useful addition, there aren't many issues to nitpick in this department.

### 10 - Ease of Use

The handling experience of the FoodSaver VS-0100 can be best described as "seamless," according to our reviewers. The control panel is user-friendly, and the lid requires minimal effort to operate. As a result, our reviewers unanimously gave the FoodSaver VS-0100 the highest score in this segment.

### 8.0 - Safety & Noise

Maximum Noise Level: 77.9 dBA

Safety could be enhanced with the addition of a warning sticker to caution new users that it can get hot after use. Currently, there are no warnings inside the sealer, and all safety information is in the user manual, which some users may not read.

The VS-0100 is on the quieter end when compared to other models we've tested. We recorded a sound level of approximately 75-77 dBA during testing. In contrast, many models we've tested had surpassed 80 dBA in noise output.

### 7.0 - Indicator Lights and Chime

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/foodsaver-vs-0100-vacuum-sealer-indicator-lights-clp7r87y0000emm88239afrw8.jpg" alt="The FoodSaver VS-0100 vacuum sealer’s control panel with the indicator lights lit up. The light will pulse depending on what phase of the working cycle it’s performing at the moment." width="300px" height="200px">

Numberof Indicators: 2

Progress Bar: No

Chime: No

The indicator lights are bright, and, by looking at the way they pulse, you can track the working progress of the vacuum sealer throughout a working cycle. The FoodSaver VS-0100 doesn’t come with an audible chime.
