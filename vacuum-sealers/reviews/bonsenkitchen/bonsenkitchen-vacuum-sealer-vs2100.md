The BonsenKitchen VS2100, a budget vacuum sealer, falls short in performance compared to mid and high-end models. It has a cheap-looking design with a faux metal lid made of plastic. On the upside, it's easy to clean due to its detachable top part. One positive point is its quiet operation, measuring at only 76.1 dBA, making it one of the quietest sealers we've tested.

**Things We Like**

*   Affordable
*   The lid is detachable for easier cleaning
*   Control panel is simple and easy to use
*   Quiet operation (76.1 dBA max)
*   Very bright indicator lights

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Mediocre performance across the board
*   Cheap-looking and flimsy build
*   The lid is problematic to use and requires a lot of force to shut

As one of the cheapest vacuum sealers you can get today, it’s not surprising that the BonsenKitchen VS2100 has made its way into the shopping cart of lots of users. However, if you're wondering whether there's a catch to its low price, you're right to be curious. We put this sealer to the test, and the results were not very promising.

Here's our full report after a week of testing the BonsenKitchen VS2100 in our lab.

Performance
-----------

performance Scores: **NaN**

*   Dry Food Test (60%) - **4.8**/undefined
    
*   Moist Food Test (40%) - **1.2**/undefined
    

The BonsenKitchen VS2100 performed poorly in our tests. It couldn't meet the minimum passing score for both dry and moist food tests, primarily because of its weak suction in both tests and excessively long sealing time when handling moist foods.

### Dry Food Test

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/bonsenkitchen-vs2100-dry-food-test-clr7gqh6z0027qw88d1m4f4ql.jpg" alt="The BonsenKitchen VS2100 sealer during its first dry food test session, where we used it to vacuum-pack a bag of black rice grains. It achieved a peak suction of 30 kPA in a 6-second working cycle." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/bonsenkitchen-vs2100-dry-food-test-1-clr7gqh2q0026qw88beca08lc.jpg" alt="The BonsenKitchen VS2100 in the second dry food test session. This time around, it achieved a slightly higher peak suction at 34 kPA, but also a longer working cycle of 6 seconds." width="300px" height="200px">

Suction Mode: N/A

Food Mode: Dry

Suction Strength: 31 kPA (1) - 35 kPA (2)

Cycle Time: 6s (1) - 6s (2)

Out of the two performance tests, the BonsenKitchen VS2100 did better in the dry food test. However, its score was just average and didn't quite reach the minimum passing score for this category.

To be more specific, in the first test, the BonsenKitchen achieved a maximum suction of 31 kPA. In the second test, it managed to get a slightly higher suction level of 35 kPA. What's noteworthy is that it consistently completed a sealing cycle in just 6 seconds in both tests.

While the quick sealing speed is a positive feature, it couldn't fully make up for the relatively weak suction power of the sealer. Ideally, it should have a suction strength of 45 kPA or more to effectively seal bags with minimal air remaining inside.

### Moist Food Test

Our vacuum gauge recorded a peak suction of just 10 kPA during a 49-second working cycle." width="300px" height="200px">

Suction Mode: N/A

Food Mode: Moist

Suction Strength: 11 kPA (1) - 10 kPA (2)

Cycle Time: 49s(1) - 47s (2)

The BonsenKitchen VS2100 has the poorest performance in this test out of all the models we’ve tested.

In two separate tests, this vacuum sealer reached a maximum suction level of only 11 kPA, which is barely any suction at all. The final bag still has plenty of air inside by the time the sealer is finished.

The VS2100 also took an exceedingly long time to complete a sealing cycle, taking 49 seconds in the first test and 47 seconds in the second.

If you frequently vacuum-seal moist or liquid-heavy foods, we strongly advise against choosing the BonsenKitchen VS2100 for this reason.

The BonsenKitchen VS2100 has an unremarkable design, despite attempts to make it look premium with a faux-metal top lid. It's clearly a budget-friendly, entry-level vacuum sealer with a somewhat cheap and flimsy feel. One standout feature, though, is its detachable top portion, which greatly simplifies cleaning.

### In the Box

There’s a roll and a few sheets of pre-cut plastic bags, air hose and adapter, and documentations." width="300px" height="200px">

The sealer comes in a simplistic cardboard box. Inside, you get the sealer itself along with some accessories:

*   Pre-cut sheets of plastic bags
*   An air hose and adapter
*   A replacement foam seal
*   Instruction manual

### Weight & Dimensions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/dimensions-bonsenkitchen-vacuum-sealer-clr7h3hhk002bqw8858yb0snl.jpg" alt="The dimensions of the BonsenKitchen VS2100 vacuum sealer. Its length is marked as 15.2 inches, width is 5.7 inches, and height is 3.0 inches." width="300px" height="200px">

Weight: 2.6 lbs (1.2 kg)

Length: 15.2" (38.6 cm)

Width: 5.7" (14.5 cm)

Height: 3.0" (7.6 cm)

The BonsenKitchen VS2100 falls within the average size and weight range compared to most vacuum sealers in our database. It's not as compact as space-saving models like the Megawise VS6621, but it also won't occupy as much space as full-size models like the Anova Precision Pro. The weight is quite manageable, and most people should have no trouble picking it up with just one hand.

### 7.0 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/bonsenkitchen-vs2100-build-quality-clr7h3hho002cqw88892cd5yg.jpg" alt="The BonsenKitchen VS2100 is fairly well-built, but it’s still obvious even at a distance that the sealer is a budget model." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/bonsenkitchen-vs2100-build-quality-2-clr7h3hx1002dqw88cdtz57vp.jpg" alt="The sealer has a slightly flimsy feel to it due to being made almost entirely from plastic." width="300px" height="200px">

Our reviewers have described the build quality of the BonsenKitchen VS2100 as "acceptable." The designers have made efforts to enhance its visual appeal by giving the top lid a silvery, metal-like surface (though it's still made of plastic, just with a metallic finish). However, upon closer inspection, it’s hard to ignore the somewhat flimsy plastic components that clearly marked it as a budget product.

### 9.0 - Control Panel

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/bonsenkitchen-vs2100-control-panel-clr7h6l3j002mqw88gxz2awln.jpg" alt="The control panel features five buttons, each with clear visual icons and indicator lights placed on top of them for more intuitive using experience." width="300px" height="200px">

Button Type: Physical

Number of Buttons: 5

Number of Modes: 2

The BonsenKitchen vacuum sealer has a user-friendly control panel with five clearly labeled buttons. Unlike some other models we've tried, this one simplifies things by combining the food mode adjustment and cycle start into a single button. To get started, just pick either "Dry" or "Moist" depending on your food type, and the sealer will begin working.

If you only want to seal the bag without vacuuming, there's a "Seal" button for that. And if you need to pulse vacuum, hold down the "Vac" button, and the motor will keep running as long as you press it. Lastly, on the far right, there's an "Accessory" button that's handy when you want to use the sealer with an air hose and adapter.

### 5.0 - Lid

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/bonsenkitchen-vs2100-lid-clr7h3hxw002eqw880vcb7mbo.jpg" alt="The lid is solidly-built, but difficult to close with one hand." width="300px" height="200px">

Lid Lock:

When we initially unboxed the sealer, we noticed that the lid was quite loose. After a while of fiddling, surprisingly, we could pop the top portion of the sealer from the base with ease. There’s no mention of such a feature in the online product description when we first ordered the unit, so this was a rather panicky moment for us.

It was only after consulting the manual that we discovered this is a feature, not a bug. The top portion of the sealer contains all of the essential components, from the vacuuming motor to the heating bar. By popping off the top, you can clean the bottom part, which contains the vacuum channel, more easily without risking damage to the sensitive electronics.

Although it is convenient to clean, the removable design also equates to a more flimsy lid overall. It creaks and doesn’t feel solid when we lift or lower the lid.

### Failed - Extra Features

Bag Cutter: No

Bag Holder: No

Bag Hooks: No

Removable Drip Tray: No

The BonsenKitchen VS2100 doesn’t come with any extra features of note.

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **NaN**

*   Ease of Use (70%) - **6.0**/undefined
    
*   Safety & Noise (15%) - **10**/undefined
    
*   Indicator Lights and Chime (15%) - **7.0**/undefined
    

The BonsenKitchen VS2100 is user-friendly for the most part. The using experience is great, although it has a couple of drawbacks, such as a tricky locking mechanism and the absence of bag hooks, which can make bag alignment a bit challenging. However, it makes up for these drawbacks with its quiet operation, decent safety features, and bright indicator lights.

### 6.0 - Ease of Use

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/bonsenkitchen-vs2100-ease-use-clr7h3hy9002hqw887c6r4cd8.jpg" alt="The lid of the vacuum sealer is tricky to use one-handed. The user has to apply even force on both sides of the lid for it to click close properly." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/bonsenkitchen-vs2100-ease-use-1-clr7h3hyd002iqw884gtn72yy.jpg" alt="The BonsenKitchen VS2100 comes with small, raised “brackets” in the vacuum channel to keep the bag straight, but they don’t function as well as bag hooks." width="300px" height="200px">

Although the detachable lid of the BonsenKitchen is great for cleaning, it doesn’t contribute a lot to usability. The locks on the lid (which are ordinary latch locks) don't feel solid or evenly-placed. We had to use both hands to press down firmly on the lid to get it to click close. This can be an issue if you ever find yourself having to use the sealer one-handed.

### 10 - Safety & Noise

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/bonsenkitchen-vs2100-noise-bonsenkitchen-1-clr7h3hy0002fqw88agqj8mjr.jpg" alt="The BonsenKitchen VS2100 during a dry food test. Our noise level meter to the side recorded a peak loudness of 76.1 dBA. You can also see the safety sticker plastered on the front of the unit." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/bonsenkitchen-vs2100-safety-1-clr7h3hyo002jqw88dgb4hfxq.jpg" alt="Inside of the sealer is another sticker that details all of the steps you need to know to run the sealer correctly and safely." width="300px" height="200px">

Maximum Noise Level: 76.1 dBA

Although it ruins the aesthetic of the sealer, safety-wise, we appreciate the sticker plastered on the top lid. Besides giving you a briefing on how to use the sealer, it also contains important safety information.

The BonsenKitchen’s noise level is moderate compared to other vacuum sealers we have in our database (most of which exceeds 80 dBA.) As such, if you prefer a quieter kitchen, the VS2100 will make for a fairly compelling choice.

### 7.0 - Indicator Lights and Chime

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/vacuum-sealers/bonsenkitchen-vs2100-indicator-lights-chime-clr7h3hyw002kqw884b22cnqg.jpg" alt="There are corresponding indicator lights for each button on the control panel. The lights are bright and can be easily seen under harsh studio lighting." width="300px" height="200px">

Number of Indicators: 5

Progress Bar: No

Chime: No

There are five indicator lights that correspond to each button on the control panel. The lights are decently bright and are clearly visible even under harsh studio lighting, so if you were to leave the sealer next to the window, it shouldn’t be hard to monitor the sealer’s progress under direct sunlight.

Unfortunately, it doesn’t come with a chime, so until the indicator on top of your chosen vacuuming mode (“Dry” or “Moist”) turn off, which indicates the finishing of a working cycle, you’ll have no other way of knowing when the sealer has finished working.
