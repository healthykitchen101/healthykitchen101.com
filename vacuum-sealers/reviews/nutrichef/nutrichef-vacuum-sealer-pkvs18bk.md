The Nutrichef PKVS18BK is quite possibly one of the [best-looking vacuum sealers](https://healthykitchen101.com/vacuum-sealers/reviews/best/) in the price range. But it doesn’t just excel in terms of design, the sealer also did great in our usability assessment, as well, thanks to its easy-to-use and intuitive control panel. However, while the vacuum sealer receives great scores on design and usability grounds, its mediocre performance does take away quite a lot of the plus points that we gave the sealer in terms of design.

So, if with the Nutrichef PKVS18BK, you won’t get a low raw suction power — which could make it a great choice for sealing soft, moist food, but not for food that requires maximum vacuum, like steak meant for sous vide cooking.

**Things We Like**

*   Relatively affordable
*   Visually-appealing design
*   The lid and the attached locking mechanism are well-built
*   Simple and intuitive control panel
*   Bright and comprehensive indicator lights

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   The lid requires quite a lot of force to close properly.
*   Motor is loud.
*   Doesn’t come with any extra feature.

The Nutrichef PKVS18BK immediately caught our eye with its sleek black-and-white design and glossy finish. It gave off a premium vibe and didn't feel like a cheap product at all. From the moment we unboxed it in the lab, we already had high expectations for the sealer in terms of performance, design, and usability.

Here's the report on how the Nutrichef PKVS18BK fared in our comprehensive tests!

Performance
-----------

performance Scores: **5.7**

*   Dry Food Test (60%) - **4.7**/10
    
*   Moist Food Test (40%) - **7.1**/10
    

Regrettably, the Nutrichef PKVS18BK didn't perform well in our tests. It scored poorly in the dry food test, earning just 4.35 out of 10, mainly due to its underwhelming suction performance. The sealer barely passed the moist food test, scoring 6.6 out of 10. Tallying up all the scores, the Nutrichef PKVS18BK ended up with a rather mediocre total performance score of 5.3 out of 10.

### Dry Food Test

Suction Mode: Normal

Food Mode: Dry

Recorded Suction: 33 kPA (1) - 45 kPA (2)

Suction Time: 17s (1) - 21s (2)

During our two dry food tests, the Nutrichef PKVS18BK showed rather weak suction performance, ranging from 33 kPA in the first test to a peak of 45 kPA in the second. Even under the most favorable conditions, it only just met the minimum suction strength required for a passing score in our grading chart.

The saving grace for the Nutrichef PKVS18BK in this section was its relatively quick cycle times: 17 seconds in the first session and 21 seconds in the second.

All in all, the Nutrichef PKVS18BK may not be the best choice if a great dry food-packing ability is a priority for you.

### Moist Food Test

Suction Mode: Gentle

Food Mode: Moist

Recorded Suction: 30 kPA (1) - 28 kPA (2)

Suction Time: 16s (1) - 15s (2)

Interestingly, when we switched the suction mode to "Gentle," we didn't see a significant drop in suction power. In the first test, it reached 30 kPA, only 3 kPA less than the "Normal" mode. The cycle time was similar, taking just 16 seconds.

In the second test, there was a more noticeable difference. It reached 28 kPA with a shorter 15-second cycle time. We tested it with fresh mango slices, and while there were a few air bubbles left, the fruit slices weren't squished, which was a success.

Design
------

design Scores: **7.0**

*   Build Quality (50%) - **10**/10
    
*   Control Panel (20%) - **10**/10
    
*   (20%) - **0**/10
    

Our team’s quite happy with the Nutrichef's design, which has a sleek black-and-white housing that looks elegant and high-end. The build quality is excellent, with every part being solidly built, and there were no obvious design or manufacturing flaws anywhere on the unit. The touch-sensitive control panel is user-friendly but could be more responsive. The only major drawback is that the unit lacks extra features, which, to be fair to Nutrichef, is to be expected in a sealer at this price range. Overall, the Nutrichef PKVS18Bk received a 7.7/10 in this section.

### 10 - Build Quality

The Nutrichef PKVS18BK boasts excellent overall build quality, with a securely attached lid to the base through robust hinges. After rigorous tugging and shaking tests, there's no hint of flimsiness. The lid's top features a glossy material that initially looks great when the sealer is first unboxed. However, over time, this part of the lid tends to accumulate smudges from fingerprints and light scratches, so you’ll have to regularly clean the sealer if you want to maintain its look.

On the unit's bottom, you'll find white anti-slip feet that ensure stability during use. The interior is well-constructed with a patterned plastic inner plate. The foam strip surrounding the vacuum channel does a great job of forming a tight seal when the lid is closed to aid with the vacuum-packing process.
