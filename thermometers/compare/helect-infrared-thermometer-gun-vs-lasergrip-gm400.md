The Helect gets a thumbs-up for its reliability and sturdy build. It aced our tests, ranking among the most accurate IR thermometers we've ever tried.

On the other hand, the Lasergrip GM400 struggled with accuracy and has some design quirks, like a dim laser and fewer measurement options compared to the Helect.

That makes the Helect the better choice overall. It not only outperforms the Lasergrip GM400 but also offers better durability and far more features for the money.
