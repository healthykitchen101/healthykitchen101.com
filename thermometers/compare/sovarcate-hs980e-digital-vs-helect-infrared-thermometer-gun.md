If you're looking for a thermometer that's both super accurate and versatile, the Sovarcate HS980E is the one to consider. It aced our tests and offers a bunch of different modes, making it a smart purchase. Plus, it's easy to use and built to last.

On the other hand, the Helect IR thermometer almost matches the Sovarcate HS980E's performance in our tests, but at a much lower price. It's a real bargain for budget-conscious shoppers. However, there's a reason it's cheaper â€“ the Helect isn't built with the same quality of design or the ease of use of the more premium Sovarcate HS980E. Most notably, the Helect doesn't have as many measurement options as the Sovarcate. So, if you need a thermometer for occasional use, it'll do the job just fine. But if you want a pro-grade thermometer, the Sovarcate HS980E is going to be a far better choice.
