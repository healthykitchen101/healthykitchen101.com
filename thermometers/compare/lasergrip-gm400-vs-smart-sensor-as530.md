It’s pretty unfortunate that both the Lasergrip GM400 and the Smart Sensor AS530 fall into the lower-performing category among IR thermometers in our database. 

Performance-wise, while the Lasergrip GM400 did perform somewhat better with a total score of 5.3, compared to the Smart Sensor AS530's failing score of 4.8, it still has some issues.

Our reviewers have found that the Lasergrip GM400 has subpar build quality, and many of its features, like the laser emitter, aren't great. Both models also lack extra measurement options, which limits how versatile they can be.

All things considered, it's tough to recommend either the Lasergrip GM400 or the Smart Sensor AS530, especially given that there are better options available in this price range. However, if you have to choose between the two, the Smart Sensor AS530 might be a slightly better pick because of its slightly better build quality.
