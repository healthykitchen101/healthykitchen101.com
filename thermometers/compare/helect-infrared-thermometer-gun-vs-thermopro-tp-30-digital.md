Besides having fairly decent accuracy, the Helect thermometer also stands out for its ergonomic design and ease of use. This model should be a good companion both in the kitchen as well as outside, ready to help you with any temperature-measuring application.

On the other hand, the ThermoPro TP-30, while offering a similar set of functionalities, has far more limited accuracy than the Helect, according to our testing, particularly in high-temperature scenarios like measuring the temperature of a hot pan of oil. Our reviewers have also noted the ThermoPro TP-30 to have fairly mediocre build quality and design.

If precision and ergonomics are your priorities, the Helect H1020 would be the better choice. The ThermoPro TP-30, despite its shortcomings, could still be a viable option for basic kitchen use where extreme accuracy isn't as critical.
