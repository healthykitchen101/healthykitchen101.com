The SOVARCATE HS980E stands out for its excellent measurement accuracy. Combined with a rugged design and a multitude of measurement modes, the Sovarcate HS980E made it to the top of our listing quite easily.

On the flip side, the Lasergrip GM400 is a functional IR thermometer, but it doesn’t shine as much as the Sovarcate HS980E.  Its temperature readings aren’t as accurate, and its design isn't all that impressive. It also lacks extra measurement modes and features as the SOVARCATE HS980E.

In short, if you want reliability, user-friendliness, and a wide range of features, the SOVARCATE HS980E is the better pick. The Lasergrip GM400 does the job and will be a good pick for budget-conscious people who don’t need a lot out of their IR thermometer.
