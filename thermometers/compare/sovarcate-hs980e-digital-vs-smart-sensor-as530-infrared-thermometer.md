The SOVARCATE HS980E stands out for its remarkable accuracy in our performance tests. This accuracy, along with its many measurement modes, makes it a versatile choice for various kitchen and household tasks.

On the other hand, the Smart Sensor AS530, while well-built, falls short in terms of accuracy. It lacks extra measurement modes and doesn't perform as well overall, which may not be suitable for users who need precise measurements. So, if you want accuracy and a wider range of features, the SOVARCATE HS980E is the way to go.
