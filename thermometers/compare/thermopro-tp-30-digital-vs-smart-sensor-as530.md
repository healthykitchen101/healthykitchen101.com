Although the ThermoPro TP-30 didn't perform exceptionally well in our performance test, receiving a total score of 6.3 out of 10, it still outshone the Smart Sensor AS530, which earned a failing score of 4.8 out of 10.

Measurement accuracy aside, the thing that sets the ThermoPro TP-30 apart is its numerous measurement modes. This makes it useful beyond the kitchen, whereas the Smart Sensor AS530â€™s lack of any measurement modes can make it a bit troublesome to use. Taking these factors into consideration, recommending the ThermoPro TP-30 as a thermometer of choice becomes quite straightforward, and we haven't even touched upon its design aspects!
