As of May 2023, the Etekcity Lasergrip 1080 is the lowest-performing infrared thermometer in [our database](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/best/infrared-thermometers/). It exhibits poor measurement accuracy, and build quality leaves much to be desired. Specifically, the trigger's metallic clicky sound gives the impression of a manufacturing defect.

Due to these shortcomings, it’s hard for us to recommend the Lasergrip 1080 for any use.

**Things We Like**

*   The handle is textured and has indents that improve the user’s grip

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Poor accuracy on the hot test with cooking oil
*   Metallic clicky sound in the trigger seems to suggest a manufacturing defect

Although it inherits the same design as the [Etekcity Lasergrip 800](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/etekcity/etekcity-lasergrip-800/), the Lasergrip 1080 doesn’t get the performance or the build quality of its larger and more premium sibling. The complete opposite, in fact. It’s one of the few models in our database that received a failing mark in our performance test.

As such, the Etekcity Lasergrip 1080 isn’t high on our list of recommended infrared thermometers to buy. Instead, you can check out high performers like the Wintact, [Eventek](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/eventek/eventek-et312-infrared-thermometer/), Helect, or [Mecurate](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/mecurate/mecurate-irt600a-digital/) IR thermometer.

Performance
-----------

performance Scores: **4.1**

*   Cold Test with Ice (40%) - **7.8**/10
    
*   Hot Test with Cooking Oil (60%) - **1.6**/10
    

The Etekcity Lasergrip 1080 performed decently well in the cold test with ice. However, it completely failed the hot test with cooking oil by returning results that were dozens of degrees above the set temperature of the oil (361°F.)

Due to its disappointing performance in the hot test, the total score of the Etekcity Lasergrip 1080 turned out very low — beneath the minimum threshold needed to pass the performance test.

### Cold Test with Ice

Ice Temperature: 32°F

Temperature at 12”: 33.4°F

Temperature at 16”: 34.3°F

Once the ice bath temperature has stabilized at 32°F, we put the Etekcity Lasergrip 1080 to the test at two different distances. At 12 inches, the thermometer registered a reading of 33.4°F, and at 16 inches, a reading of 34.3°F.

Plugging them into our benchmark, the Etekcity Lasergrip 1080 received an average score of 8.15. And when we accounted for the stability variable, we got a total score of 7.75 out of 10.

This is a decent score, on par with some of the better infrared thermometers in our database, such as the [Helect](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/helect/helect-infrared-thermometer-h1020/) infrared thermometer.

### Hot Test with Cooking Oil

Oil Temperature: 361°F

Temperature at 12”: 374.7°F

Temperature at 16”: 381.2°F

At a stabilized cooking oil temperature of 361°F, two recordings were made using the Etekcity Lasergrip 1080. From a distance of 12 inches, the reading was 374.7°F, and from 16 inches, the reading was 381.2°F. These are extremely inaccurate results. Our benchmark gives the Lasergrip 1080 an average score of only 2.5, and when accounting for the stability variable, the thermometer's total score drops to just 1.63 out of 10.

As of May 2023, the Lasergrip 1080 has the poorest score in the hot test out of all IR thermometers in our database. It’s also the main reason why the Lasergrip 1080 ultimately failed the performance test.

Design
------

design Scores: **7.3**

*   Build Quality (50%) - **7.0**/10
    
*   Laser Emitter (25%) - **8.0**/10
    
*   Display Panel (25%) - **7.0**/10
    

The Etekcity Lasergrip 1080 comes in a minimalistic shipping box with plastic packaging and pre-installed AAA batteries. At 4.59 ounces, the Lasergrip 1080 is lighter by 1.7 ounces than its sibling model, the Lasergrip 800.

Its build quality is lackluster. The trigger gives off a metallic click that’s very grating to listen to, though it doesn't affect its functionality. The laser emitter has a bright single-dot pattern, making it visible even under harsh lighting. The display panel is a backlit LCD panel, 1.18 inches in size, allowing for easy reading from various angles and under different lighting conditions.

### In the Box

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/etekcity-lasergrip-1080-infrared-thermometer-box-cli1i5tvu001ley880knhfp3z.jpg" alt="The Etekcity Lasergrip 1080 is in the frame's center. The user manual and the warranty card are to the left, and the plastic packaging is to the right." width="300px" height="200px">

The shipping box of the Etekcity Lasergrip 1080 is fairly minimalistic. It comes in plastic packaging with the batteries already installed inside the thermometer. So, you’ll only find the thermometer itself, user manuals, and warranty card inside.

### Dimensions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/etekcity-lasergrip-1080-infrared-thermometer-dimensions-cli1i6pvg001mey88gtbf59e6.jpg" alt="The dimensions of the Etekcity Lasergrip 1080. The length is 3.9 inches, the width is 1.57 inches, and the height is 6.3 inches." width="300px" height="200px">

Weight: 4.6 oz (130 g)

Length: 3.9" (9.9 cm)

Width: 1.6" (4.0 cm)

Height: 6.3" (16.0 cm)

In terms of overall dimensions and weight, the Etekcity Lasergrip 1080 is about average. Compared to the sibling it shares a design with — the Etekcity Lasergrip 800 — the Lasergrip 1080 is noticeably smaller and lighter (by 1.7 ounces.)

### 7.0 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/etekcity-lasergrip-1080-infrared-thermometer-build-quality-cli1i7hlc001ney88hno8613l.jpg" alt="The black-and-yellow Etekcity Lasergrip 1080 on its side on a dark grey concrete table top." width="300px" height="200px">

While the aesthetic is nice, the build quality of the thermometer can be greatly improved. The trigger isn’t finished very well. When pressed, they give off a metallic click as if there’s a loose spring coil behind the trigger. While this doesn't affect the functionality of the trigger, the sound is unpleasant and gives the impression of something broken inside the thermometer.

### 8.0 - Laser Emitter

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/etekcity-lasergrip-1080-infrared-thermometer-laser-emitter-1-cli1i8soh001pey881todhwpo.jpg" alt="The red laser dot of the laser emitter on the Etekcity Lasergrip 1080 in a dark room." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/etekcity-lasergrip-1080-infrared-thermometer-laser-emitter-cli1i89d5001oey887i459e96.jpg" alt="The laser emitter and the IR sensor of the Etekcity Lasergrip 1080." width="300px" height="200px">

Laser Pattern: Single-dot

Brightness: Good

The Etekcity Lasergrip 1080 comes with a single-dot laser emitter. The brightness is decent. It’s not the brightest we’ve ever seen, but under harsh lighting and against a white background, we still easily see and track the laser dot.

### 7.0 - Display Panel

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/etekcity-lasergrip-1080-infrared-thermometer-display-panel-cli1i9xq8001qey88ahq5gqty.jpg" alt="The backlit LCD display panel of the Etekcity Lasergrip 1080 with the backlight off (left) and on (right).

Display Type: Backlit LCD Panel

Backlight: Yes

Display Size: 1.18

The LCD panel does a decent job at displaying data. The numbers can be seen from many angles and read under harsh lighting. There is a blue backlight that you can control via the control panel to help you read the numbers even in dark rooms.

### Battery Compartment

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/etekcity-lasergrip-1080-infrared-thermometer-battery-compartment-cli1ibhib001rey88b6wdazws.jpg" alt="The inside of the Etekcity Lasergrip 1080’s battery compartment, with two triple-A batteries and a pull tab." width="300px" height="200px">

Battery Type: AAA

The Etekcity Lasergrip 1080 is powered by two AAA batteries, which are already installed inside the thermometer upon arrival. To protect the battery contacts during transport, a pull tab needs to be removed. Once the tab is pulled, you can immediately start using the thermometer.

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **5.5**

*   Handling (50%) - **7.5**/10
    
*   Measurement Modes (30%) - **6.0**/10
    
*   Audio Cues (20%) - **0**/10
    

The Etekcity Lasergrip 1080 infrared thermometer has a user-friendly grip with indents and a textured front portion for a secure hold, even with wet hands. However, the trigger's excessive clickiness is considered bothersome, described by our reviewer as a "grating" metallic sound. The thermometer offers two measurement modes, allowing adjustment of the emissivity setting within a range of 0.10 to 1.00. It also features a "Max Mode" that displays the maximum recorded temperature. However, it lacks audio cues as it doesn't have a speaker.

### 7.5 - Handling

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/etekcity-lasergrip-1080-infrared-thermometer-handling-cli1ichol001sey88f2as7tsd.jpg" alt="The black-gloved hand of a reviewer holding and using the trigger of the Etekcity Lasergrip 1080 IR thermometer." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/etekcity-lasergrip-1080-infrared-thermometer-handling-1-cli1icxsr001tey883p4lebkd.jpg" alt="The indents at the front of the handle of the Etekcity Lasergrip 1080 IR thermometer." width="300px" height="200px">

The grip of the IR thermometer features indents to enhance the user's grip, and the textured portion at the front makes it easy to hold onto the thermometer even with wet hands, as noted by our reviewer. However, the excessively clicky trigger is considered an annoyance. While it didn't affect the functionality of the thermometer, our reviewer described the metallic clicky sound as "grating."
