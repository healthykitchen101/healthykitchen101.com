If you need something that can measure small spots and objects from a greater distance than most IR thermometers with a 12:1 or 10:1 Distance-to-Spot (D:S) ratio, then the Etekcity Lasergrip 800 will be a great choice. It's equipped with a sensor that has a 16:1 distance-to-spot ratio, giving it a much greater measurement range than standard thermometers on the market.

Our performance test found that the Lasergrip 800 produced accurate temperature readings at a distance of 16 inches and beyond.

While it may not have as many measurement modes as other thermometers on the market, and its build quality may not be the best, the Etekcity Lasergrip 800 isn’t [a shabby choice](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/best/infrared-thermometers/).

**Things We Like**

*   A 16:1 distance-to-spot (D:S) ratio, which allows the user to measure objects from farther distances.
*   Bright laser emitter.
*   The display panel is brightly lit and readable even under harsh studio lighting.
*   Battery is included and already installed when taken out of the box.

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Don’t come with any extra measurement mode.
*   Loose battery compartment door.
*   Don’t have any speaker or audio cues.

The Etekcity Lasergrip 800 stood out from all the other IR thermometers we tested due to its larger size. It also has a larger Distance-to-Spot (D:S) ratio than all the other models in our database at 16:1, allowing it to accurately measure objects and surfaces at longer distances.

Its ability to measure objects accurately from a greater distance than other thermometers will mean the Lasergrip 800’s usefulness will extend beyond the kitchen. According to many reviews, it’s also carved out a niche among engineers, HVAC professionals, and DIY-ers.

*   Hot Test with Cooking Oil (60%) - **7.3**/10
    

The overall performance of the Etekcity Lasergrip 800 is rated to be decent. The thermometer delivered good readings in both the ice-bath and the cooking oil tests. While the recorded figures weren’t perfect matches of our reference temperatures, they’re still within acceptable margins.

### Cold Test with Ice

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/etekcity-lasergrip-800-infrared-thermometer-cold-test-with-ice-thumbnail-clhohgqx2001f3p881m3s0t4w.jpg" alt="Etekcity Lasergrip 800 Infrared Thermometer Cold Test with Ice Video" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/etekcity-lasergrip-800-infrared-thermometer-cold-test-with-ice-clhfrdhia000cuw881a1o2qft.jpg" alt="A reviewer is using the Etekcity Lasergrip at a distance of 12 inches to measure the surface temperature of an ice bath.

The screen displays 29°F." width="300px" height="200px">

Ice Temperature: 32°F

Temperature at 12”: 28.4°F

Temperature at 16”: 29°F

The Etekcity Lasergrip 800 got a passing score (6.6) in our ice-bath test, but its readings fell short of expectations. The thermometer displayed temperatures of 28.4°F and 29°F at 12 inches and 16 inches, respectively, from the icy water's surface.

However, even with a ±2°F error tolerance, it missed the mark by 1°F to 2°F. This slight difference shouldn't be a problem for most practical uses, but it caused the Lasergrip 800 to score lower than expected in our benchmark.

Considering how other models, like the [Mecurate IR thermometer](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/mecurate/mecurate-irt600a-digital/) managed to hit exactly 32°F in this test, this result is far from being optimal.

### Hot Test with Cooking Oil

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/etekcity-lasergrip-800-infrared-thermometer-hot-test-with-cooking-oil-thumbnail-clhohhpfd001h3p883ox11xdv.jpg" alt="Etekcity Lasergrip 800 Infrared Thermometer Hot Test with Cooking Oil Video" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/etekcity-lasergrip-800-infrared-thermometer-hot-test-with-cooking-oil-clhfrgh1h000euw8857nx35n5.jpg" alt="A reviewer is using the Etekcity Lasergrip 800 to measure the surface temperature of a vat of hot cooking oil from a distance of 12 inches.

The screen reads 367.4°F." width="300px" height="200px">

Oil Temperature: 361°F

Temperature at 12”: 369.4°F

Temperature at 16”: 367.4°F

In the cooking oil test, the Etekcity Lasergrip 800 scored 7.3 out of 10, which is a very good score compared to other models in our database.

Unsurprisingly, the thermometer gave a more accurate reading when it was used at a distance of 16 inches, which matches its 16:1 distance-to-spot ratio. At this distance, the thermometer showed a temperature of 367.4°F — differing only 6.4°F from the reference temperature of 361°F.

At a closer distance of 12 inches, the Lasergrip 800 showed a higher temperature of 369.4°F, which differs from the reference temperature by up to 8.1°F. This is the reason why the thermometer didn’t get a higher score on this test. But, to be fair, 12 inches is much closer than the recommended distance for this thermometer.

The Lasergrip 800’s scoring is middling compared to other IR thermometers in our database. For example, the [Klein Tools IR1](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/klein-tools/klein-tools-ir1-infrared-thermometer/) received a much better score in this section, with a better average temperature of 364.4°F.

The thermometer comes in a plastic box. The battery is already loaded inside, so you only need to pick it up, pull a tab, and use it right away. It is larger in size than other thermometers, but lightweight at 6.8 ounces. However, the build quality could be a lot better. The door of the battery compartment of the unit we received is very loose.

### In the Box

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/etekcity-lasergrip-800-infrared-thermometer-box-clhfrilcw000guw887l9wdjex.jpg" alt="The Etekcity Lasergrip 800 IR thermometer lying on a dark grey table in the center, with its user manual to the left and its plastic box to the right." width="300px" height="200px">

The Etekcity Lasergrip 800 comes in a plastic box, with the battery already loaded within. Tear off the plastic, and you can use it right away.

Folded neatly behind the thermometer is an instruction sheet on how to use it. The sheet also has warranty details and other miscellaneous information.

### Dimensions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/etekcity-lasergrip-800-infrared-thermometer-dimensions-clho9rmgz00193p881mrbeeyf.jpg" alt="The dimensions of the Etekcity Lasergrip 800. The length is 5 inches, the width is 2.75 inches, and the height is 7 inches." width="300px" height="200px">

Weight: 6.8 oz (193 g)

Length: 5.0" (12.7 cm)

Width: 2.8" (7.0 cm)

Height: 7.0" (17.8 cm)

The Etekcity Lasergrip 800 is different from all the other IR thermometers in our database due to its large size. The size of the thermometer is substantial in the hand. When placed next to other thermometers, the Lasergrip 800 easily dwarfs all of them.

However, despite being physically bigger, the Lasergrip 800 is still very lightweight at just 6.8 ounces.

### 7.5 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/etekcity-lasergrip-800-infrared-thermometer-build-quality-1-clhfrky0q000iuw887qgk14mv.jpg" alt="A close-up view of the trigger of the Etekcity Lasergrip 800 IR thermometer." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/etekcity-lasergrip-800-infrared-thermometer-handling-2-clhob4siu001d3p883r4j6nsl.jpg" alt="A close-up view of the grip of the Etekcity Lasergrip 800 IR thermometer." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/etekcity-lasergrip-800-infrared-thermometer-build-quality-2-clho9xs6r001b3p88a1gyf9yd.jpg" alt="The control panel with four buttons on the Etekcity Lasergrip 800." width="300px" height="200px">

The build quality of the Etekcity Lasergrip 800 isn’t as good as we had hoped. The door of the battery compartment is very loose and can be pried off very easily just by pushing from the side. Because of this reason alone, we have major doubts about the long-term durability of the thermometer.

Fortunately, besides the loose door, all the other components of the thermometer, such as the trigger and the buttons, are done well. The trigger is clicky and tactile, while the buttons are responsive and don’t need you to press firmly on them to actuate.

### 8.0 - Laser Emitter

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/etekcity-lasergrip-800-infrared-thermometer-laser-emitter-clhoaibsk001c3p88exl2daqx.jpg" alt="The Etekcity Lasergrip 800’s laser emitter in a dark room." width="300px" height="200px">

Laser Pattern: Single-dot

Brightness: Good

The laser emitter of the Etekcity Lasergrip 800 is decently bright and is visible even under bright studio lighting. It’s not the brightest we’ve seen, however.

The thermometer uses a standard single-dot laser pattern.

### 9.0 - Display Panel

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/etekcity-lasergrip-800-infrared-thermometer-display-panel-clhfrpd36000kuw88dy059g34.jpg" alt="A close-up of the LCD screen panel of the Etekcity Lasergrip 800.

The screen currently displays 81.9°F." width="300px" height="200px">

Display Type: Backlit LCD

Backlight: Yes

Display Size: 1.18

Despite being very substantial in size, the screen panel of the Etekcity Lasergrip 800 is surprisingly small, measuring only 1.18 inches across. The screen is a backlit LCD. You can switch on or off the backlight via a button on the control panel underneath the display.

### Battery compartment

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/etekcity-lasergrip-800-infrared-thermometer-battery-compartment-clhfrrcff000luw888yv1hisj.jpg" alt="The door of the battery compartment is opened on the Etekcity Lasergrip 800 IR thermometer, revealing the 9V battery cell inside and connecting wires." width="300px" height="200px">

The IR thermometer comes with the battery pre-installed inside. The battery is a standard 9V cell.

Battery Type: 9V

The thermometer is powered by a 9V battery. When you open up the box, the battery is already inside the compartment and hooked up. So, you only need to take it out, press the trigger, and use it right away.

As we mentioned in the build quality section, the door of the battery compartment is quite loose, so be careful when you have to open it up to swap out the battery.

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **3.8**

*   Handling (50%) - **7.5**/10
    
*   Measurement Modes (30%) - **0**/10
    
*   Audio Cues (20%) - **0**/10
    

The thermometer is straightforward to use: press the trigger to scan, release it to hold, and read the temperature.

Unfortunately, the Etekcity Lasergrip 800 doesn’t come with any extra measurement mode, such as reading the average or max temperature. It also doesn’t allow you to set the emissivity setting (EMS) or re-calibrate the reading of the sensor.

The only thing you’re allowed to do is change the temperature value back and forth between Fahrenheit and Celsius and switch the backlight and laser emitter on and off.

### 7.5 - Handling

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/etekcity-lasergrip-800-infrared-thermometer-handling-clhfrs8r4000muw884ati6nnm.jpg" alt="The black-gloved hand of a reviewer is pressing on the trigger of the Etekcity Lasergrip 800 IR thermometer." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/etekcity-lasergrip-800-infrared-thermometer-build-quality-clhfrkek9000huw88au760qu5.jpg" alt="A close-up view of the grip of the Etekcity Lasergrip 800 IR thermometer." width="300px" height="200px">

Besides the casing itself, the handle was larger than most other IR thermometers we tested, too. Etekcity made a valiant attempt to size up the handle, adding indents to help the user’s fingers latch around the handle a bit more comfortably. However, due to our tester’s hand being on the small side, the handle was reported to still feel very awkward.

As such, the handling score is a bit lower here and comes with a caveat: the thermometer may not be very comfortable to use if you have small hands.

### Failed - Measurement Modes

Emissivity: No

Average Mode: No
