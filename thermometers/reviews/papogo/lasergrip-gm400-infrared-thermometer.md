*   Design (20%) - **6.1**/10
    
*   Usability (10%) - **4.3**/10
    

It is difficult for us to recommend the Lasergrip GM400 to anyone, for any use, with it having one of the poorest measurement accuracies in our database. In addition to its lackluster and cheap design and the absence of extra measurement modes and features, the price tag of the GM400 far exceeds its value.

We recommend looking at [our list](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/best/infrared-thermometers/) of top infrared thermometers, such as the [Eventek](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/eventek/eventek-et312-infrared-thermometer/) or the [Helect IR thermometer](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/helect/helect-infrared-thermometer-h1020/).

**Things We Like**

*   Passable measurement performance in the hot test with cooking oil
*   One of the lightest IR thermometers in our database

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Poor measurement accuracy in the cold test with ice
*   Lackluster build quality
*   Dim laser emitter
*   Lack of extra measurement modes

While the Lasergrip GM400 is very well-reviewed, the manufacturer PAPOGO isn’t a known name like Klein Tools or Etekcity. As such, we didn’t have a lot of expectations for this model going in.

Unfortunately, it proved us right. In all three tests, the GM400 either failed or barely eeked out a passing score.

For more detailed testing results, see our detailed report below.

Performance
-----------

performance Scores: **5.3**

*   Cold Test with Ice (40%) - **2.9**/10
    
*   Hot Test with Cooking Oil (60%) - **7.0**/10
    

In the cold test with ice, the Lasergrip GM400 has the worst score out of all the infrared thermometers in our test. Its total score is saved somewhat by having a passing score in the hot test with cooking oil. But overall, the Lasergrip GM400 is still considered to have failed the performance test.

### Cold Test with Ice

The screen reads 39.2°F." width="300px" height="200px">

Ice Temperature: 32°F

Temperature at 12”: 38.4°F

Temperature at 16”: 39.2°F

When the ice’s temperature stabilised at 32°F, we put the Lasergrip GM400 to the test. From 12 inches away, the thermometer gave a reading of 38.3°F, and from 16 inches, the thermometer gave an even more inaccurate reading of 39.2°F.

These readings are nowhere near the claimed error tolerance of the GM400, which is ±2.7°F. The benchmark gives the thermometer a very bad average score of 3.2 out of 10. And when accounting for the stability variable, the total score for the cold test is reduced even further, down to just 2.9 out of 10.

As of May 2023, The Lasergrip GM400 has one of the worst accuracies out of all the infrared thermometers in our database. It’s only second to the Smart Sensor AS530, with a score of 2.65 out of 10.

### Hot Test with Cooking Oil

The screen reads 364.4°F." width="300px" height="200px">

Oil Temperature: 361°F

Temperature at 12”: 370.5°F

Temperature at 16”: 364.4°F

Once the cooking oil had stabilized at 361°F, we put the Lasergrip GM400 to the test at two distances — 12 inches and 16 inches — and yielded two respective readings: 370.5°F and 364.4°F.

While the results are still higher than the ±2.7°F tolerance of the thermometer, our benchmark still considers this within acceptable limits. The average score of the GM400 is 7.78, and with the stability variable accounted for, we have a total score of 6.96 out of 10.

Design
------

design Scores: **6.1**

*   Build Quality (50%) - **6.0**/10
    
*   Laser Emitter (25%) - **5.0**/10
    
*   Display Panel (25%) - **7.5**/10
    

The Lasergrip GM400 infrared thermometer is one of the lightest IR thermometers in our database, weighing 4.3 ounces. The build quality is rated as "passable," but the plastic material feels flimsy, and the trigger lacks a satisfying click. The Lasergrip GM400 also got “Passable” ratings in all other aspects. It has a very dim laser emitter that’s hard to track under harsh lighting or white background. The display panel can accurately show data, but its brightness is still not the best we’ve seen.

### In the Box

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/lasergrip-gm400-infrared-thermometer-box-clhzpk03q000iey888vrqcdff.jpg" alt="The Lasergrip GM400 IR thermometer in its plastic packaging on a slate grey concrete table top." width="300px" height="200px">

The thermometer arrives in standard plastic packaging. In the box, you get the Lasergrip GM400 itself, a complimentary pack of batteries, and a user manual.

### Dimensions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/lasergrip-gm400-infrared-thermometer-dimensions-clhzpour7000jey882bxv047d.jpg" alt="The dimensions of the Lasergrip GM400 IR thermometer. The length is 4 inches, the width is 1.57 inches, and the height is 6.3 inches." width="300px" height="200px">

Weight: 4.3 oz (122 g)

Length: 4.0" (10.2 cm)

Width: 1.6" (4.0 cm)

Height: 6.3" (16.0 cm)

The dimensions are average compared to all the other IR thermometers in our database, but the Lasergrip GM400 is one of the lightest. But most people won’t even notice the difference in weight, with them only a few ounces apart from one another.

### 6.0 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/lasergrip-gm400-infrared-thermometer-build-quality-clhzq7o4t000key881gi10yqc.jpg" alt="The Lasergrip GM400 IR thermometer on a dark grey concrete tabletop against a blurry blue background." width="300px" height="200px">

The build quality of the Lasergrip GM400 is rated as “passable” by our reviewer. The unit has no outward problems, but the thermometer feels flimsy due to the cheap and light plastic. Its small trigger doesn’t click when pressed, giving it a “mushy” feel.

### 5.0 - Laser Emitter

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/lasergrip-gm400-infrared-thermometer-laser-emitter-1-clhzq9o80000mey88c95a9qdd.jpg" alt="The single, red laser dot of the Lasergrip GM400 IR thermometer in a dark room." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/lasergrip-gm400-infrared-thermometer-laser-emitter-clhzq8qek000ley88aiygfx2w.jpg" alt="The laser emitter and the IR sensor of the Lasergrip GM400." width="300px" height="200px">

Laser Pattern: Single-dot

Brightness: Bad

The Lasergrip GM400’s laser emitter is bad. When cast against a white background or under harsh lighting, the single-dot laser becomes so dim that it almost looks like it’s disappeared.

### 7.5 - Display Panel

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/lasergrip-gm400-infrared-thermometer-display-panel-clhzqahnw000ney88bre31nmt.jpg" alt="The Lasergrip GM400 IR thermometer’s display with the backlight off (left) and on (right)." width="300px" height="200px">

The Lasergrip GM400’s display with the backlight turned off (left) and on (right).

Display Type: Backlit LCD panel

Backlight: Yes

Display Size: 1.18

The display panel is a 1.18-inch backlit LCD panel. It does a passable job of displaying important data like temperature readings and working mode. The GM400’s display panel is quite dim compared to other infrared thermometers. You may have trouble reading numbers under harsh lighting.

You can switch a backlight on and off with a button on the control panel, which will help you read in the dark.

### Battery Compartment

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/lasergrip-gm400-infrared-thermometer-battery-compartment-clhzqi553000pey887l9u9hpz.jpg" alt="The Lasergrip GM400 with its battery compartment opened. To its right is one AAA battery." width="300px" height="200px">

Battery Type: AAA

Two triple-A batteries power the Lasergrip GM400. A pack of two complimentary batteries is included when you first unbox it. Pop open the battery compartment in front of the handle, install the batteries, and then use the infrared thermometer immediately by pressing the trigger.

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **4.3**

*   Handling (50%) - **7.0**/10
    
*   Measurement Modes (30%) - **0**/10
    
*   Audio Cues (20%) - **4.0**/10
    

The handling score of the Lasergrip GM400 is affected by the squishy trigger and the lack of texturing on the handle, which can make using the thermometer with wet hands a problem. The GM400 notably lacks additional measurement modes, and while the unit does come with a speaker, the sound volume is very small.

### 7.0 - Handling

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/lasergrip-gm400-infrared-thermometer-handling-clhzqk7cm000qey88058vau2j.jpg" alt="The white-gloved hand of a reviewer holding and using the Lasergrip GM400, with a finger on the trigger of the thermometer." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/lasergrip-gm400-infrared-thermometer-handling-1-clhzqlqh3000rey88dkll3mvc.jpg" alt="The ridges at the front of the Lasergrip GM400 IR thermometer." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/lasergrip-gm400-infrared-thermometer-handling-2-clhzqrysb000sey88cy8paa1d.jpg" alt="The handle of the Lasergrip GM400, with the patterning at the front of the handle in view." width="300px" height="200px">

The handling score of the Lasergrip GM400 is hobbled by its squishy trigger. 

Instead of giving a satisfying clicking sound, the trigger of the GM400 makes a muted “squish.” While it doesn’t impact the click registration, the mushy trigger makes the GM400 feel cheap.

The handle is made from smooth plastic, including the handle section. Even though there are ridges on the handle to improve grip, the lack of texturing on the handle can make holding and using the thermometer with a wet hand an issue.

### Failed - Measurement Modes

Emissivity: No

Average Mode: No

Min Mode: No

Max Mode: No

Calibration: No

Alarm Mode: No

The Lasergrip GM400 doesn’t come with any extra measurement mode.

### 4.0 - Audio Cues

The Lasergrip GM400 has a small speaker which beeps whenever you release the trigger. However, our reviewer noted that the speaker’s volume is very small. You'll hardly be able to hear it in a noisy kitchen with many appliances working at once.
