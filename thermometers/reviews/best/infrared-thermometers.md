IR thermometers can be used to check the temperature of ovens’ interiors.

Objects, including our bodies, emit [thermal radiation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/thermal-radiation). This radiation is often in the form of infrared (IR) light, which is invisible but detectable with specialized tools like IR thermometers. These devices can translate the intensity of this radiation into temperature readings, allowing you to read the temperature of any object and surface without touching it.

In the kitchen, IR thermometers offer a safe and convenient way to measure the surface temperatures of various kitchen appliances like stovetops, ovens, and grills. But unlike [other kinds of thermometers](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/best/), like wired probe thermometers, you don’t need to touch the hot surfaces, making it much safer to use. However, they cannot measure the internal temperature of food. For example, if you need to check the core temperature of poultry, [meat thermometers](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/best/) should be used.

How We Test
-----------

The performance of each IR thermometer is assessed using two tests: a cold test and a hot test.

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/how-we-test-ice-bath-clh8kx5ta0004oc888vwth03v.jpg" alt="The ice-bath test is being conducted on the Mercurate IRT600A. The ice bath temperature is verified to be 32°F using a temperature probe. Temperature readings of the thermometer are entered into the laptop." width="360" height="240">

The first test, known as the **cold test**, involved ice**.** We filled an insulated box with icy water and waited until the temperature stabilized at **32°F**. To ensure accuracy, we used a temperature probe to measure this temperature. Once the water hit the proper temperature, we took IR-thermometer temperature readings at two distances: **12 inches** and **16 inches** from the surface.

We then compared these readings to the temperature of the ice. The scores were based on how closely the IR thermometer was to that actual value of 32°F.

The second test (the hot test) called for **cooking oil.** Following a similar methodology, we heated a pan of cooking oil on a stovetop and maintained a temperature of **321°F**. We took two measurements—one at **12 inches** and one at **16 inches** from the oil—and compared them to the oil's actual temperature (321°F). The closer the thermometer's readings were to the oil's temperature, the better the performance score.

Our reviewers also assess the design of the thermometer, like the **build quality**, **laser emitter**, and the **display panel**.

A good IR thermometer should also be user-friendly and easy to handle. Consequently, we look into the **usability** of each model. Specifically, factors such as the **handling experience**, the **number of measurement modes**, and whether it includes **audio cues**.

FAQ
---

**How to use an infrared thermometer?**

Using infrared thermometers is incredibly simple. Just press and hold the trigger, aim the laser pointer at the point you wish to measure, and the temperature reading will instantly appear on the screen. Once you release the trigger, the thermometer will hold the last temperature reading on the screen for your convenience.

**How accurate are infrared thermometers?**

Accuracy differs from model to model. Most in our database claim to measure within ±2°F of the actual temperature. You’ll have to read your IR thermometer’s manual for more details.

**What are some of the factors that affect an infrared thermometer’s accuracy?**

Emissivity is one of the most important factors. Different materials have their unique emissivity values. Many thermometers give you the ability to change the emissivity setting of the sensor to improve accuracy. Then, there’s the distance between the thermometer and the object matters. This is usually demonstrated by the device's D:S (distance-to-spot) ratio.

Elements like temperature, humidity, and air currents can impact your measurements, as well. Because these are very hard to control, achieving absolute precision with any IR thermometer is often impossible. This is why most models have an "error tolerance," commonly around ±2°F from the actual temperature.

**Can I use these thermometers to measure body temperature?**

Thermometers designed for measuring body temperature belong to a different product class and have far higher precision.

As a result, IR thermometers intended for industrial or kitchen use explicitly state in their user manuals that they should not be used to measure body temperature.

**What are the advantages of IR thermometers compared to traditional thermometers (i.e., mercury-in-glass thermometers)?**

The greatest advantage of an infrared (IR) thermometer is that you never have to make direct contact with the surface to measure its temperature.

Cheap IR thermometers can provide precise readings within a 1-inch spot from 12-16 inches away. This allows you to monitor the temperature of your grill, stovetop, oven, and other appliances from a safe distance.

**Can I use an infrared thermometer to measure liquids?**

Yes, you can use an IR thermometer on liquids. However, keep in mind that it will only be able to measure the _surface temperature_ of the liquid. It won’t be able to tell you the temperature at the bottom or center of the liquid body.
