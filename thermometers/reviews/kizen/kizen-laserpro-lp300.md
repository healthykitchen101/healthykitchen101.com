Overall Score: **6.2**

*   Usability (10%) - **7.2**/10
    

The Kizen LaserPro LP300 is a tough case. On the one hand, it has excellent build quality and a great usability score. But on the other hand, with a very mediocre measurement mode, it won’t be much use if you’re looking for an infrared thermometer that can return exacting, extremely accurate results.

The Kizen LaserPro LP300 could be a good enough purchase for kitchen use where reading is off by a few degrees. But if you plan on using the thermometer for other applications, like industrial use or HVAC, other infrared thermometers on the market can give more precise results, like the [Helect](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/helect/helect-infrared-thermometer-h1020/) or the [Eventek thermometers](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/eventek/eventek-et312-infrared-thermometer/).

**Things We Like**

*   Quite affordable for what it is
*   Solid build quality
*   Laser emitter is bright and can be easily tracked
*   Display panel is decently bright and data points can be easily read in many conditions (under studio lighting, in the dark, etc.)
*   Handle is indented and textured for easier gripping
*   Loud speaker

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Mediocre measurement accuracy
*   Doesn’t have many measurement mode
*   The backlight can’t be turned off

Not much is known about Kizen besides their extensive portfolio on Amazon. Their thermometers, which include LaserPro LP300, are generally well-reviewed.

After testing a unit in our lab for a week, it’s hard to determine whether the LaserPro LP300 is a good deal. While it does a good job in the cold test with ice, it’s one of the few [infrared kitchen thermometers](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/best/infrared-thermometers/) in our database that failed the hot test with cooking oil.

Its lackluster measurement accuracy is the only drawback. Otherwise, the Kizen LaserPro LP300 performed excellently in our assessment's design and usability portions.

Check the detailed test report below.

Performance
-----------

performance Scores: **5.2**

*   Cold Test with Ice (40%) - **8.4**/10
    
*   Hot Test with Cooking Oil (60%) - **3.1**/10
    

The Kizen LaserPro LP300 performed well in the cold test with ice, but it failed the hot test with cooking oil. This affected its overall performance score and made us hesitant to recommend it, despite its high scores in other areas. However, the total score still falls within a passing range.

Therefore, for kitchen use where extreme precision is not crucial, the LaserPro LP300 could be a suitable choice. However, alternative infrared thermometers may be more suitable for industrial applications and other uses.

### Cold Test with Ice

The screen reads 31.3°F." width="300px" height="200px">

Ice Temperature: 32°F

Temperature at 12”: 30.4°F

Temperature at 16”: 31.3°F

After the temperature of the ice chest stabilized at 32°F, we put the Kizen LaserPro LP300 to the test. At two respective distances, 12 and 16 inches, the thermometer returned two readings of 30.4°F and 31.3°F.

These are very good results and within the ±2°F error tolerance. As such, our benchmark gives the LaserPro LP300 an average score of 8.85 out of 10. Further accounting for the stability variable, we get the total score of the Kizen LaserPro LP300 being 8.45 out of 10.

### Hot Test with Cooking Oil

The screen reads 374°F." width="300px" height="200px">

Oil Temperature: 361°F

Temperature at 12”: 378°F

Temperature at 16”: 374°F

With the cooking oil stabilizing at 361°F, we put the Kizen LaserPro LP300 to the test at two distances, 12 and 16 inches, receiving two respective readings: 378°F and 374°F. These readings well exceeded the ±2°F error tolerance of the thermometer.

Our benchmark gives the LaserPro LP300 an average score of just 3.5 out of 10 for this test portion. The scoring is even lower when we consider the stability variable, which lowers the score even further down to just 3.1 out of 10.
