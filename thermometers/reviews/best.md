A dependable thermometer is an essential tool to have in any kitchen, whether amateur or professional. It not only allows you to gauge the temperature of your cooking appliances, such as ovens and stovetops but also helps you monitor the progress of your dishes for their doneness.

Here at Healthy Kitchen 101, we've recently completed an exhaustive evaluation of various kinds of kitchen thermometers on the market. In this comprehensive review, you’ll find our top choices for 2024, categorized to help you easily select models that suit your needs and budget.

Why You Need a Thermometer
--------------------------

An IR thermometer is as essential as a meat thermometer in any modern kitchen. Its uses are many, allowing you to immediately measure the temperature of stovetops, ovens, grills, and frying pans during preheating and cooking. Beyond that, it’s great for verifying that your dishes have reached the proper temperature.

It also proves its value beyond the kitchen. You can rely on your IR thermometer to check your HVAC system's performance. And it’s handy for automotive maintenance, enabling you to monitor engine temperatures and diagnose problems effectively.

Different Types of Kitchen Thermometers
---------------------------------------

In the kitchen, chefs use numerous different kinds of thermometers to ensure that the temperature of their cooking equipment and their food is perfect. From IR thermometers to remotely sensing the temperature of pans and pots’ surfaces to meat thermometer probes to check the internal temperature of roasted chickens,  these tools come in all shapes and sizes and are extremely versatile.

Here are a few kinds of thermometers that you’ll see in a well-stocked kitchen.

### Infrared Thermometer

Infrared (IR) thermometers allow chefs to measure surfaces from a distance without making direct contact with them. This ability is super useful for remotely sensing cooking surfaces, such as pots, pans, and the interior of cooking appliances like ovens and microwaves. For pitmasters, the [best infrared thermometers](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/best/infrared-thermometers/) are also useful for measuring the temperature of your grill without you having to get very close to the fire. IR thermometers can also be used to measure the surface temperature of liquids and foods (like the outer skin of a grilled chicken.)

The main downside of an IR thermometer is that it is often time inaccurate (most kitchen-grade IR thermometers have a margin of error of around ±2°F.) Additionally, it can only measure an object’s surface temperature, not its internal temperature.

### Thermometer Probe

A thermometer probe consists of a metal spike that you insert into a piece of meat. Once inside, it measures the meat's internal temperature, helping you know precisely when the cooking is complete.

There are two main types of thermometer probes: instant-read thermometers and meat thermometers. If you need quick and accurate temperature readings right after cooking, an instant-read thermometer is your go-to.

On the other hand, the [best meat thermometers](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/best/meat-thermometers/) can help you monitor the internal temperature of the meat throughout the cooking process. It comes with a probe that is inserted into either the joint or the center of the meat. Unlike instant-read thermometers, the probe can be left there until the cooking is finished. It’s connected to a gauge or an easy-to-read LCD screen on the outside via a heat-protected wire.

You can find probe thermometers in either analog style, featuring a classic mechanical gauge, or digital with a user-friendly LCD screen.

### Oven Thermometer

The temperature knob on your oven's exterior isn't the most dependable way to gauge the internal temperature. When you select, let's say, 400°F on the oven's settings, the actual temperature inside could vary by as much as 25°F to 50°F. Moreover, certain spots in the oven might be hotter or cooler than others. Such spots can greatly affect cooking performance. This is why an oven thermometer becomes a must-have kitchen tool, especially for those who are particular about cooking at precise temperatures.

Most oven thermometers are designed like clocks that you can place directly on the oven rack or hang on a hook inside the baking area.

When setting the oven temperature, refer to the thermometer to check if the internal temperature matches your preference. If not, you can easily make the necessary adjustments for a perfectly cooked dish.

Things to Consider When Buying a Thermometer
--------------------------------------------

While shopping around for a new thermometer, here are a few things to remember.

### Accuracy

Accuracy is critical for a thermometer. Many of the thermometers available today claim to provide precise temperature readings within a range of 1°F to 2°F (you can usually find this detail in the user manual or product description).

However, it's often challenging to truly verify a thermometer's accuracy without carrying out benchmarking tests. This is precisely why Healthy Kitchen 101 is doing these reviews!

### Build Quality and Durability

Kitchen thermometers — from IR to meat thermometers — must be built to be sturdy and durable so they don't get damaged if they're accidentally dropped, splashed, or exposed to high temperatures.

Many kitchen-grade thermometers, particularly the more affordable ones, are constructed using impact-resistant plastic. On the other hand, the pricier options are crafted from stainless steel, offering greater longevity and the ability to endure much more wear and tear compared to the typical plastic thermometers.

### Ease of Use

Simplicity is key when it comes to usability. For example, some thermometers like IR models are incredibly user-friendly. Just point them at what you want to measure, press the trigger, and the reading pops up on the screen within 1 to 2 seconds.

On the flip side, there are thermometers like meat thermometers that might seem a bit more complicated to use. However, even with these, it shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes to grasp how they work.

A good thermometer, for us, shouldn’t take you more than a couple of minutes to figure out how to use.

### Number of Functions

Beyond their primary temperature measurement feature, many thermometers come with extra functions. Take the ThermoPro TP-20 wireless thermometer as an example. It includes a timer setting and an alarm function, allowing you to precisely time your cooking process down to the seconds.

The greater the number of functions a thermometer offers, the more adaptable and useful it becomes.

### Price

Lastly, let's talk about the price. This will vary based on the type of thermometer you're considering. Inexpensive IR thermometers usually range from $10 to $30, with higher-end models reaching around $40. On the contrary, meat thermometers cover a wider price spectrum. Instant-read types can cost between $10 to $15, while wireless, multi-probe models can reach higher prices of $75 to $100.

Before making your decision, carefully consider what you need from your thermometer. If you only cook occasional small meals, opting for more affordable options is sensible. However, if you like to cook elaborate, large meals, the pricier options will give you more features and improved accuracy.

How We Test the Best Kitchen Thermometers
-----------------------------------------

We have just finished testing and scoring 13 infrared thermometers. More reviews will be done and uploaded when we receive newer models in the lab. In the meantime, we’re testing and scoring other kitchen thermometers to diversify the listing further. These articles will be uploaded in the coming weeks.

But how were these thermometers assessed? We judged each model using three criteria.

### Performance

Measurement accuracy plays a crucial role in our evaluation process, accounting for 70% of the total score for each model.

To assess accuracy, we tested each thermometer’s measurement of an ice bath and a hot pan of cooking oil. We took measurements from two distances: 12 and 16 inches. The actual temperature of these substances was verified using a thermal probe.

By comparing the thermometer readings with the verified probe readings, we determined the accuracy of each model. The closer the thermometer readings were to those of the probe, the higher the score in this section.

You can read our detailed scoring guidelines for the tests [here](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/tests/infrared/#performance-70).

### Design

IR thermometers are known for their durability, as they are commonly used in more rugged places than just kitchens. While we don't expect these thermometers to endure significant impacts or immersion in dust or water, we still evaluate each model to gauge its overall build quality and durability.

This assessment allows us to determine how well the thermometers are constructed and how long they’re likely to last under ordinary use. 

### Ease of Use

IR thermometers tend to be very straightforward. Most people can intuit how to use one without reading the user manual. However, some models with more unconventional designs (the Klein Tools IR1, for example) will need a deeper look.

In this segment, we take a look at how easy each model is for the average person to use.
