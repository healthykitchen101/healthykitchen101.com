As of May 2023, the Eventek ET312 is our database's most well-rounded IR thermometer. The thermometer achieves high scores in all our test sections, ranging from the performance tests (the Eventek scored well in both the cold and the hot tests) to the design and usability tests. In addition to good measurement accuracy, the Eventek ET312 also comes equipped with many measurement modes.

The only issue we found with the Eventek is that the material that goes into the product isn’t very premium, making it looks and feels cheap.

And speaking of cheap, the Eventek ET312 is a very affordable thermometer (which explains the choice of material.) If you’re looking for a budget-friendly but decently reliable IR thermometer, this one will do the trick!

**Things We Like**

*   Great IR sensor that returns accurate readings
*   Well-built outer housing and parts
*   Bright laser emitter
*   Handling experience is decent
*   Decent complement of measurement modes for the kitchen
*   Loud speakers give off audio cues when the thermometer has finished scanning

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   The product looks and feels cheap
*   The handle isn’t textured, which can make it slippery on wet hands

Considering how cheap it is and how Eventek isn’t a very known brand in the US market, the success of this IR thermometer is quite surprising. We selected this IR thermometer for the [review project](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/best/infrared-thermometers/), bought a testing unit using our funds, and then put it through its paces in our lab. The results are surprising: the Eventek ET312 displays very good measurement accuracy for the price.

How good is it, actually?

Performance
-----------

performance Scores: **NaN**

*   Cold Test with Ice (40%) - **8.3**/undefined
    
*   Hot Test with Cooking Oil (60%) - **8.1**/undefined
    

In terms of performance, the Eventek is the most accurate out of the latest batch of 13 IR thermometers so far. It maintains scorings well above the 8.0 score band in both the cold test with ice and the hot test with cooking oil.

This puts it in the same order as other best performers, such as the [Sovarcate HS980E](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/sovarcate/sovarcate-hs980e-digital/) and the [Wintact IR thermometer](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/wintact/wintact-infrared-thermometer/).

### Cold Test with Ice

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/eventek-et312-infrared-thermometer-gun-cold-thumbnail-clhr5k9w10001h2887h4c8adq.jpg" alt="Eventek Infrared Thermometer Gun Cold Test with Ice Video" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/eventek-infrared-thermometer-gun-cold-test-with-ice-clhq0o7pm0018ow88bw6sdpgy.jpg" alt="The Eventek ET312, from 12 inches away, displaying a temperature of 32.2°F on the screen." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/eventek-infrared-thermometer-gun-cold-test-with-ice-1-clhq0p47v0019ow886utkeez4.jpg" alt="The Eventek ET312, from a distance of 16 inches away, displaying a temperature of 33.5°F on the screen." width="300px" height="200px">

Ice Temperature: 32°F

Temperature at 12”: 32.2°F

Temperature at 16”: 33.5°F

When used to measure the temperature of an ice bath (already verified by our temperature probe to be at exactly 32°F), the reading of the Eventek from 12 inches away is much more accurate than at 16 inches.

Specifically, at 12 inches, the Eventek is only off from the 32°F point by only a fraction (32.2°F). Setting it up from a bit farther at 16 inches, the Eventek returned a higher reading of 33.5°F.

Even though we didn’t get exact numbers, these are still very good readings for such a cheap IR thermometer.

Our benchmark gives it a very high average score of 9.15. But due to the large difference between the two readings, accounting for the stability variable, the total score for the Eventek ET312 is lowered down to 8.35 out of 10 — still a very high score in our listing.

### Hot Test with Cooking Oil

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/eventek-et312-infrared-thermometer-gun-hot-thumbnail-clhr5li9x0003h288gcpggx83.jpg" alt="Eventek Infrared Thermometer Gun Hot Test with Cooking Oil Video" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/eventek-infrared-thermometer-gun-hot-test-with-cooking-oil-clhq0tsx4001aow88eecr60e2.jpg" alt="The Eventek ET312 IR thermometer is displaying a temperature reading of 367.1°F at 12 inches away from the pan of cooking oil." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/eventek-infrared-thermometer-gun-hot-test-with-cooking-oil-1-clhq0ujby001bow882h2j5b5d.jpg" alt="The Eventek G550 measures the temperature of a pan of hot oil from a distance of 16 inches away. The screen reads 363.3°F." width="300px" height="200px">

Oil Temperature: 361°F

Temperature at 12”: 367.1°F

Temperature at 16”: 363.3°F

The overall performance of the Eventek in the hot test is just as good as in the cold test. Measuring a hot pan of cooking oil (verified by our temperature probe to be at 361°F and stable), we got a reading of 367.1°F from 12 inches away and 363.3°F from 16 inches.

Though both readings are above the claimed ±2°F error tolerance of the thermometer, according to our benchmarks, these are acceptably accurate. Our benchmark puts the Eventek ET312 at an average score of 8.9 out of 10.

Accounting for the stability variable, the total score for this model comes out to a respectable 8.12 out of 10.

To the left is the box, and to the right is the battery and user manual." width="300px" height="200px">

The Eventek ET312 IR thermometer comes in a very nice cardboard box. Inside is the thermometer in a plastic sleeve, complete with a pack of triple-A batteries and the user manual.

The unit we received is labeled as the "Eventek GM550" on the box and in the manual. However, the Amazon listing identifies it by a different serial number, the "Eventek ET312.” We couldn't find any product listing for "Eventek GM550."

To avoid confusion, we'll refer to this product as the Eventek ET312, following the name on the Amazon listing.

The handling experience of the Eventek ET312 is decent. Indents are built into the handle to make it easier for the user to grasp. However, the handle isn’t textured, making using the thermometer when your hand is wet an issue.

### 8.0 - Measurement Modes

Emissivity: 0.8-0.95

Average Mode: No

Min Mode: Yes

Max Mode: Yes

Calibration: Yes

Alarm Mode: No

The Eventek ET312 comes with three measurement modes: min, max, and calibration. You can also set the emissivity of the thermometer (there are only two presets, which are 0.8 and 0.95.)

This is a decent set of measurement modes and should fulfill most needs in the kitchen.

### 8.0 - Audio Cues

The Eventek ET312 comes with a speaker which beeps when you release the trigger and switch the HOLD mode. It’s loud enough to be heard in a noisy kitchen with other appliances.
