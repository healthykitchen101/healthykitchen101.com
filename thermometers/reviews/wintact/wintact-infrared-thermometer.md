Ice Temperature: 32°F

Temperature at 12”: 32.3°F

Temperature at 16”: 33.4°F

During the ice chest test, we conducted measurements with the Wintact WT530 at two distances: 12 inches and 16 inches. Once the temperature of the ice chest stabilized at 32°F, we recorded readings of 32.3°F and 33.4°F at the respective distances. The result at 12 inches was impressively close to the reference temperature, earning the thermometer a near-perfect score. At 16 inches, the temperature was approximately one degree higher.

Our benchmark gives the Wintact WT530 an outstanding average score of 9.15 out of 10. Further taking into account the stability variable, the total score for the thermometer in the cold test with ice amounts to 8.55 out of 10.

### Hot Test with Cooking Oil

Oil Temperature: 361°F

Temperature at 12”: 369.2°F

Temperature at 16”: 362.1°F

The test is started by heating a pan of cooking oil on the stovetop until the temperature stabilized at 361°F. We then measured the temperature using the Wintact WT530 from distances of 12 and 16 inches, resulting in readings of 369.2°F and 362.1°F, respectively.

These readings were considered good based on our benchmark. The thermometer received an impressive average score of 8.68 out of 10 for its performance. When factoring in the stability variable, the Wintact WT530 received a total score of 7.66 out of 10.

Despite the labeling stating the serial number as "Wintact WT530," the received model had the serial "Eventek WT320." However, it will be referred to as the Wintact WT530 based on the box for simplicity.

The thermometer weighs 4.36 ounces and has dimensions similar to other models in our database. Overall build quality is decent, although the battery compartment lid is loose, greatly impacting its final score in the build quality assessment.

### In the Box

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/wintact-infrared-thermometer-box-cli4ajyzq002bey8857x41u81.jpg" alt="The Wintact WT530 IR thermometer is lying on its side in the center of the frame. The printed cardboard shipping box is to the left, and the batteries and the user manual are to the right." width="300px" height="200px">

The thermometer comes in a printed cardboard box. Inside is the thermometer in a plastic sleeve, a pack of AAA batteries, and the user manual.

However, despite the box and labeling stating the serial number as "Wintact WT530," the model received through Amazon had the serial "Eventek WT320." No record of a model with the WT530 serial was found. To avoid confusion, we will refer to the thermometer as the Wintact WT530 based on the serial mentioned on the box.

### Dimensions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/wintact-infrared-thermometer-dimensions-cli2wd6e70020ey88hiayacu7.jpg" alt="The dimensions of the Wintact WT530 IR thermometer. The length is 3.14 inches, the width is 1.65 inches, and the height is 6.3 inches." width="300px" height="200px">

Weight: 4.4 oz (124 g)

Length: 3.1" (8.0 cm)

Width: 1.6" (4.2 cm)

Height: 6.3" (16.0 cm)

The Wintact WT530 weighs the same as the [Lasergrip GM400](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/papogo/lasergrip-gm400-infrared-thermometer/) and the [Eventek IR thermometer](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/eventek/eventek-et312-infrared-thermometer/) in our database, potentially due to sharing the same OEM. Their dimensions are very similar to one another, as well.

Compared to the rest of the models in our database, the Wintact WT530 is about average. Most people will be able to use it one-handed and not have trouble finding a place to store it, owing to its compactness.

### 7.5 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/wintact-infrared-thermometer-build-quality-thumbnail-cli4azwgh002eey880gt17tww.jpg" alt="Wintact Infrared Thermometer Build Quality Video" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/wintact-infrared-thermometer-build-quality-cli4al29h002cey88f4btdpvz.jpg" alt="The Wintact WT530 IR thermometer is lying on its side on a dark grey concrete table top." width="300px" height="200px">

The build quality of the Wintact WT530 is decent but not the best we’ve seen. Notably, the door of the battery compartment is quite loose. We only need to push the lid lightly for it to spring out of place.

Besides the issue with the lid, we didn’t find any other problem with the thermometer.

### 9.0 - Laser Emitter

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/wintact-infrared-thermometer-laser-emitter-cli4b2n0s002fey881tte0sbi.jpg" alt="The red dot from the laser emitter of the Wintact WT530 IR thermometer in a dark room." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/wintact-infrared-thermometer-laser-emitter-1-cli4b3bd7002gey886aqe7qpd.jpg" alt="The laser emitter and the IR sensor of the Wintact WT530 IR thermometer." width="300px" height="200px">

Laser Pattern: Single-dot

Brightness: Good

The laser emitter of the Wintact WT530 is very bright. We can track the single-dot red laser against a white background and under harsh studio lighting.

### 6.5 - Display Panel

Display Type: Backlit LCD Panel

Backlight: Yes

Display Size: 1.18-inch

The Wintact WT530 features a backlit LCD panel that offers excellent readability even under studio lighting conditions. Additionally, it includes a backlight specifically designed to assist in reading the screen in dark environments.

### Battery Compartment

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/wintact-infrared-thermometer-laser-emitter-cli4b2n0s002fey881tte0sbi.jpg" alt="The red dot from the laser emitter of the Wintact WT530 IR thermometer in a dark room." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/wintact-infrared-thermometer-laser-emitter-1-cli4b3bd7002gey886aqe7qpd.jpg" alt="The laser emitter and the IR sensor of the Wintact WT530 IR thermometer." width="300px" height="200px">

Battery Type: AAA

The Wintact WT520 is powered by triple-A batteries. However, one aspect affecting its overall build quality score is the loose battery compartment lid, which tends to spring open even with a light touch. This issue prevents the thermometer from achieving a higher build quality rating.

Usability

*   Handling (50%) - **8.0**/undefined
    
*   Measurement Modes (30%) - **8.0**/undefined
    
*   Audio Cues (20%) - **8.5**/undefined
    

The Wintact WT530 provides a good handling experience with its comfortable grip and a textured surface for better usability even with wet hands. It offers four measurement modes, allowing you to set the emissivity at 0.8 or 0.95 and display minimum and maximum temperature readings. The thermometer also has audio cues that are loud enough to be heard in a noisy kitchen.

### 8.0 - Handling

The handling experience of the Wintact WT530 is rated by our reviewer as “Good.” The indents on the handle mold themselves to the user’s hand, effectively providing a more comfortable user experience. The grip is also slightly textured, which makes using the infrared thermometer with wet hands easier.

### 8.0 - Measurement Modes

Emissivity: 0.8 & 0.95

Average Mode: No

Min Mode: Yes

Max Mode: Yes

Calibration: Yes

Alarm Mode: No

The Wintact WT530 comes with four different measurement modes. You can set the emissivity setting of the IR sensor at either 0.8 or 0.95. However, unlike several other IR models in our database, there is no ability to select emissivity values in-between these two options.

In addition to emissivity settings, the WT530 allows you to display both the minimum and maximum temperature readings. You can also set the thermometer to recalibrate the sensor, ensuring more precise and accurate temperature readings.

### 8.5 - Audio Cues

The Wintact WT530 infrared thermometer has a speaker. When you release the trigger, it gives off a loud beep, and the thermometer switches from SCAN to HOLD mode. The sound is loud and can be heard across the room. You most likely won’t have any issue hearing the beep of the thermometer in a loud kitchen.
