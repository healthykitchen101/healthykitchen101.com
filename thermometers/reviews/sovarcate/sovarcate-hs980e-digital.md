Sovarcate is a pretty popular name in the [infrared thermometer niche](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/best/infrared-thermometers/). Besides the HS980E (this model), they also got other models like the [HS960D](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/sovarcate/sovarcate-hs960d-manual/) and the [Smart Sensor AS530](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/sovarcate/smart-sensor-as530/), each of which had become hits among consumers. We bought a unit a few months earlier and put it through its paces in our laboratory to see how good it truly is, and, fortunately, the HS980E has proven itself to be a capable IR thermometer.

The IR thermometer is decently accurate in our performance tests — not the best, but passable. The Sovarcate HS980E also did well in our design and usability tests. We expect it’ll be a good fit as a kitchen thermometer.

Performance
-----------

performance Scores: **7.1**

*   Cold Test with Ice (40%) - **7.0**/10
    
*   Hot Test with Cooking Oil (60%) - **7.2**/10
    

The Sovarcate HS980E sits in the middle of our performance chart. It performs better than many models, like the Lasergrip GM400 or the [ThermoPro TP-30](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/thermopro/thermopro-tp30-digital/), but it’s still at a disadvantage compared to Wintact and [Helect](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/helect/helect-infrared-thermometer-h1020/).

Its scoring in the hot test with cooking oil is better than in the cold test by a few fractions. And as a whole, the Sovarcate HS980E gets passing scores on all tests, signaling it as a reliable infrared thermometer, but it may not be the most accurate.

### Cold Test with Ice

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/sovarcate-hs980e-digital-cold-test-with-ice-clhsu90fu000ux18839cf500f.jpg" alt="The Sovarcate HS980E from 12 inches away from the ice bath displays a temperature of 34.2°F on the screen." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/thermometers/sovarcate-hs980e-digital-cold-test-with-ice-1-clhsuh0cj000vx188f5qigly9.jpg" alt="The Sovarcate HS980E from 16 inches away from the ice bath displays a temperature of 35.1°F on the screen." width="300px" height="200px">

Ice Temperature: 32°F

Temperature at 12”: 34.2°F

Temperature at 16”: 35.1°F

In the cold test with ice, the Sovarcate HS980E receives only a mediocre score. The thermometer produces a reading of 34.2°F and 35.1°F from 12 and 16 inches distance, respectively. Altogether, we get an average score of 7.35. Accounting for the difference between each reading, according to our benchmark, the Sovarcate HS980E gets a 6.95 out of 10 on this test.

It’s not a bad result and is around the same score range as other models like the ThermoPro TP-30 and the [Klein Tools IR1](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/klein-tools/klein-tools-ir1-infrared-thermometer/). But its accuracy can be better.

### Hot Test with Cooking Oil

The screen reads 37°F." width="300px" height="200px">

Oil Temperature: 361°F

Temperature at 12”: 370°F

Temperature at 16”: 365°F

The Sovarcate HS980E does slightly better in the hot test with cooking oil. We recorded a reading of 370°F and 365°F at 12 inches and 16 inches, respectively. Our benchmark puts the average score of the thermometer at 7.75 and, accounting for the stability variable, gives it a total score of 7.15 out of 10.

This is a respectable score, putting the Sovarcate HS980E’s accuracy in line with models like the [Etekcity Lasergrip 800](https://healthykitchen101.com/thermometers/reviews/etekcity/etekcity-lasergrip-800/) and the Wintact infrared thermometer.
