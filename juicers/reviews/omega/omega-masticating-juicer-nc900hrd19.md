The Omega NC900 is a great masticating juicer that packs a punch. It handles fruits and vegetables of all textures with ease, squeezing out more juice in less time compared to most other juicers. The machine features a strong build, with sleek yet durable parts that snap together securely, but is also a breeze to assemble and take apart. The large size means it takes up more countertop and storage space than others; on the other hand, it can handle larger pieces of ingredients, thus saving you some prep time.

While the machine costs a bit more than some others, it sweetens the deal with additional parts for other functions, such as making noodles and chopping vegetables. All in all, it's a fantastic choice for a household of 2-5 people.

**Things We Like**

*   Strong build, secure fitting of parts
*   Efficient juicing
*   Spacious feed chute and tray
*   Robust and stylish design

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Large auger is not ideal for re-juicing
*   Large footprint than most, requires more storage space than most

The Omega NC900 is not a new product: It’s been on the market for more than a decade, way before “juice fasts” became trendy. But its popularity never seems to wane. 

We bought the Omega NC900HRD19 and took it for a spin to see if it’s the real deal or just marketing. We tested its performance with different ingredients, checked out how easy (or not) it is to use, and see if its design is more chic or clunky. We measured juice yield and quality, timed how long it took to complete the job, and assessed the hassle factor of assembling and cleaning. Spoiler alert: It scored high marks across the board. 

Read on to find the details of how it performed and see our specific ratings.

None of the four ingredients we picked for the performance test was much of a challenge to the Omega NC900: This masticating juicer handled everything with ease and grace. It made more juice out of the same amounts of ingredients. Although the auger speed is slow at 80 RPM, this juicer was always quick to complete the job. That is thanks to the spacious drum and feed chute, which minimize clogging and allow it to take more and larger size ingredients with ease.

The only thing we wish for is if it would be better at re-juicing the pulp; however, since the machine does get a lot out of the ingredients in the first go, we didn’t feel we wasted anything.

### Carrots

Ingredient Weight: 18 oz (500 g)

Juicing Time: 02 min 04 s

Yield: 7.9 oz (224 g)

Yield Percentage: 45%

The Omega NC900HRD was the fastest and produced the most juice among the juicer batch we tested. The large feed chute and pressure option for hard, dense vegetables really contribute to its effectiveness when juicing carrots. It took less than half the time the Elite Gourmet did to juice 18 oz of carrot sticks, but yielding an ounce more juice from the same amount of ingredients. The pulp it produced was higher than that by any other.

Though we used the same size for carrot sticks with other masticators in this test, the Omega NC900 has a wider-than-average feed chute that would take a whole small carrot, or one fourth of a large carrot. That would further significantly save your prep time, especially if carrot juice is a favorite in your household.

### Apples

Ingredient Weight: 18 oz (500 g)

Juicing Time: 02 min 44 s

Yield: 13.6 oz (386 g)

Yield Percentage: 77%

The Omega NC900 did well in the apple test, but not any better than other models we tested, such as the Jocuu or AMZChef. It actually took slightly longer than those two to complete the test, which was a surprise given the spacious feed chute. The apple wedges tend to get stuck between the chute wall and the auger, due to the auger’s inability to break the apple peel.

### Celery

Ingredient Weight: 18 oz (500 g)

Juicing Time: 3 min 21 s

Yield: 11.3 oz (320 g)

Yield Percentage: 64%

While its auger couldn’t cut the tough fiber strings, which caused the occasional clogging, the NC900’s high pressure setting proved to be effective in squeezing out the juice. It made about an ounce more celery juice than other machines. The machine was also quieter than most, with the loudest noise measured at 68-72 dB, whereas the Elite Gourmet, for example, was more in the 75-80 dB range.

### Kale

Ingredient Weight: 18 oz (500 g)

Juicing Time: 7 min 22 s

Yield: 11.0 oz (313 g)

Yield Percentage: 63%

Foam Level: 61.9%

The NC900 was the best kale juicer among the models we tested. Though admittedly not as fast as we’d prefer, this machine took the least time to complete the test, and made 1 - 2 oz more juice than other models from the same amount of kale (18 oz). That can accumulate to a _huge_ difference if you juice kale every day! The juice has a thick layer of froth on it, but that doesn’t affect the juice quality and is easily removable with a spoon or strainer.

Design

*   Dimensions & Footprint (40%) - **6.1**/undefined
    
*   Build Quality (50%) - **9.4**/undefined
    
*   Auger (10%) - **8.7**/undefined
    

The Omega NC900 boasts a robust and sturdy construction with durable parts. Its large auger features generous tooth spacing, making juicing and cleaning a breeze. Once locked together, the parts fit seamlessly, as if they were one piece. The vibrant red color of the body and the sleek design of its components add to its overall appeal.

However, due to its substantial size, this masticating juicer will occupy a considerable amount of space on your countertop. It's also heavier than most juicers, so if you have weak arms, you may want to keep it on the countertop between uses rather than storing it in a drawer.

### In the Box

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/juicers/omega-nc900-masticating-juicer-box-clwoeue4h002n7a88ahz11w1t.jpg" alt="Omega NC900 Masticating Juicer In the Box" width="300px" height="200px">

*   1 x Omega NC900HRD juicer body
*   Parts: hopper and drum, plunger, auger, juice mesh, drum cap, adjustable cap
*   1 x blank cone
*   4 x nozzles
*   1 x juice cup 
*   1 x pulp cup
*   1 x cleaning brush
*   1 x user guide

The Omega NC900 comes with more parts than most, including a blank cone and four plastic nozzles for other functions (making sorbets, nut milk, pasta, and other things). The sheer number of parts may seem overwhelming, but remember that you don’t (and can’t) use all of them at once. The parts are also easily available [online](https://omegajuicers.com/pages/juicer-shop-by-parts-part-nc900hdc). 

The user guide, which is in English, details the parts and how to assemble them for different purposes.

### 6.1 - Dimensions & Footprint

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/juicers/omega-nc900-masticating-juicer-dimensions-clwoeue4o002q7a887iqtdr6i.jpg" alt="Omega NC900 Masticating Juicer Dimensions" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/juicers/omega-nc900-masticating-juicer-clrsw0x770005ss885jht6fhe.jpg" alt="The red Omega NC900 masticating juicer, fully assembled, with carrot pulp in the pulp collector" width="300px" height="200px">

Depth: 19.0" (48.3 cm)

Width: 7.3" (18.5 cm)

Height: 13.0" (33.0 cm)

Weight: 13.0 lbs (5.9 kg)

Juice Cup Capacity: 34 fl. oz

Pulp Cup Capacity:

The Omega NC900 comes with large parts that enhance its usability. We like its big food tray, which helps prevent the food from dropping when being transferred to the feed chute. The plunger has a much smaller diameter than the feed chute, which lowers the chance of food getting stuck in between them, clogging the machine. In addition to an appropriate size juice cup, its pulp collector has ample space too. This allows you to make more juice without having to stop halfway through to empty the pulp. 

The downside is this unit requires a lot of countertop space. Due to its heavy weight, you wouldn’t want to move it in and out of storage on a daily basis — though if you do, it sports a handle that allows for easy one-handed transport. Even when disassembled, you will need a large and deep drawer to store all the parts.

### 9.4 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/juicers/omega-nc900-masticating-juicer-build-quality-clwoeue42002h7a8836a3g8x3.jpg" alt="Omega NC900 Masticating Juicer Build Quality" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/juicers/omega-nc900-masticating-juicer-build-quality-2-clwompw3500317a88832dbxnd.jpg" alt="Omega NC900 Masticating Juicer Build Quality 2" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/juicers/omega-nc900-masticating-juicer-build-quality-1-clwoeue44002i7a88029icce9.jpg" alt="Omega NC900 Masticating Juicer Build Quality 1" width="300px" height="200px">

The Omega NC900 has a sturdy construction, with parts fitting very securely—it was the only one among the batch we tested that did not rattle during operation. Despite some users' complaints about the fragility of the juice screen, our unit remained intact and functioned flawlessly throughout the testing process, attesting to the product's good material quality. The juicer's polished and seamless appearance gives it a stylish look and suggests a higher price point than its actual cost.

### 8.7 - Auger

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/juicers/omega-nc900-masticating-juicer-auger-clwoeue4f002m7a88elzzfewn.jpg" alt="Omega NC900 Masticating Juicer Auger" width="300px" height="200px">

The NC900 has a substantial auger with strong “teeth” that makes an easy  job of cutting and crushing the toughest fruits and vegetables. It’s also very easy to clean. The only downside is seen when you try to re-juice the pulp: The pulp would simply get stuck in the wide space between its teeth, so you get no more juice out of it.

The Omega NC900’s intuitive design makes assembling, disassembling, and cleaning it a bliss. It takes a few minutes in total to do all of those things. Juicing with it requires minimal effort, too, thanks to the spacious design. 

The only thing we’d change is the reverse function, which is incorporated into the very small but tight power switch, making it a hassle to use when you’re already stressing out about a clog.

### 9.0 - Assembling

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/juicers/omega-nc900-masticating-juicer-assembling-1-clwoeue4t002s7a8826fz37ht.jpg" alt="Omega NC900 Masticating Juicer Assembling 1" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/juicers/omega-nc900-masticating-juicer-assembling-clwomo0lu00307a882m2z52ov.jpg" alt="Omega NC900 Masticating Juicer Assembling" width="300px" height="200px">

It’s normal to feel a bit overwhelmed when you first see all the components of a masticating juicer. However, assembling this one is remarkably straightforward. We didn't even need to consult the manuals. For newcomers to masticators, the initial assembly typically takes no more than 15 minutes, and after that, it becomes a task of mere seconds.

A clever locking mechanism ensures a secure connection between the drum and juicer body. Additionally, these parts are conveniently labeled with indications and directions, eliminating any guesswork when twisting or turning. Every component effortlessly slots into place, streamlining the process and ensuring efficiency.

Disassembly is equally hassle-free. Once you've got the hang of it, it takes no more than 30 seconds to dismantle the parts.

### 9.2 - Juicing

Having larger parts than a typical home juicer, juicing with the Omega was a breeze. It accepts larger pieces of vegetables without the need for the plunger. The process was smooth, with minimal clogging or jamming.

That being said, the large size does have a disadvantage: You can’t really re-juice to extract more from the pulp, as smaller juicers can. However, since the yield is already good the first time, this wouldn’t be necessary anyway.

### 5.0 - Conveniences

Reverse Feature: Yes

Speed Pressure Options: 5

The NC900 has a reverse function that shares the same button as the power button. It's small and a bit heavy, and you need to keep pressing it to keep the reverse running. That proved to be difficult, and we found ourselves leaning on the machine a bit for leverage every time we pressed the button.

While the motor only operates at a single speed, you can adjust the pressure at which the pulp is pressed using the end cap. There are five pressure options available for different types of produce. The manual suggests a high pressure setting for citrus and low pressure setting for kale. So, if you’re juicing something soft and watery, set the cap to number 5, and if it’s tough and dense, loosen it to a lower setting.

### 8.8 - Cleaning

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/juicers/omega-nc900-masticating-juicer-cleaning-clwoeue4m002p7a88fbpfcctt.jpg" alt="Omega NC900 Masticating Juicer Cleaning" width="300px" height="200px">

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

Thanks to its sleek finish, cleaning the NC900 is a breeze. The only challenging part is the juice mesh, as tough strands of fibers tend to get stuck inside its tiny holes. The included brush can take care of that; however, it also helps if you immerse the juice mesh into mild soapy water immediately after juicing, before the fibers dry up and stick into the mesh.
