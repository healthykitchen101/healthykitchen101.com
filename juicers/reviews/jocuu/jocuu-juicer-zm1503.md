The Jocuu masticating juicer may not boast a stylish design or all the bells and whistles, but it gets the job done decently. It handles most ingredients with ease, crushing them at a reasonable speed and yielding above-average results. The masticator does tend to produce foamy kale juice and may require finer pre-cutting for particularly tough and fibrous ingredients, but aside from that, juicing with it is a breeze. Assembling requires some practice, but disassembling and cleaning are straightforward and effortless.

Overall, this masticator is a solid product for its price. Given its size and capacity, it's best suited for use in a small household (2 - 4 people).

**Things We Like**

*   Affordable price
*   Two speed modes for soft/hard ingredients
*   Compact, modest footprint
*   Minimal clogging 
*   Easy cleanup

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Makes foamy kale juice 
*   Squeaks when juicing hard ingredients

The Jocuu masticator is a budget juicer that's been generating a lot of buzz recently. We purchased it in early 2023 and subjected it to weeks of testing in our lab to evaluate its performance, design, and ease of use. We assembled the parts and assessed how they fit together, measured the juice yield with various types of ingredients, evaluated the noise level during juicing, and disassembled the machine to wash it manually.

Read on to see how this juicer holds up to home use and fits into the rhythm of your daily life.

The Jocuu masticating juicer’s strong squeeze  allows it to handle thick, hard fruits and vegetables such as apples, carrots, and celery efficiently—yielding above-average juice within reasonable time frames. It had difficulty juicing kale, however: the yield was modest compared to other masticators, and you may require a separator or a smart cup to remove the foam.

The consolation is that you can run the pulp through it a second time to extract more juice (about 15-20%) from any of those ingredients.

### Carrot

Ingredient Weight: 18 oz

Juicing Time: 2 min 53 s

Yield: 6.95 oz (197 g)

Yield Percentage: 39%

Hard and dense, juicing carrots is easy, but the juice yield from carrots is the lowest among the four ingredients we tested on any masticator. The Jocuu took just shy of 3 minutes to process 18 ounces of carrot sticks, which is neither fast nor slow compared to other machines, earning it 7.8 points for juicing time. It produced nearly 7 ounces of juice, slightly higher than the average mark, and received 6.9 points for juice yield in this test.

### Apple

Ingredient Weight: 18 oz

Juicing Time: 2 min 28 s

Yield: 13.65 oz (387 g)

Yield Percentage: 77%

As hard as they may seem, apples are rich in liquid and relatively easy to juice, with the only challenging part being the tough and slippery peel. The Jocuu's auger, similar to that on its AMZChef twin, features a design that allows it to cut through the apple peel very efficiently, even surpassing the Omega NC900 in juicing time (earning 9 points). However, the juice yield (8.4 points) wasn't outstanding compared to the other masticator models we tested in this batch.

### Celery

Ingredient Weight: 18 oz

Juicing Time: 3 min 2 s

Yield: 9.91 oz (281 g)

Yield Percentage: 56%

The Jocuu didn't encounter many problems working through the tough fibers on the celery stalks or the soft leaves that accompanied them. It was 30 seconds slower than the AMZ Chef but faster than the Omega NC900 in this test, earning it a juicing time score of 8.5 points. The juice yield was average (6.0 points), lagging slightly behind the Omega, which scored 8.0 points.

### Kale

Ingredient Weight: 18 oz

Juicing Time: 6 min 35 s

Yield: 9.35 oz (265 g)

Yield Percentage: 53%

Foam Percentage: 250%

The Jocuu has many strengths, but juicing kale isn’t one of them. While the smooth feed chute allowed the leaves to pass through with minimal jamming, resulting in a quick juicing time (8.5 points), the auger failed to extract a lot of juice from the paper-thin leaves (5.6 points), and by volume, there was a lot more foam than juice (0.0 points).

The Jocuu masticating juicer is well-built with durable materials and parts fitting nicely together, except at the connection between the drum and body, which squeaks when the machine is working through tough fibers, proving to be a little too flexible. While it could be more stylish, the machine is well-finished, showing no signs of poor build quality. Its parts—the plunger, feed chute, and juice and pulp cups—are all of appropriate size, allowing it to work well in a smaller kitchen and making storage a breeze.

### In the Box

*   1 x Jocuu masticating juicer body
*   Parts, including drum, feed chute, auger, juice mesh, plunger, drum cap
*   1 x juice cup 
*   1 x pulp cup
*   1 x wrench for securing drum cap
*   1 x cleaning brush
*   1 x user manual

The Jocuu comes with the usual components seen on a masticator, plus a wrench for  the first one for two times securing and removing the drum cap. The cardboard box is compact, but had enough cushion to keep all the parts intact when it arrived at our lab in Saigon after a long journey from the US.

### Dimensions & Footprint

Juice Cup Capacity: 24 fl. oz

Pulp Cup Capacity: 48 fl. oz

The Jocuu masticator is average in size, equipped with a motor and containers suitable for serving a household of 2-4 people. It can comfortably stay on a narrow countertop while in use or, when disassembled, be stored in a standard drawer, though it would likely completely fill it up.

We liked that the plunger covers the length of the feed chute but not the diameter, leaving ample wiggle room for the plunger. This proves to be a great design when juicing leafy greens—as a tighter space between the plunger and the feed chute wall can lead to leaves becoming snugly wedged, resulting in more severe clogging.

### 8.2 - Build Quality & Fit

The Jocuu has a look and design that matches its price, which is very basic. It’s made of durable materials, has decent finish, and the parts fit together well enough—only making squeaky noises when dealing with particularly tough ingredients. Just don’t expect it to be a decorative item on your countertop.

### 8.7 - Auger

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/juicers/jocuu-slow-masticating-juicer-auger-clvbwmld20003yx88clo02rhe.jpg" alt="The auger part of the Jocuu masticating juicer" width="300px" height="200px">

The Jocuu sports an average size auger with just the right space between its teeth, allowing it to handle the toughest ingredients with minimal clogging. The auger and drum size also gives it an interesting advantage: You can run the pulp through it again to get more juice, which would be impossible on a larger model, such as the Omega NC900.

Usability

The Jocuu offers a functional, albeit basic, juicing experience tailored for budget-conscious users. It works well with small to medium cuts of vegetables, but the small feed chute can't handle whole produce the way a larger model such as the Omega NC900 can. Juicing is straightforward, although assembling does involve a small learning curve. Cleaning takes no more than a few minutes, and the parts are dishwasher-friendly too.

### 8.3 - Assembling

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/juicers/jocuu-slow-masticating-juicer-assembling-clvbwmle2000fyx88ad3j8j5y.jpg" alt="Parts of the Jocuu masticating juicer" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/juicers/jocuu-slow-masticating-juicer-assembling-1-clvbwmldn0009yx88fu6r5cms.jpg" alt="Parts of the Jocuu masticating juicer" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/juicers/jocuu-slow-masticating-juicer-assembling-2-clvbwmktc0002yx88cwve56qq.jpg" alt="Removing the cap with a wrench" width="300px" height="200px">

Featuring a rather typical design, however, the Jocuu has a lock to secure its drum into the main body. This requires some intuition to align the two parts into the right position, which can pose a challenge for first-timers. Taking them apart is much easier, as it requires only the press of a button. The assembling and disassembling process can each take less than 1 minute once you’ve got the hang of it.

### 7.8 - Juicing

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/juicers/jocuu-slow-masticating-juicer-juicing-clvbwmldq000ayx88fxuac3mz.jpg" alt="Juicing celery with the Jocuu masticator" width="300px" height="200px">

While Jocuu’s rather modest feed chute means it can’t handle a whole or even half a carrot at once, as long as the ingredient is small enough to fit, it tends to pass through with ease. Jamming occurred mostly with tough fibers that the auger had difficulty cutting or breaking, causing the drum to "nod", but you can solve the problem by cutting the ingredients into smaller sticks or wedges.

### 3.0 - Conveniences

Reverse Feature: Yes

Speed Pressure Options: 2

Being a budget masticator, the Jocuu does not come with a lot of bells and whistles. It has two speed options for soft and hard vegetables and fruits, and a reverse function, all controlled by a turn of a knob. However, you need to wait a second or two in the neutral position when switching between normal juicing and reversing, or the motor won’t engage in reverse.

### 9.3 - Cleaning

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/juicers/jocuu-slow-masticating-juicer-cleaning-clvbwmldb0006yx88azwb4ow5.jpg" alt="gloved hand holding brush" width="300px" height="200px">

Dishwasher Safe: Yes

The Jocuu takes only a few minutes to clean manually, with its most challenging parts being the top of the auger and the juice mesh, where fibers tend to stick. We recommend taking the unit apart and submerging these parts in mild soapy water immediately after juicing for easy cleanup.
