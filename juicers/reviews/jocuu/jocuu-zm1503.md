The Jocuu masticating juicer may not boast a stylish design or all the bells and whistles, but it gets the job done decently. It handles most ingredients with ease, crushing them at a reasonable speed and yielding above-average results. The masticator does tend to produce foamy kale juice and may require finer pre-cutting for particularly tough and fibrous ingredients, but aside from that, juicing with it is a breeze. Assembling requires some practice, but disassembling and cleaning are straightforward and effortless.

Overall, this masticator is a solid product for its price. Given its size and capacity, it's best suited for use in a small household (2 - 4 people).
