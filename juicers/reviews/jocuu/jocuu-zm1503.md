The Jocuu masticating juicer may not boast a stylish design or all the bells and whistles, but it gets the job done decently. It handles most ingredients with ease, crushing them at a reasonable speed and yielding above-average results. The masticator does tend to produce foamy kale juice and may require finer pre-cutting for particularly tough and fibrous ingredients, but aside from that, juicing with it is a breeze. Assembling requires some practice, but disassembling and cleaning are straightforward and effortless.

Overall, this masticator is a solid product for its price. Given its size and capacity, it's best suited for use in a small household (2 - 4 people).

**Things We Like**

*   Affordable price
*   Two speed modes for soft/hard ingredients
*   Compact, modest footprint
*   Minimal clogging 
*   Easy cleanup

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Makes foamy kale juice 
*   Squeaks when juicing hard ingredients

The Jocuu masticator is a budget juicer that's been generating a lot of buzz recently. We purchased it in early 2023 and subjected it to weeks of testing in our lab to evaluate its performance, design, and ease of use. We assembled the parts and assessed how they fit together, measured the juice yield with various types of ingredients, evaluated the noise level during juicing, and disassembled the machine to wash it manually.

Read on to see how this juicer holds up to home use and fits into the rhythm of your daily life.

The Jocuu masticating juicer’s strong squeeze  allows it to handle thick, hard fruits and vegetables such as apples, carrots, and celery efficiently—yielding above-average juice within reasonable time frames. It had difficulty juicing kale, however: the yield was modest compared to other masticators, and you may require a separator or a smart cup to remove the foam.

The consolation is that you can run the pulp through it a second time to extract more juice (about 15-20%) from any of those ingredients.

### Carrot

Ingredient Weight: 18 oz

Juicing Time: 2 min 53 s

Yield: 6.95 oz (197 g)

Yield Percentage: 39%

Hard and dense, juicing carrots is easy, but the juice yield from carrots is the lowest among the four ingredients we tested on any masticator. The Jocuu took just shy of 3 minutes to process 18 ounces of carrot sticks, which is neither fast nor slow compared to other machines, earning it 7.8 points for juicing time. It produced nearly 7 ounces of juice, slightly higher than the average mark, and received 6.9 points for juice yield in this test.

### Apple

Ingredient Weight: 18 oz

Juicing Time: 2 min 28 s

Yield: 13.65 oz (387 g)

Yield Percentage: 77%

As hard as they may seem, apples are rich in liquid and relatively easy to juice, with the only challenging part being the tough and slippery peel. The Jocuu's auger, similar to that on its AMZChef twin, features a design that allows it to cut through the apple peel very efficiently, even surpassing the Omega NC900 in juicing time (earning 9 points). However, the juice yield (8.4 points) wasn't outstanding compared to the other masticator models we tested in this batch.

### Celery

Ingredient Weight: 18 oz

Juicing Time: 3 min 2 s

Yield: 9.91 oz (281 g)

Yield Percentage: 56%

The Jocuu didn't encounter many problems working through the tough fibers on the celery stalks or the soft leaves that accompanied them. It was 30 seconds slower than the AMZ Chef but faster than the Omega NC900 in this test, earning it a juicing time score of 8.5 points. The juice yield was average (6.0 points), lagging slightly behind the Omega, which scored 8.0 points.
