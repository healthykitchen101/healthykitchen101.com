Do you need a $400 masticating juicer, or would a $75 unit suffice? Scrolling through Amazon reviews, you’ll find both rave reviews and harsh critiques for both price points. To cut through the market clutter and identify the truly best juicer, we put all our juicers through the same set of tests, using identical ingredients. Beyond juicing time, juice yield, and quality, we scrutinize build quality and design, focusing on how these aspects enhance ease of use and assembly.

The purpose of our testing is to guide you through the nuances of choosing a masticating juicer that is not only effective but also a pleasure to use in your daily routine.

How We Rate Masticating Juicers
-------------------------------

The overall score is a rating on a scale of 1 to 10. Each of the three scoring categories is weighted to a different percentage:

*   Performance - 40%
*   Usability - 35%
*   Design - 25%

### 40% - Performance

We test the performance of each masticating juicer using four different ingredients: root (carrots), fruit (apples), fibrous vegetables (celery), and leafy greens (kale). Each of these take up 25% of the total performance score.

Scoring components for each ingredient include juice yield, juicing time, and for kale, foam level was also taken into account.

Our Juicer Performance Tests

### 35% - Usability

Ease of use is an important criterion when buying any household appliances, but especially so with juicers. Because juicing is usually not a “must” the way cooking is to most people, convenience arguably plays a more important role than juice yield or quality. A juicer can be very good at extracting juice, but if it’s too much trouble to use, chances are it will eventually find itself taking residence in a cupboard as soon as the “honeymoon phase” is over. 

The usability of a juicer is tied to its ease of assembly, juicing, and cleaning, and the convenient features that come with it. We examine these during our multiple trials and performance tests, and score each machine using an elaborate list of criteria.

#### 30% - Assembling

We evaluate how easily a juicer can be put together and taken apart, focusing on the design's simplicity and intuitiveness. A high score in this category means the juicer is straightforward to assemble and disassemble. We also check if the juicer is stable and safe when put together to reduce accident risks. Furthermore, we look at how compact the juicer is and if its parts can be easily moved, as this helps with storage and handling.

| Feature | Score |
| --- | --- |
| Intuitive design, simple to put together and take apart | +3 |
| Provides a safe and secure fit | +4 |
| Components are compact and easily movable | +3 |

#### 25% - Juicing

We examine whether the juicer operates efficiently without needing frequent assistance from the user, such as pressing down with a plunger or using the reverse button. Another factor of consideration is the juicer’s ability to accommodate larger pieces of produce, which reduces the need for extensive pre-cutting.

| Feature | Score |
| --- | --- |
| Does not require frequent pressing with the plunger | +4 |
| Does not easily jam or clog | +4 |
| Works with larger produce sizes | +2 |

#### 10% - Conveniences

We delve into the extra touches that elevate the user experience beyond just juicing basics. This assessment covers aspects such as the availability of a reverse function to prevent clogging, the variety of speed or pressure settings tailored to different produce types, the inclusion of an anti-froth feature to ensure cleaner juice, and a host of other convenient additions that ensure maximum efficiency.

| Feature | Score |
| --- | --- |
| Reverse feature | +3 |
| Speed/pressure options | +3 |
| Overheating indicator | +2 |
| Anti-froth feature | +1 |
| Miscellaneous | +1 |

#### 35% - Cleaning

We examine how fast and straightforward it is to clean the juicer after each juicing session. The inclusion of specialized brushes and tools designed to aid in the cleaning process can gain the juicer points, as does the dishwashability of its removable parts.

| Feature | Score |
| --- | --- |
| Easy to clean | +4 |
| Package includes tools for cleaning | +2 |
| Dishwasher safe parts | +4 |

### 25% - Design

A well-thought-out design is key to making a juicer both long-lasting and dependable. When we look at a juicer's design, we focus on three main things. First up is how well it's made and how nicely its parts fit together, with close attention to the materials and the craftsmanship. Then, we take a look at the juicer’s size and how much space it takes up, keeping an eye out for designs that are smart with space without compromising on functionality. Lastly, we dive into how the blade or auger works, making sure it's great at getting all the juice out and can handle all sorts of fruits and veggies.

#### 50% - Build Quality & Fit

We check if the juicer can withstand normal use without premature wear or damage. A juicer also gains points with a stylish design and polished finish, which add aesthetic appeal to the juicer, making it a desirable addition to any home.

| Feature | Score |
| --- | --- |
| Quality, durable materials | +3 |
| Secure fitting, no rattling noise during operation | +4 |
| Polished, seamless, residue-free finish | +2 |
| Stylish design | +1 |

#### 40% - Size & Footprint 

The dimensions and footprint of a juicer impact not just its portability and storage but also its functionality. We analyze the proportions of its components relative to each other and how this influences usability. Additionally, we assess the footprint of the assembled unit.

| Feature | Score |
| --- | --- |
| Substantial juice cup and pulp container in proportion to machine size | +2 |
| Parts fit inside a standard drawer | +3 |
| Assembled unit has a small footprint, allowing juicing on a countertop | +2 |
| Wide feed chute, allowing wiggle room for plunger | +2 |
| Wide food tray on feeding chute | +1 |

#### 10% - Blade/Auger

A juicer’s auger is scored for its construction quality and the way it is engineered to facilitate quick cutting and efficient crushing.

| Feature | Score |
| --- | --- |
| Robust build | +5 |
| Designed in a way that allows fast cutting and efficient crushing | +5 |
