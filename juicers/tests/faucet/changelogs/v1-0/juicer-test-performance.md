What It Is
----------

We test the juicer’s performance on four common ingredients, including carrots, apples, celery, and kale. Then, we evaluate its performance using three criteria: **juicing time**, **juice yield**, and **foam level**.

Why It’s Important
------------------

Some juicers are faster and more efficient than others at extracting juice from the fruits and vegetables you put into it, which saves you time and electricity, reduces waste, making them higher value buys in the long run. The quality of the juice produced is also an important factor: we need testing to see if a machine can make thick, smooth juice that is not overly coarse or foamy. 

Performance makes up **35**% of the total test score. 

The Ingredients 
----------------

To evaluate a juicer’s performance on various types of produce, we picked four common juicing ingredients of different texture and water content. Here’s the score weight for each type of ingredients and how we prep them.

### Carrots (25%)

Carrots are a popular ingredient for juicing thanks to their sweet, earthy taste and impressive nutrition profile.The root is known for its hard and dense texture, which can be a challenge for machines with a weak motor. 

For the test, we use 18 ounces of fresh carrots. We remove the two ends and cut the carrots into sticks 2- 3 inches long, 0.5 - 0.7 inch across.

### Apples (25%)

Featuring a sweet-sour taste and sweet fragrance, apples can make a delicious juice alone or an addition to other fruits or vegetables. The fruit is softer than carrots but still thick enough to juice. The challenge lies in the thin but tough and slippery skin, which requires sharp blades to cut. It’s not uncommon to see the skin of the apple slices stay untouched, clogging the drum or mesh of a juicer, or flying and breaking the plastic cover of a fast juicer.

We use 18 ounces of apples, cores removed but not peeled, cut into slices of 0.7-0.8 inch across.

### Celery (25%)

Celery is loved for its mild fragrance and low calorie content. The vegetable has a high water content but also a lot of long, tough fiber strings that are difficult to cut and tend to wrap around the auger or the end cap of a masticating juicer or stick on the mesh of a centrifugal one, causing clogs. 

For the test, we use 18 ounces of celery for each machine. That equals 500 grams, of which the stalks make up 420 grams and the leaves, 80 grams.

### Kale (25%)

One of the most famous nutrition powerhouse, this leafy green is also one of the hardest to juice due to its thin shape, tough, fibrous texture, and low water content. Most machines have difficulty breaking down the kale leaves and extracting the juice from this vegetable. The tough cell walls of kale can clog or strain the juicing machine, leading to reduced juice yield and potentially damaging the juicer.

For the test, we use 20 ounces of kale leaves with the stalk on. 

How We Test and Score
---------------------

### Trial Testing

Before _officially_ testing the machines, we ran trial tests with the first batch of juicers and recorded all data to make sure our tests help to bring out the features and pros and cons of each machine. In addition, these trial tests were an opportunity for us to get more familiar with the machines and learn the best tips and tricks to work with them. 

Once the tests have been finalized, we conducted and video-recorded them, logging in important figures for rating. Here’s a breakdown of the criteria when scoring each ingredient and their respective score weights.

### Carrots, Apples, and Celery

#### Juicing Time - 50%

We run the ingredients through the juicer, noting down the amount of time it takes to process each type of ingredients. 

The juicing time is then rated as follows.

| Juicing time | Score |
| --- | --- |
| 2:00 | 10 |
| 2:30 | 9 |
| 3:00 | 8 |
| 3:30 | 7 |
| 4:00 | 6 |
| 4:30 | 5 |
| 5:00 | 4 |
| 5:30 | 3 |
| 6:00 | 2 |
| 6:30 | 1 |
| 7:00 | 0 |

#### Juice Yield - 50%

We collect the juice produced by each juicer and run it through a strainer to remove any coarse pulp before weighing it on a scale. The juice:produce ratio, or juice yield percentage, is then calculated using the following formula:

Juice yield = Amount of juice in grams / 500 (amount of ingredient in grams) X 100%

Since the juice yield is different for each type of fruits or vegetables, we score them differently. The details are as follows.

**Celery**

| Yield | Score |
| --- | --- |
| 75% | 10 |
| 70% | 9 |
| 65% | 8 |
| 60% | 7 |
| 55% | 6 |
| 50% | 5 |
| 45% | 4 |
| 40% | 3 |
| 35% | 2 |
| 30% | 1 |
| 25% | 0 |

**Apple**

| Yield | Score |
| --- | --- |
| 85% | 10 |
| 80% | 9 |
| 75% | 8 |
| 70% | 7 |

| 55% | 4 |
| 50% | 3 |
| 45% | 2 |
| 40% | 1 |
| 35% | 0 |

**Carrot**

| Yield | Score |
| --- | --- |
| 55% | 10 |
| 50% | 9 |
| 45% | 8 |
| 40% | 7 |
| 35% | 6 |
| 30% | 5 |
| 25% | 4 |
| 20% | 3 |
| 15% | 2 |
| 10% | 1 |
| 5% | 0 |

### Kale

Due to its leafy, thin, and lightweight nature, kale requires specific machine features to juice, causing remarkable discrepancies in the speeds, juice yield, and juice quality among different juicer types and models. 

As such, the criteria for assessing the juicers are a little different when it comes to kale compared to other ingredients.

#### Juicing Time - 40%

Kale takes a longer time to juice than denser ingredients such as carrots or celery. As such, any juicer that takes 5 minutes or less to process 500 grams (18 ounces) of kale gets a score of 10.

| Juicing time | Score |
| --- | --- |
| 5:00 | 10 |
| 6:00 | 9 |
| 7:00 | 8 |
| 8:00 | 7 |
| 9:00 | 6 |
| 10:00 | 5 |
| 11:00 | 4 |
| 12:00 | 3 |
| 13:00 | 2 |
| 14:00 | 1 |
| 15:00 | 0 |

#### Juice Yield - 40%

With a masticating juicer, you can typically extract a decent amount of juice out of a fussy vegetable like kale. A unit that can make 25% or less juice by weight out of 500 grams of kale will fail the test, but every 5% more gains it 1 point.

| Yield | Score |
| --- | --- |
| 75% | 10 |
| 70% | 9 |
| 65% | 8 |
| 60% | 7 |
| 55% | 6 |
| 50% | 5 |
| 45% | 4 |
| 40% | 3 |
| 35% | 2 |
| 30% | 1 |
| 25% | 0 |

#### Foam Level - 20%

While the foam level was negligible with other ingredients, we found that it was not the case when juicing kale. Some of the juicer made extremely foamy kale juice—the volume of foam was oftentimes higher than the juice itself. This not only affects aesthetics, but potentially the juice quality. A high foam level also causes inconveniences as the juice cup overflows. That’s the reason foam level was part of the criteria when evaluating the efficiency of a masticator when juicing this leafy vegetable.

The foam level is determined by comparing the volume of foam with that of the juice made, both in milliliters, using the following formula: 

Foam level = Foam volume/Juice yield X 100%

The scoring table for foam level is as follows.

| Foam level | Score |
| --- | --- |
| o% | 10 |
| 10% | 9 |
| 20% | 8 |
| 30% | 7 |
| 40% | 6 |
| 50% | 5 |
| 60% | 4 |
| 70% | 3 |
| 80% | 2 |
| 90% | 1 |
| 100% | 0 |

Apart from juice yield, juicing time, and foam level, we also observed and collected data on the noise level, juice taste, texture, and time till separation, among other factors. However, we did not find differences that were significant enough to warrant a rating factor among those aspects.
