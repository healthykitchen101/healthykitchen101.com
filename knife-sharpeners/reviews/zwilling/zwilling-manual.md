The Zwilling 4-stage knife sharpener is more versatile than most, accommodating both Asian and standard knives. However, it offers a lower quality of performance than its robust construction, and price, suggest. It will improve your knife sharpness, but it takes its sweet time, and not without removing a considerable amount of steel from the knife edge. The device is easy to use but only if you have a very firm and steady grip.

**Things We Like**

*   Substantial weight
*   Sharpens both Asian and standard knives
*   Strong build, high-quality body material
*   Slot cover 
*   Beautiful design

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Brittle sharpening blades 
*   Anti-slip pad doesn’t fully cover the base
*   Awkward grip

We really wanted the Zwilling knife sharpener to succeed in our tests. For one, it’s from Zwilling, one of the most prestigious knife brands in the world — they _must_ know how to make an [effective sharpener](https://healthykitchen101.com/knife-sharpeners/reviews/best/). The device seems very well made and certainly looks and feels the upscale price to us. 

But there’s more to it than meets the eye, and in the case of the Zwilling, its performance doesn’t quite catch up with its cost or appearance. 

Here’s how our experiments with it turned out.

The Zwilling isn’t a complete failure: It can sharpen a dead, dull knife to highly serviceable keenness. However, it lost way too many points on speed, which is a critical criterion for convenient sharpeners. Its sharpening blades left a consistent edge, but that doesn’t make up for the excessive amount of material it removed doing so. It reminded us of the [Chef’s Choice 4643](https://healthykitchen101.com/knife-sharpeners/reviews/chefschoice/chefschoice-4643-manual/) in many ways.

### Sharpening Time to Cut a Lemon

Sharpening Time: 3 minutes

Cutting Feel: Slightly forced

The Zwilling is, sadly, one of the slower sharpeners even among its category. It took 180 seconds to sharpen a sandpaper-destroyed knife to the lemon-cutting level, and even then, the cutting motion didn’t feel completely effortless. Three minutes may feel like nothing if you’re used to working with a whetstone, but for a convenient device like this one, one would expect a much shorter time.

### Maximum Sharpness Achieved

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/knife-sharpeners/cl5rkp7qu000psf889zyy44c6.jpg" alt="ZWILLING Maximum Sharpness Achieved video" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/knife-sharpeners/cl5rl3px5000qsf889y3o90o9.jpg" alt="ZWILLING Maximum Sharpness Achieved video 1" width="300px" height="200px">

Sharpening Time: 6 minutes

Sharpness Level: 8 - (Chicken breast with skin, 2 swipes)

While it failed quite miserably in the speed test, the Zwilling sharpener got decent results when given more time. The test knife passed the tomato test with flying colors and could cut through the muscle and runny skin on a fresh piece of chicken breast with two light and easy swipes. 

We tried it on beef tendon too, which it took two heavy strokes to sever. The device was marked as failed for this level, but we think its efforts would be sufficient for most food prep needs.

### Edge Smoothness

Although the Zwilling peels a lot off the knife, we have to give it credit for the pretty edge it left. There are long and deep grooves along the edge—we could tell from the swarf alone—but overall, the edge is straight and consistent, and without visible chips or teeth. 

However, with its ceramic blades chipped after only a few uses, we’re at best skeptical about the device’s ability to maintain delivery of this edge quality.

### Material Retention

Sharpening Time: 1 minute

For the sharpness level it could achieve, the Zwilling shaves off way too much steel from the knife. We couldn’t help but shudder at the long curls of swarf coming out of the Coarse slot.

Most other devices employ ceramic rods for honing the knife, so even though this function comes in the form of blades on this sharpener, we really didn’t expect the ceramic to be so harsh on the knife edge.

Design
------

design Scores: **7.5**

*   Build Quality (75%) - **7.8**/10
    
*   Grip (25%) - **6.5**/10
    

The Zwilling sharpener has a robust construction; its frame is made with mostly high-quality materials and has an excellent fit and finish. Its most important components—the sharpening blades—however, seem to be made of the wrong material for the job. The tall, long, but narrow body, meanwhile, makes it more prone to losing balance and stability.

*   Instruction leaflet

The Zwilling 4-stage sharpener comes protected by a plastic blister pack, with a simple instruction manual. The device is solid and heavier than most others.

### Dimensions

### 7.8 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/knife-sharpeners/cl5qjcz8u000fsf88544269v7.jpg" alt="The Zwilling Henckels 4-stage knife sharpener standing on a surface" width="300px" height="200px">

While its design leaves a lot of room for improvement, the Zwilling is overall a robust, well-built sharpener. Its body feels rigid and solid, the frame and paddings are made of high-quality materials, and every part fits together nicely, leaving no gaps. 

Unfortunately, the device’s weakness is its most critical part: the ceramic sharpening blades. 

Normally, ceramic is used to make honing rods on pull-through sharpeners, but on the Zwilling, it’s employed in the shape of rectangular sharpening blades with their own delicate edges. The chipping we found on those blades after only a few days of testing proved that this break from the norm was an error of judgment. Obviously, being hard but brittle, the ceramic blades couldn’t withstand a rough steel knife edge.

### 6.5 - Grip

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/knife-sharpeners/cl5qjhdc0000gsf88cw2ognrk.jpg" alt="The grip of the Zwilling 4-stage knife sharpener" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/knife-sharpeners/cl5qjhn5a000hsf8866gwg7sb.jpg" alt="A hand holding the Zwilling knife sharpener and a hand resting on the table" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: ABS, EVA

The Zwilling’s grip looks and feels fancier than most other devices’, but we wish the design were more simple. The thumb holder was awkward to grasp, and both of us testers couldn’t seem to align our fingers with the finger nubs. 

We also thought the space between the grip and the base to be excessive — a lower height and center of gravity would immensely improve the device’s stability.

### Working Section

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/knife-sharpeners/cl5qjkcd9000isf88chr5f33e.jpg" alt="The working section of the Zwilling with 4 abrasive slots on a frame and its clear cover" width="300px" height="200px">

Levels of Sharpening: Sharpen, Polish

Abrasive: Ceramic blades

Mechanism: Pull through

Sharpening Angle: 15 degrees, 10 degrees

The Zwilling sharpener has a long working section, covering two types of edge angle: standard and Asian. We find the alleged grind angles of 15 and 10 degrees to be surprisingly small—standard knives typically come at 18-22 degrees and Asian knives, 13 - 15 degrees. An edge angle of 10 degrees is probably more appropriate for razors than kitchen knives.

Angles aside, we like how the working section is closer to the base than the rest of the device is. This helps lower the center of gravity even only by a little, and improves the overall balance.

### Base

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/knife-sharpeners/cl5qjnnzf000jsf886bpw85yl.jpg" alt="The Zwilling sharpener lying on a surface with its base in full view" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/knife-sharpeners/cl5qjnxhj000ksf88gjzn7pno.jpg" alt="The Zwilling sharpener’s base and base pad" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Plastic

Feet Type: EVA pad

The Zwilling sharpener has a solid, flat base, with a high-quality anti-slip pad underneath. But this is yet another area where it suffers from bad design.

The base is long and narrow, which is not ideal for its considerable height. The pad only partially covers the base, leaving its border hanging in the air— the pad basically adds height while further reducing the already modest width. As a result, the device is very prone to rocking.

Ease of Use
-----------

usability Scores: **8.2**

*   Slot Arrangement (20%) - **10**/10
    
*   Insertion (20%) - **9.0**/10
    
*   Pulling Through (10%) - **7.5**/10
    
*   Stability on a Clean Surface (40%) - **7.5**/10
    
*   Stability on a Wet and Dirty Surface (10%) - **6.0**/10
    

Though the Zwilling’s slot layout is not exactly basic, it’s easy to work with. Blade insertion is safe and simple. However, the actual sharpening process can be a little challenging as the device tends to rock on its narrow base pad.

### 10 - Slot Arrangement

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/knife-sharpeners/cl5qixzzy0009sf8876gceykz.jpg" alt="The working section on the Zwilling sharpener, with 4 slots featuring Coarse and Fine gits for standard and Asian knives" width="300px" height="200px">

The Zwilling has more sharpening slots than most others, but its layout is straightforward. Half of the working section is for standard blades and the other half Asian, as indicated by the print underneath. The slots progress in the same order for each angle type, with their coarseness level printed on their sides.

A transparent plastic cover can be slid over the area you’re not working on, so it’s rare that you will misplace your knife while sharpening.

### 9.0 - Insertion

It doesn’t have the widest slot openings, but insertion is still effortless with the Zwilling. Its lowered working section and the rather spacious grip do offer a sense of confidence and safety in this regard.

### 7.5 - Pulling Through

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/knife-sharpeners/cl5qj2xct000bsf881z0r9b9f.jpg" alt="2 hands holding and sharpening a kitchen knife with the Zwilling Henckels 4 stage knife sharpener" width="300px" height="200px">

The problem with abrasive blades is that sometimes they lose grip of the knife edge, letting it glide through untouched. The fact that its blades are made of ceramic instead of tungsten carbide as a typical sharpener’s would be doesn’t exempt the Zwilling from this issue. 

The thick frame around the slots, while offering great support, does obstruct the knife tip at the end as the downward force is still in place. It gets nicked from time to time, though this doesn’t affect the knife edge or sharpness.

### 7.5 - Stability on a Clean Surface

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/knife-sharpeners/cl5qj5anp000csf8847sdf11p.jpg" alt="2 hands holding and sharpening a kitchen knife with the Zwilling knife sharpener on a countertop" width="300px" height="200px">

The Zwilling’s heavy weight (a whopping 11 ounces) and solidness couldn’t cancel out the effect of its massive height to stabilize the device. Nor did its narrow base and an even narrower anti-slip pad allow it to fare well in our test. The sharpener kept losing its balance.

### 6.0 - Stability on a Wet and Dirty Surface

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/knife-sharpeners/cl5qj7is2000dsf88d9aicx87.jpg" alt="2 hands holding and sharpening a kitchen knife with the Zwilling 4-stage sharpener on a salt-sprinkled countertop" width="300px" height="200px">

The oil- and salt-tainted countertop only amplified all the design problems on the Zwilling. We could only keep it in place with excessive force on the grip, and so we highly recommend ensuring your countertop is dry and clean before using this sharpener.
