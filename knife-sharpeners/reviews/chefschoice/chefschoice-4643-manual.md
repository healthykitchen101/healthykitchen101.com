The Chef’s Choice 4643 AngleSelect Sharpener failed to live up to its reputation. The device itself is well built and comfortable to use, but it took too much time to sharpen and didn’t take our knife very far on the sharpness scale.

Given the high price tag and the mediocre performance, we wouldn’t go for this one when buying a sharpener.

**Things We Like**

*   Works with 20° and 15° edges
*   Compatible with serrated blades
*   Grippy handle
*   Neat, ergonomic overall design

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Expensive price
*   Awkward slot layout

Coming from the same brand that makes the famous Chef’s Choice Trizor XV, one of our [top picks for sharpeners](https://healthykitchen101.com/knife-sharpeners/reviews/best/), the **Chef’s Choice 4643 AngleSelect** belongs to the higher end of the price spectrum for manual sharpeners. Similar to its electric brethren, it has a sturdy, robust, well-balanced build that led us to have high hopes for it.

However, after a few months of testing and experimenting with the device, we’re not sure this Chef’s Choice would be another good choice.

The Chef’s Choice 4643 gave a subpar performance both in speed and sharpness level. It did not shave off too much steel, but it did not really do anything to the knife’s primary edge either.

### Sharpening Time to Cut a Lemon

Sharpening Time: 4 minutes

Cutting Feel: Slightly heavy

The Chef’s Choice took its sweet time to sharpen and was consistently among the slower ones in all our test attempts. It took a whopping 4 minutes to bring the test knife from uselessly blunt to adequately usable on a lemon. Even then, the knife needed a little more force than usual to execute the cut. You’d get better results within the same time using a whetstone.

We wouldn’t count on this one as a convenient sharpener to prep our knife before a cooking session.

### Maximum Sharpness Achieved

Sharpening Time: 6 minutes

Sharpness Level: 7 (Ripe tomatoes, 1 swipe)

The blade had no trouble slicing its way through a ripe tomato in one swift motion. The chicken breast posed much more difficulty: Its slippery skin made it impossible for the test knife to slice clean-off in one go. Two rather heavy attempts were needed to sever the pieces, so we decided to keep the Sharpness Level at 7 instead of 8-.

This sharpness level should allow your knives to complete most food prep tasks with mild effort, but we usually expect more from a device with such a high price tag. We can’t count the number of sharpeners that cost one half or even one third of its price that can offer a better performance.

### Edge Smoothness

Chef’s Choice advertises ‘two distinct facets set at different angles that form a longer lasting, arch-shaped edge’. The sharpener indeed created what looks like a double edge on our test knife. 

Unfortunately, while the secondary edge emerged sharp and convincing, the abrasives’ effects on the primary edge were so subtle they were unrecognizable even under a magnifying lens. The discs on the Honing slot were either too fine to make a difference or were placed at an angle that did not allow contact with the knife edge. 

That explains the lack of sharpness on the test knife—the secondary edge helps, but it can only do so much.

### Material Retention

Sharpening Time: 1 minute

The Chef’s Choice 4643 took off more steel from the test knife than its sharpness suggested, but the amount wasn’t significant. As typical of wheel-type sharpeners, the residue was fine dust rather than coarse shavings, suggesting highly controlled grinding.

Design
------

design Scores: **9.3**

*   Build Quality (75%) - **9.0**/10
    
*   Grip (25%) - **10**/10
    

This is the aspect where the Chef’s Choice 4643 really lives up to the brand’s reputation. The sharpener is well-built, ergonomic, and a delight to work with.

### In the Box

*   Chef’s Choice 4643 AngleSelect Knife Sharpener
*   1 x instruction manual

The Chef’s Choice snugly fits into a plastic blister pack with a user’s guide included (which is also [available online](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0064/4877/5232/t/3/assets/M6419304643manualGB-1590707959568.pdf)). The package can pop open quite easily, so there’s no need to cut it with scissors.

Besides the sharpening techniques, the manual also guides you on how to test the knife’s sharpness, and provides helpful tips to keep your knives in their best condition.

### 9.0 - Build Quality

Its materials do not scream ‘top-notch quality’, but the Chef’s Choice 4643 benefits greatly from an ergonomic design and robust build. The parts are well reinforced and screw-tightened, though it can be disassembled piece by piece. Finish is near perfect and matches its high price tag.

### 10 - Grip

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/knife-sharpeners/cl57zyjpn000e258806fd5btn.jpg" alt="A hand holding the Chef’s Choice manual knife sharpener" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Rubber

The handle extends and slightly arches itself toward the end, forming an ergonomic crescent-like shape. It’s just about the perfect size, and the coating material feels soft and grippy between the palm and fingers. Unfortunately, the handle isn’t loop-shaped. Otherwise, you’d be able to hang it on a hook to keep it within an arm’s reach.

### Working Section

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/knife-sharpeners/cl5805rt9000f2588efmw9pxi.jpg" alt="The working section of the Chef's Choice with 3 abrasive slots on a frame and part of its handle and base" width="300px" height="200px">

Levels of Sharpening: Coarse, Fine

Abrasive: Diamond-coated disks

Mechanism: Pull through

Sharpening Angle: 15° & 20°

The Chef’s Choice 4643’s working section features three sharpening slots that are securely fastened into the base and covered in a shiny stainless steel sheet.

Unlike most manual sharpeners with abrasive bars or rods, it’s equipped withdiamond-coated discs. As the blade passes through them, these wheels rotate with each draw, grinding and reshaping the edge. 

Slot 1 sharpens Asian knives at a 15-degree angle while Slot 2 sharpens Western knives at 20 degrees. 

Interestingly, there’s only one slot for honing (Slot 3) for both types of knives, but the exact grinding angle isn’t mentioned in the manual. We asked the official manufacturer in an email but have so far received no response.

### Base

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/knife-sharpeners/cl599xd830000am880rq08e5z.jpg" alt="The underneath of the Chef's Choice sharpener" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/knife-sharpeners/cl599z1ut0001am88c26qdprs.jpg" alt="One of the feet underneath the Chef's Choice sharpener" width="300px" height="200px">

Material: Synthetic rubber

Feet Type: Slip-proof sole (x 4)

With the bottom being a hollow gap instead of a solid whole block, the sharpener is lightweight. However, because the base is wide and the center of gravity low, it maintains its balance very well. 

The quartet of rubber feet attached at the base corners do a great job of creating friction and keeping the device in place during sharpening—we feel this is a more economical and effective design than the large pads usually seen in other devices.

Ease of Use
-----------

usability Scores: **8.4**

*   Slot Arrangement (20%) - **7.0**/10
    
*   Insertion (20%) - **8.5**/10
    
*   Pulling Through (10%) - **8.5**/10
    
*   Stability on Clean Surface (40%) - **9.5**/10
    
*   Stability on a Wet and Dirty Surface (10%) - **7.0**/10
    

The Chef’s Choice 4643 is one of the safest and most comfortable sharpeners to use. Just make sure you do not sharpen in the wrong slot.

### 7.0 - Slot Arrangement

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/knife-sharpeners/cl57xtez6000425883swa8tiv.jpg" alt="The Chef’s Choice 4643 manual knife sharpener viewed from the side" width="300px" height="200px">

The sharpener has labeling for the slots’ functions and designated knife types. Depending on the knife you’re sharpening, the intended order goes as 1-3 (for Asian-style knives) or 2-3 ( for European-style knives).

The slot trios share the identical size, width, and depth, so it’s easy to confuse them. We strongly advise you to look at the labeling carefully before sharpening your knives, especially during the first sessions with the device.

While the Western slot can only blunt an Asian knife, putting your standard knife in the Asian slot can destroy the edge beyond the point of repair. We actually had to throw away a test knife trying that out.

### 8.5 - Insertion

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/knife-sharpeners/cl57y0dmn00062588dlrmez26.jpg" alt="Close up view of the Chef’s Choice sharpener’s sharpening slots 1, 2, and 3" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/knife-sharpeners/cl57y3w9t00072588hsi132eu.jpg" alt="The working section on the Chef's Choice, with 3 slots featuring diamond-coated abrasive discs" width="300px" height="200px">

The Chef’s Choice has rather narrow slot openings, so if you’re in a rush, there’s a chance you’ll misplace the knife and cut the cover instead of inserting it into the slot. 

On the bright side, once the knife is at the opening, it’ll be smooth sailing. Because the slots taper downwards and the discs are placed deep below, the knife will slide straight down. Insertion is thus much safer for the knife edge compared to sharpeners with tungsten bars that keep threatening to clash with the edge and cause chipping.

### 8.5 - Pulling Through

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/knife-sharpeners/cl57ybwem000825883moof3i7.jpg" alt="One of the abrasive slots on the Chef’s Choice 4643 with cutting marks on it" width="300px" height="200px">

Because the slots are deep and run all the way across its width (2 inches), it was relatively easy to keep the knife straight during sharpening to reduce the risk of creating uneven edges. 

That being said, there’s some room for the knife to jig sideways; when it does, you will feel a change in the friction as you pull the blade through. 

As its discs are placed deep down in the slots, the knife kept nicking into the frame, leaving lots of marks and scratches.

### 9.5 - Stability on Clean Surface

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/knife-sharpeners/cl57yfurr000925883lhn0z32.jpg" alt="2 hands holding and sharpening a kitchen knife with the Chef's Choice sharpener" width="300px" height="200px">

This is one of the rare devices that come without a full base and can still offer excellent stability. Despite being lightweight, the sharpener stayed secure and steady on a spotless kitchen countertop, thanks to its well-proportioned structure. Those with weak wrists or shaky hands will really feel a difference with this design.

### 7.0 - Stability on a Wet and Dirty Surface

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/knife-sharpeners/cl57ym9cj000a2588bdd164fg.jpg" alt="2 hands holding and sharpening a kitchen knife with the Chef's Choice on a salt-sprinkled countertop" width="300px" height="200px">

Moving on to the simulated messy countertop splashed with cooking oil and peppered with salt: The sharpener’s balanced design continued to keep its footing. The base did lose its traction with the contact surface and moved along with the pull, but only occasionally and not to the extent seen on most other sharpeners.
