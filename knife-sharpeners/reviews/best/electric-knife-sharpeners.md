Electric knife sharpeners are helpful and convenient tools that make quick work of dull blades. These machines can truly come to the rescue when whetstones are too much trouble and manual devices won’t cut it. Of course, there are unique downsides to each device, and it can be a little tricky to pick the right one.

We’ve tested quite a few electric sharpeners. Here, we will share our assessments of their performance and usability to help you choose the best one. We will also discuss the features that make some electrical sharpeners more efficient than others.

1\. Best Overall: Work Sharp Ken Onion

*   It accommodates different edge angles and blade types
*   You’re in control of the speed 
*   It can produce a mirror-like finish
*   It works on various tools other than kitchen knives

*   It throws dust into the air 
*   There’s a learning curve
*   It’s tricky to get even bevels

We’ve tested eight electric sharpeners so far and the Work Sharp Ken Onion performed the best by leaps and bounds. We have yet to find another that is as versatile and produces such a fine edge. On the other hand, it’s more difficult to use than most but the results are well worth the extra effort. 

Our test knife was a cheap stainless steel knife that began life at Sharpness Level 8 on our [Practical Sharpness Scale](https://healthykitchen101.com/knife-sharpeners/tips/sharpness-scale/). After destroying it with sandpaper, we could resurrect the knife to a Level 9 using the Ken Onion Knife Sharpener. It glided through a thick string of raw beef tendon like butter! 

This machine produced a smoother edge with better edge height than any other electric sharpener. The edge texture was comparable to that produced by a series of whetstones, except the Ken Onion was much quicker and required less skill. 

We could pick out the Ken Onion’s work from a pile of test knives based on the shiny reflection on the edge alone. You just need to pay attention while sharpening to create even bevels on both sides.

Unlike any other electric sharpener, the Ken Onion has five abrasive belts for producing different coarseness levels. You can customize the edge angle anywhere between 15 and 30 degrees, and adjust the belt speed to suit different types of knives.

 It works on big and small kitchen knives, Asian and Western blades, straight and serrated edges, and even things like gutting hooks! If you’re serious about your blades, this is definitely the best electric knife sharpener that you can get for them.

Of course, with so much customization, there’s more to do than just switching on the machine. It will take a few sessions before the process feels natural. 

On a cautionary note, while overheating is not an issue, noise and dust can be a problem. Unlike a semi-closed design like the Chef’s Choice Trizor XV, the Ken Onion is completely open. Just remember to wear protective glasses and a mask while restoring your knife collection joyfully back to life.

2\. Best Easy-to-Use: Chef’s Choice Trizor XV Electric Sharpener

*   Strong, solid build, great stability
*   Excellent sharpness
*   Long operation time without overheating
*   Sleek design
*   Easy setup and cleanup
*   Long warranty (3 years)

*   No grind angle options
*   Shaves off a lot of knife material

The Chef’s Choice Trizor XV is neither the fastest nor most versatile electric knife sharpener, but it definitely secures a top spot in our rankings. It’s simple design and nice safety features guarantee you professional sharpness with little effort..

Unlike the Work Sharp Ken Onion, the learning curve with the Trizor XV is comfortably flat. All you need to do is flip the switch and sharpen! 

This sharpener produced a sharp and fine edge with substantial height. It did, however, shave off a significant amount of steel from the blade. Thus, we can confirm rumors about it being harsh on the knife’s life expectancy. Ultimately, though, a [good edge height correlates to better retention](https://knifesteelnerds.com/2018/06/18/maximizing-edge-retention/). This means the knife will stay sharper for longer, so you’d likely still win in the long run.

Instead of basic sharpening slits seen on most other machines, the Chef’s Choice Trizor XV incorporates spring-loaded angle guides to keep a precise and consistent sharpening angle. The machine is steady and stable—we never experienced stalling nor did it push at the blade like the [EdgeKeeper](https://healthykitchen101.com/knife-sharpeners/reviews/edgeKeeper/edgekeeper-b084lmsdbl/) (another diamond-disc electric sharpener). Sharpening was always smooth sailing.

Furthermore, the magnetic plate does an excellent job of containing metal shavings and the machine is not prone to overheating. 

The Chef’s Choice, of course, does come with limitations. Chiefly, it operates at only one rotational speed. Unsteady or unpracticed hands can produce unevenness along the knife edge and you can’t increase speed for harder knives. Additionally, the angle is set at 15 degrees which works great for most kitchen knives, but not for maintaining the original strength of a cleaver or the delicacy of a filet knife.

The Chef’s Choice Trizor XV is one of the [best knife sharpeners](https://healthykitchen101.com/knife-sharpeners/reviews/best/) to buy if you need sharp, strong knife edges without too much hassle. If you’re a knife connoisseur, however, the Work Sharp Ken Onion will still be a better choice.

3\. Best Value: Presto Eversharp Electric Sharpener

*   Quick sharpening
*   Good bevel height
*   Affordable price
*   Simple setup

*   It creates lots of fine dust

For those looking for an affordable electric sharpener with decent performance, the Presto 08800 Eversharp is your best choice. It lacks the versatility and sleekness of our top two contenders, but does a great job at one third of the price.

In our speed test, the Presto Eversharp actually outperformed our top two contenders. It took one minute less than the Trizor XV to restore a dull edge and with comparable straightness and height!

Admittedly, its coarse stones produced a less refined surface texture. In the cutting test it required slightly more effort to slice through beef tendon. However, that was with better sharpness compared to out of the box.

Despite the amateurish look of the sharpening slots, it’s easy to insert your knife and maintain a consistent grind angle. The sharpening process was comfortable and effortless. 

Our tests suggest that as long as you don’t apply excessive pressure, the Presto can run 25 minutes straight without stalling. The machine does get quite hot; however, it’s steady and doesn’t need stabilizing with your hand.. 

The Presto EverSharp looks as basic as its sub-$50 price tag would suggest. However, we could see quality in both the materials and workmanship. It’s very function-oriented with no shoddy parts nor gimmicky details. Ours has continued to run without issue well beyond the warranty period, though admittedly we mostly used it for testing.

Other Electric Sharpeners We’ve Tested
--------------------------------------

#### 1\. [Narcissus](https://healthykitchen101.com/knife-sharpeners/reviews/narcissus/narcissus-qn-m801/)

The Narcissus features a robust and attractive build and offers decent performance despite the affordable price. It’s the quietest electric sharpener we’ve tested and also gained a higher score than most in dust control. 

Its main shortcoming is in the overheat protection mechanism, which keeps switching the machine off after only a few minutes—barely enough time to sharpen just one knife. Also, its abrasive design keeps it from thoroughly sharpening the whole blade of a smaller knife.

#### 2\. [EdgeKeeper](https://healthykitchen101.com/knife-sharpeners/reviews/edgeKeeper/edgekeeper-b084lmsdbl/)

A budget-friendly price and a pretty design are the EdgeKeeper’s main—and unfortunately also its only—strengths. While the edge it produced was sharp enough, the bevel texture was the worst we’ve seen from an electric sharpener. The machine’s exterior is made with low-quality materials and the motor overheats easily (to as high as 157 °F). It lasted only a few weeks and kicked the bucket during our continuous working time test.

How We Test Electric Knife Sharpeners
-------------------------------------

There are certain things that make for a good electric knife sharpener. Using our own hands-on experience as well as a careful study of customer reviews and discussion forums, we set out a list of criteria for electric sharpeners and designed tests to bring their characteristics to light.

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/knife-sharpeners/clbyk482r00156288aib595hp.jpg" alt="6 electric knife sharpeners, test knives on towel, paper and pen on cutting board, sandpapers, tissue box, extension socket." width="768" height="512">

We have a full breakdown of our [Test Methodology](https://healthykitchen101.com/knife-sharpeners/tests/electric/) if you’d like to dig into the nitty gritty. But to cut the long story short, here are some of the most prominent criteria and testing processes.

### Performance: Is It Quick to Produce a Sharp, Strong Edge?

Using sandpaper, we blunted a test knife until it could no longer tear through printer paper. Then we sharpened the knife on the electric sharpener until it could cut through a string of raw beef tendon.

With that, we determined the speed of the machine and how much material it removes from the knife. We also rated the quality of the knife edge based on its smoothness, bevel height, and bevel evenness. 

Each sharpener also went through a test where we sharpened with it for 25 minutes straight. This helped us determine if the machine is able to handle multiple knives consecutively, which is how people typically use their electric sharpeners.

### Safety & Ease of Use: Is It Straightforward to Work With?

We rated how safe each electric knife sharpener appeared based on the levels of noise and heat a machine produced during sharpening as well as its ability to control metal dust. Ease of use was determined based on how easy the machine was to set up and use, how long the warranty lasts, and whether it is possible to find replacement parts online.

### Design: What Knife Types Can It Handle?

We took into account the quality of materials and workmanship of each machine. Its versatility — the ability to handle different knife sizes, edge types, and edge angles — was also tested and rated.

How to Use an Electric Sharpener
--------------------------------

Most electric knife sharpeners are very simple to use. However, they’re quick and it’s easier to destroy a knife edge with an electric unit than through other methods of sharpening. Also, because they run on electricity, there are some other potential hazards. 

Not all electric sharpeners are the same, so we strongly advise you to read the manufacturer-provided instructions on how to use and maintain your specific machine. The manual usually includes tips on sharpening various types of knives and how to get the most out of your device.

For those who are not familiar with the machines, here’s a general guideline on how to sharpen with an electric sharpener.

### Precautions

1.  Electric sharpeners can produce loud noises and a lot of fine metal dust. Make sure you wear a dust mask, glasses, and earplugs when sharpening. Though they don’t usually get hot enough to cause burns, it’s a good idea to wear gloves anyway; you’re working with sharp blades and electronics, after all.
2.  These machines can toss metal dust into the air in all directions, so it’s best to do your sharpening far away from food, cookware, or utensils.
3.  The contact between abrasives and metal blades can occasionally produce sparks. Make sure there are no flammable materials nearby where you’re sharpening. Below is a generalized operating procedure for using an electric sharpener. Because of immense differences in design, the Work Sharp Ken Onion (and any similar belt-operated device) follows a different procedure. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for such sharpeners.

### Steps

1\. Start by thoroughly cleaning your knives. Make sure you remove any residue, dust, oil, or moisture before you start sharpening.

2\. Place the electric sharpener on the countertop or table top. Check to make sure it’s facing you in the right direction. Plug it in.

3\. Select the right sharpening angle for your knife and adjust the sharpening speed, if applicable.

4\. Flip the switch to turn the sharpener on.

5\. Select the proper starting slot based on the manufacturer’s suggestions. Usually, you’ll start with the coarse slot if you’re sharpening or use only the fine slots if you’re just honing the knife.

6\. Holding the knife handle, insert your knife into the sharpener starting at the heel. Keep its spine parallel to the table surface.

7\. Carefully pull the knife blade toward you at 1 inch per second until the whole length of the blade has passed through the slot. Do not apply pressure as you move. Make sure that you keep the blade at the same angle at all times. Afterwards, pull the knife through the slot for the other side of the blade.

Alternate between the two slots about four times. Test the knife edge on a piece of printer paper—if the cut appears too ragged, run the knife through the coarse slots a few more times.

8\. Progress to the finer slots with two to three pairs of pulls on each stage.

9\. Continue sharpening your other knives as necessary until you finish or you reach the sharpener’s rated working time limit. If necessary, turn the machine off for about 15 minutes to let it cool before continuing the sharpening session.

10\. Once you’ve finished sharpening, turn the machine off and unplug it. Using a dry towel, wipe dust off the sharpener before storing it.

11\. Wash your knives in soapy water and wipe them dry. Clean the table.

The frequency with which your knives need to be sharpened depends on their use. A blade that’s used often or used to cut very tough materials will need it more often. If you’re a home cook, your knives likely don’t need to meet the sharpener more than once a month.
