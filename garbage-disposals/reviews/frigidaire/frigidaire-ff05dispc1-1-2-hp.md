The Frigidaire FF05DISPC1 1/2 HP misses more than it hits. Offering an affordable price, good construction quality, and strong grinder materials, the garbage disposal should have been a great option if its motor were more efficient and the grinding components, particularly the two impellers, were fitted better.

It’s difficult to recommend the FF05DISPC1 when there are clearly better-performing [models from other brands](https://healthykitchen101.com/garbage-disposals/reviews/best/) on the market right now.

**Things We Like**

*   Removable splash guard
*   Decent capacity
*   Stainless steel grind components
*   Noise cancellation padding
*   Affordable

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   No external unjam mechanics
*   Jammed impellers during testing

The Frigidaire FF05DISPC1 1/2 HP is a presentable garbage disposal, boasting a sleek and thick plastic protective case. The disposal’s body framework is quite impressive for a budget low-power model. Although it was quite a fresh name on the market, everything about the grinder up until testing suggested attention to detail and quality workmanship.

Contradicting our expectations, the results collected from testing the Frigidaire FF05DISPC1 1/2 HP were not encouraging at all. In the final turn of evaluation, the disposal only passed one out of the three evaluation tests. It failed the two more difficult tests, which was somewhat expected from the likes of small garbage disposals. Fortunately, the data was useful in helping pinpoint where the disposal’s functionality should lie.

### Scrap Mix

Time: 2 min 45 sec

Layer 1: 11.7 oz (331 g)

Layer 2: 11.6 oz (329 g)

Leftovers: 0.1 oz (3 g)

The Frigidaire FF05DISPC1 garbage disposal did a good job of breaking down all kinds of scraps into tiny pieces, leaving only a negligible amount of materials in the chamber. With an efficiency rate of more than 99%, the disposal would score a lot higher in this test if it could manage finer output. The leftovers also showed that fish bones remained intact while chicken bones were crushed.

### Raw Fish Scraps

It was no surprise that the FF05DISPC1 couldn't handle raw fish leftovers. The test is particularly difficult, and we’ve seen more advanced and powerful models have struggled with it in the past. The disposal and its basic features are not designed to handle difficult materials such as slimy fish skin and flexible bones.

### Raw Chicken Scraps

The FF05DISPC1 couldn’t even break down all the bony parts, let alone the cartilage and fatty skin. The disposal simply wasn’t capable of bringing the input materials down to a safe amount. All it could do was strip off some of the residual meat on the bones.

The Frigidaire FF05DISPC1 1/2 HP features a sleek-looking body that feels rigid and closely fitted. The protective casing is made of strong plastic that has a thickness to it. Underneath, there’s a layer of acoustic foam to treat loud noises. 

The disposal also offers long-lasting grinding components in the chamber and a motor that delivers high speeds. But after performance evaluation, the motor turned out much less capable than we’d initially thought, and much slower compared to similar models, too.

Length: 5.6" (14.2 cm)

Width: 5.9" (15.0 cm)

Height: 12.8" (32.5 cm)

Weight: 8.3 lbs (3.8 kg)

The Frigidaire FF05DISPC1 is a highly compact unit that should fit in cabinets of all sizes. It’s one of the smallest models we’ve tested. The disposer is also very lightweight and should only add minimal burden to the sink.

### Mount Assembly

If you're replacing another 3-bolt garbage disposal, the Frigidaire FF05DISPC1 1/2 HP should be easy to install. However, if this is your first time with a 3-bolt mounting set, taking it apart may seem intimidating, particularly when it comes to the snap ring mechanism. Because of this, make sure to take some time to familiarize yourself with the assembly and refer to the manual instructions for helpful information.

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/frigidaire-1-2-hp-garbage-disposal-power-cord-clhhg0iob000g3p88639yf14m.jpg" alt="Type B power cord of Frigidaire FF05DISPC1 1/2-HP Garbage Disposal." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 34.3" (87.1 cm)

Type: 3-prong (B)

The disposal comes with a pre-installed cord, which is convenient if you have a power supply in the sink cabinet. If you want to hardwire the unit, you must manually remove the power cord.

### Accessories: Discharge Set

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/frigidaire-1-2-hp-garbage-disposal-accessories-clhhg1dkg000h3p883iet7wfp.jpg" alt="Standard outlet/discharge set for garbage disposals on granite-looking top, showing elbow pipe, rubber gasket, flange, bolts." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 5.3" (13.3 cm)

Material: PVC

A standard 1.5-inch elbow pipe, a rubber gasket, and a kit of flange and bolts complete the discharge set of the Frigidaire FF05DISPC1. The bolts have Phillip drives and hex heads.

### 7.5 - Grind Chamber

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/frigidaire-1-2-hp-garbage-disposal-grind-chamber-clhhg2dok000i3p88g7qkguod.jpg" alt="Top view into chamber of Frigidaire FF05DISPC1 garbage disposal after testing, showing layout of grinding components." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/frigidaire-1-2-hp-garbage-disposal-grind-chamber-1-clhhg2vi3000j3p88ahfmdy63.jpg" alt="Grind chamber of Frigidaire FF05DISPC1 garbage disposal, showing two-level grinder ring and details on flywheel." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/frigidaire-1-2-hp-garbage-disposal-grind-chamber-2-clhhg3bfu000k3p88a0te6zvp.jpg" alt="Grind chamber of Frigidaire FF05DISPC1 garbage disposal, showing impellers and details of flywheel and grinder ring." width="300px" height="200px">

Capacity: 27.0 fl oz (798.5 ml)

Verticality: 5.9" (15.0 cm)

Flywheel: 4.4" (11.2 cm)

Assembly Material: Stainless steel

Layout: Basic

The Frigidaire FF05DISPC1 1/2 HP enjoys a comfortable grinding chamber for its power range. The grinding assembly inside is a modest set with basic details. Compared to regular permanent magnet disposals, the design of the parts here is a little different: There are fewer cut-out holes on the flywheel and the impellers are fitted a bit too high as the gap beneath is enough for food particles to get stuck under, especially bones.

### 8.0 - Motor

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/frigidaire-1-2-hp-garbage-disposal-motor-cloy00ing000hfi88d618c5sf.jpg" alt="A digital tachometer is measuring the speed of the motor/flywheel of the Frigidaire 1/2 HP Corded garbage disposal in our speed test.

Horsepower: 1/2

Speed: 2600 RPM

Real Speed: 3706 RPM

Voltage: 120 V (60 Hz)

Current: 4.5 A

Wattage: 540 W

Heat: N/a

Reverse: No

On paper, the Frigidaire FF05DISPC1 1/2 HP’s motor is supposed to be as fast as the [GE Disposall Green](https://healthykitchen101.com/garbage-disposals/reviews/ge/ge-disposall-green-1-2-hp/). But in reality, when we measured the speed of the spinning flywheel, the Frigidaire was roughly 20% slower. Although this could mean better torque, through performance evaluation, apparently there isn’t any compensation towards that, either.

### 8.5 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/frigidaire-1-2-hp-garbage-disposal-build-quality-clhhg4e5f000l3p885ysdg98f.jpg" alt="Frigidaire FF05DISPC1 garbage disposal with 3-Bolt Mount assembly on top and outlet/discharge set installed." width="300px" height="200px">

Noise Reduction: Yes

Vibration Reduction: No

The Frigidaire FF05DISPC1 is a garbage disposal with good workmanship, providing a sturdy and reliable feeling throughout. The body is made of high-quality plastic reinforced with a strong structure, while a layer of acoustic foam wraps around the grinder's core to reduce noise levels.

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **NaN**

*   Installation (30%) - **9.5**/undefined

*   Smooth Operation (25%) - **7.0**/undefined
    
*   Unjam Mechanics (5%) - **0**/undefined
    

The Frigidaire FF05DISPC1 1/2 HP is a very restricted food disposer unit. Sure it can handle common food scraps quite well, but the impellers are easily lodged when there are hard food bits (such as bones). It has happened more than once since we started testing the disposer. Not to mention the fact that the disposer is not very strong.

### 8.0 - Ease of Use

The Frigidaire FF05DISPC1 can handle a handful of foods except for harder ones like fish or chicken bones, even when cooked. Avocado pits and other fruits and vegetable discards won't be too much of a problem, as long as the amounts are reasonable. The chamber can be too narrow for long pieces of scraps like veggie stems or stalk vegetables.

### 9.5 - Installation

The disposer is fairly easy to install given that you already have a 3-bolt mounting assembly. Its compact size and minimal weight shouldn’t give you any trouble, even in tight spaces. 

On a side note, if you do use the assembly that comes with the FF05DISPC1, be careful not to bend the details on the lower mounting ring when you lock the disposal in place. The material that makes the pieces of this particular set is noticeably more bendable than other sets that we’ve worked with.

_(tips: \*For safety reasons, you should ALWAYS set up to control your garbage disposal via a dedicated switch with a clear “Off” position.)_

### 7.0 - Smooth Operation

The Frigidaire FF05DISPC1 has not been giving us the most consistent performance. Aside from the fact that it’s a small unit, the disposal’s grinding power and the design of its grinding chamber have failed to deliver usable data several times. However, if you pick your battle, the disposal can still be utilized to a certain extent.

### Failed - Unjam Mechanics

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/frigidaire-1-2-hp-garbage-disposal-unjam-mechanics-clhhjylm200113p884kyjc8ug.jpg" alt="Inside view of permanent-magnet garbage disposal showing manual unjam mechanics with wooden stick in flywheel’s opening/gap." width="300px" height="200px">

External: No

Auto Unjam: No

If jamming happens, you can use a stick to rotate the flywheel through the sink collar.
