The InSinkErator Evolution Excel Garbage Disposal 1 HP is a top-tier in-sink grinder. With premium features such as a high-torque motor, an augmented chamber, and an advanced insulation system, it stands head and shoulders above most others. It’s the only model that we feel confident recommending when dealing with raw meat scraps.

Although all of that comes at a price, the Excel’s satisfying operation feels well worth the investment. The only thing to watch out for is the machine’s hefty weight and somewhat complicated setup process.

**Things We Like**

*   Noise cancelation
*   Vibration damping
*   High-torque motor
*   Advanced chamber layout
*   Auto-unjam mechanics
*   Extra high capacity
*   Stainless steel grinding components

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Extra heavy
*   Space-consuming
*   No power cord
*   Expensive

At first glance, the Evolution Excel struck us as a competent unit that is made for the biggest and most trying loads of scraps. Its solid-looking build suggests powerful performance and its one-of-a-kind grinding assembly seems reliable. The disposal is not particularly big for its power rating, but it is really heavy.

Performance: Almost Perfect
---------------------------

performance Scores: **9.4**

*   Scrap Mix (50%) - **9.8**/10
    
*   Raw Fish Scraps (25%) - **9.3**/10
    
*   Raw Chicken Scraps (25%) - **8.5**/10
    

Across all three challenging tests, the Excel both met and exceeded our expectations. Nothing we had prepared could hold it back—not the eleven types of food including fruit pits and chicken bones, and not even the tough uncooked fish scraps. 

The disposal was impressive in how well it ground down everything and also how quick it was. It may cost more, but the Evolution Excel is no doubt the [best-performing in-sink grinder](https://healthykitchen101.com/garbage-disposals/reviews/best/) that we’ve tested.

### Scrap Mix

Time: 10

40% \* 10 = 4.0

Layer 1: 10

35% \* 10 = 3.5

Layer 2: 9.3

25% \* 9.3 = 2.3

Time: 2 min

Layer 1: 0.7 oz (19 g)

Layer 2: 7.2 oz (203 g)

Leftovers: 0.3 oz (8 g)

The InSinkErator Evolution Excel outperformed its peers and had no trouble with 90 ounces (roughly 2.5 kilograms) of assorted food scraps. It only took about 2 minutes to process almost everything in its chamber and left behind just 0.3% of the input. 

The output was incredibly well-processed with an almost mulch-like texture. The disposal was even able to catch and break up thin and flexible fish bones that all other disposers struggled with. Less than 1% of the total mass got caught in Layer 1, and an extra 7.7% in Layer 2.  

Our data shows that the disposal can pulverize huge amounts of material very quickly while maintaining consistent output. In fact, the Evolution Excel beats its nearest competitor by leaps and bounds.

### Raw Fish Scraps

Layer 1: 4.9 oz (140 g)

Layer 2: 2.3 oz (65 g)

Leftovers: 0.1 oz (3 g)

As the toughest out of our three performance tests, we expected the Raw Fish Scraps to give the disposal a run for its money. However, with less than 0.3% leftovers from the 49.4 ounces of raw bones, skin, and other tissues, the Evolution Excel showcased one of the two best results we’ve collected so far. 

After 3 minutes, the only thing left was a tiny pile of skin with a few pieces of shredded back bones caught in between. Furthermore, very little was captured by our evaluation colanders. 

This particular run highlights how effective the Excel’s chamber design can be at shredding tough but flexible scraps like fish bones. Very few models come close to the disposal’s results.

### Raw Chicken Scraps

Layer 1: 7.9

20% \* 7.9 = 1.6

Layer 2: 8.5

15% \* 8.5 = 1.3

Leftovers: 9.2

40% \* 9.2 = 3.7

Time: 2 min 30 sec

Layer 1: 0.7 oz (19 g)

Layer 2: 1.1 oz (30 g)

Leftovers: 0.2 oz (5 g)

The InSinkErator Evolution Excel tops the chart against uncooked chicken scraps. In about 2 minutes 30 seconds, the disposal was able to reduce 7.4 ounces of defleshed chicken thighs down to 0.19 ounces worth of boney bits and soft tissues. That translates to roughly 97.5% of the input fully processed. 

In terms of fineness, the samples in Layer 1 and Layer 2 meet our requirements. Most of the bones and cartilage that went through the Excel’s grind chamber were broken down well enough to pass both colanders. Only a few big pieces showed up in the mass of remaining leftovers.

Design: Heavy with Premium Features
-----------------------------------

design Scores: **9.6**

*   Grind Chamber (30%) - **9.5**/10
    
*   Motor (30%) - **9.0**/10
    
*   Build Quality (40%) - **10**/10
    

The InSinkErator Evolution Excel has been the most expensive garbage disposal for years. But that’s not too surprising considering its premium features and InSinkErator’s quality control. 

The disposal offers everything from sturdy protective casing to robust internals. It also leads the market in noise control with an exclusive system. The weighty body certainly makes the installation process more difficult, but the Excel’s mounting mechanism helps a lot.

### In the Box

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/insinkerator-evolution-excel-box-cld2sxnoy00343p88a53h09st.jpg" alt="InSinkErator Evolution Excel 1 HP with 3-Bolt Mount assembly on top, next to its box, user manual, registration slip, sink stopper, hose clamp, elbow tube, straight tube, wrench, and bolts." width="300px" height="200px">

*   InSinkErator Evolution Excel Garbage Disposal
*   3-Bolt Mount assembly 
*   Removable splash guard
*   Stopper
*   Elbow discharge tube 
*   Straight discharge tube 
*   Hose clamp
*   Extra mounting bolts (x3)
*   Documentation

With the Evolution Excel, you get a few more accessories than you see from most garbage disposals on the market. You’ll still find the regular content, including a mounting set and a discharge/outlet set. But instead of a rubber gasket and a flange and bolts kit that secures the pipe(s) to the disposal, you’ll receive a hose clamp.

You’ll also get a few extra pieces that are useful for different settings under the sink. Relevant documentation includes a registration slip and a user manual; both are available in English, French, and Spanish. The text on the box is only in English and Spanish.

### Dimensions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/insinkerator-evolution-excel-1-hp-garbage-disposal-dimensions-clg4s5wki002n1p88hlfw64sb.jpg" alt="InSinkErator Evolution Excel 1-hp food disposer with mount assembly and elbow tube. Dimensions show 8.9-inch width, 12.9-inch height, 3.4-inch depth to dishwasher outlet, 7.1-inch depth to outlet, 6.1-inch distance to elbow tube." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 6.1" (15.5 cm)

Width: 8.9" (22.6 cm)

Height: 12.9" (32.8 cm)

Weight: 19.4 lbs (8.8 kg)

The Excel is a sizable machine. While it doesn’t take up that much space vertically, the disposer is quite bulky across. It is also the heaviest one that we’ve tested, and likely the heaviest on the current market as well. Before you put your money down, make sure that there’s plenty of room under the sink, and that the sink itself is strong and secure enough to support it.

### 9.5 - Grind Chamber

Capacity: 37.0 fl oz (1.1 L)

Verticality: 5.9" (15.0 cm)

Flywheel: 5.3" (13.3 cm)

Assembly Material: Stainless steel

Layout: Advanced

The InSinkErator Evolution Excel has one of the largest grinding chambers on the market. The ample holding capacity is perfect to deal with large amounts of food scraps of various sizes. That said, particularly long pieces of tough scraps, like uncooked chicken thigh bones, should be chopped down so they fit entirely under the sink baffle.

The disposal sports an intricate stainless-steel assembly with a unique design. The impellers are upgraded to be stronger and more rigid compared to lower-tier models of similar designs. The grater ring has higher cutter counts and more teeth for better grip as well. 

The flywheel also enjoys added fins and pushers on its surface meant to improve collision and breakage of scraps. It also has the InSinkErator exclusive Undercutter Disk. This extra layer of cutting teeth helps grind everything one extra time for finer output.

### 9.0 - Motor

Horsepower: 1

Speed: 1725 RPM

Real Speed: 1483 RPM

Voltage: 120 V

Current: 10.2 A

Wattage: 1224 W

Heat: N/A

Reverse: Yes

At its core, the Excel houses a high-torque 1-horsepower induction motor. The motor’s advertised speed is 1725 revolutions per minute (RPM). But by using a rev-counter, we found out that the motor moves the flywheel at only 1483 RPM (when the disposal is grinding nothing). Compared to weaker InSinkErator disposers, the Excel isn’t any faster. 

This is because most of the motor’s power is utilized for torque, instead. The improved torque, paired with the Auto Unjam drive, balances out the risk of jamming from the motor’s low rotation rates. If and when the machine jams, the Unjam drive will kick in, automatically reversing the spin as well as upping the torque of the motor to break through any blockage.

### 10 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/insinkerator-evolution-excel-build-quality-cld2szg02003b3p885yxl6dv7.jpg" alt="InSinkErator Evolution Excel 1 HP Continuous Feed Garbage Disposal, with 3-Bolt Mount assembly on top and outlet/discharge set installed." width="300px" height="200px">

Noise Reduction: Yes

Vibration Reduction: Yes

As far as build quality is concerned, the Evolution Excel doesn’t fall short anywhere. When holding the disposer, everything feels premium, secure, and well-crafted. 

The protective casing is tough and sleek-looking, securely fitted with shiny metal details that blend in well with the plastic. Both the collar and discharge outlet seal tightly and remain so even through our constant handling during testing. 

The disposal also sports the most advanced vibration and noise cancelation features that we’ve seen, collectively called SoundSeal. The tech utilizes shock-absorbing materials to cushion the disposer’s connection (to the sink and the pipes) and surround the grinding chamber with details that limit noise.

### Mount Assembly

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/insinkerator-evolution-excel-mount-assembly-cld2szm9z003c3p885jw2aro4.jpg" alt="InSinkErator Evolution Excel Mount Assembly" width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/insinkerator-evolution-excel-mount-assembly-1-cld2szsys003e3p88a8pr4fbd.jpg" alt="InSinkErator Evolution Excel Mount Assembly 1" width="300px" height="200px">

*   Backup flange
*   Mounting ring
*   Snap ring
*   Fiber gasket
*   Stopper
*   Cushion mount
*   Sink flange
*   Removable sink baffle
*   Lower mounting ring

The InSinkErator Excel is compatible with 3-Bolt Mount assemblies and it has what’s called Lift & Latch. This is basically a groove joint that lets the lower mounting ring lock onto the machine’s collar. 

During installation, you can hang the disposal onto the mount assembly by simply turning the body; you won’t have to touch the lower mounting ring and you can use both hands to support the machine. Then, secure the connection with tools.

The Evolution models (including the [Evolution Compact](https://healthykitchen101.com/garbage-disposals/reviews/insinkerator/insinkerator-evolution-compact-3-4-hp/) and [Evolution Essential XTR](https://healthykitchen101.com/garbage-disposals/reviews/insinkerator/insinkerator-evolution-essential-xtr-3-4-hp/)) come with removable sink baffles/splash guards. These particular baffles, called Quiet Collars, are made of a more flexible variation of rubber that is good for vibration absorption but makes them much easier to bend out of shape.

All other splash guards that we’ve tested so far are stiffer, allowing for an easier and snugger fit in the sink drain; the Quiet Collar baffles don’t always sit as comfortably.

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/insinkerator-evolution-excel-power-cord-cld2szzm0003f3p88cn5d6ubn.jpg" alt="Bottom view of InSinkErator Evolution Excel 1-hp with two pre-cut electrical wires and no power cord. (Unscrewed) cover plate and screw to the sides." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: NaN" (NaN cm)

Type: None

The standard version of the InSinkErator Evolution Excel doesn’t come with a power cord.

### Accessories: Discharge Set

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/insinkerator-evolution-excel-accessories-discharge-set-cld2t0ty9003g3p88fwfs8maa.jpg" alt="Hose clamp and elbow discharge/outlet tube for garbage disposals displayed on granite-looking top." width="300px" height="200px">

Width: 3.3" (8.3 cm)

Length: 5.3" (13.3 cm)

Material: PVC

The package includes a 1.5-inch elbow tube and a hose clamp for the discharge setup. Most standard garbage disposals use a flange, a gasket, and bolts to secure it all together. By contrast, the Evolution Excel uses a clamp as part of the InSinkErator exclusive Anti-Vibration Tailpipe Mount.

### Accessories: Straight Discharge Tube

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/insinkerator-evolution-excel-accessories-straight-discharge-tube-cld2t11p0003h3p886gkm7hgi.jpg" alt="Straight discharge/outlet tube for garbage disposals, displayed on granite-looking top." width="300px" height="200px">

Width: NaN" (NaN cm)

Length: 11.9" (30.2 cm)

Material: PVC

The package includes a long, straight discharge tube in case the elbow one doesn’t work with your sink. It’s also 1.5 inches in diameter.

### Accessories: Wrenchette

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/insinkerator-evolution-excel-accessories-wrenchette-cld2t1adz003j3p883xja1fuk.jpg" alt="Wrenchette/Jam-buster wrench for garbage disposals by InSinkErator, displayed on granite-looking top." width="300px" height="200px">

Width: NaN" (NaN cm)

Length: 5.0" (12.7 cm)

Material: Metal

Every InSinkErator garbage disposal comes with a jam buster wrench, also called a wrenchette, for installation as well as unjamming purposes.

### Accessories: Extra Mounting Bolts

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/insinkerator-evolution-excel-extra-mounting-bolts-cld2t1py2003k3p88cun9av4p.jpg" alt="Three 1.1-inch bolts for 3-Bolt Mount assemblies displayed on granite-looking top." width="300px" height="200px">

Width: NaN" (NaN cm)

Length: 1.1" (2.8 cm)

Material: Metal

The three extra bolts are shorter than the standard mounting bolts. They’re intended for sinks with bottom walls thicker than 3/8 inches (fireclay or porcelain sinks, for example).

Usability: Top of the Line
--------------------------

usability Scores: **8.5**

*   Installation (30%) - **5.0**/10
    
*   Ease of Use (40%) - **10**/10
    
*   Smooth Operation (25%) - **10**/10
    
*   Unjam Mechanics (5%) - **10**/10
    

Throughout our experience with the Evolution Excel, usability has never been a problem. With its strong motor, capable grind chamber, and impressive build quality, the garbage disposal has dealt handily with anything thrown its way. The only thing that might set the Excel back is its weight and space-consuming stature.

### 10 - Ease of Use

The disposer’s spacious, 1.1-liter chamber allows us to continuously flush scraps down without much of a hitch. Unless they’re particularly stubborn, all scraps get crushed in a matter of seconds. 

The sink baffle can be removed in case you need a wider drain opening. Also, reposition the baffle further up the sink flange if you need space for tall scraps. It’s not a perfect solution, though; the bones from our Raw Chicken Scraps test were still too long.

### 5.0 - Installation

The Evolution Excel is a hefty machine. At 19.4 pounds, most people will probably need two hands to hold it in place. That makes installation a two-person affair. 

It doesn't have a pre-installed power cord, either. So, if you’re not particularly handy, we recommend you find experienced help, especially with the wiring.

### 10 - Smooth Operation

Except for the installation, our time with the Evolution Excel has been one smooth ride from start to finish. The garbage disposal doesn’t shy away from any type of food waste and is quite content with any amount we throw at it. All test runs are quick and the output is outstanding. 

The anti-noise and anti-vibration system has been a wonder, too, even when dealing with hard-to-break materials. In comparison with other brands, the InSinkErator Evolution series — and the Excel in particular — really goes the extra mile with its insulation.

### 10 - Unjam Mechanics

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/excel-1hp-unjam-mechanics-cld2t3sz6003l3p88cbtn816w.jpg" alt="Bottom view of InSinkErator Excel disposal, showing jam buster wrench in manual unjam slot." width="300px" height="200px">

External: Yes

Auto Unjam: Yes

In the event of jamming and/or overheating, the disposer allows users to manually unjam the chamber’s flywheel from the outside. Use the provided wrenchette or an Allen wrench to access the unjam slot on the bottom of the machine.
