The InSinkErator Badger 1HP is a straightforward 1-hp garbage disposal with very few features, providing standard performance with slightly more power than the other smaller Badger models and solid construction quality. Performance-wise, the 1HP in particular, and the Badger series in general, may struggle with grinding thick citrus peels, leading to subpar results.

With the market being how it is right now, $200 can get you potentially [more valued options](https://healthykitchen101.com/garbage-disposals/reviews/best/).

**Things We Like**

*   High capacity
*   Stainless steel grinding components
*   External unjam mechanics

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Mediocre performance
*   Heavy build
*   Non-removable splash guard
*   Loud operation

At first glance, the InSinkErator Badger 1HP didn’t look the part as a Badger model. It had a bulkier upper body (compared to a similarly sized model, the [Badger 5XP 3/4-hp disposer](https://healthykitchen101.com/garbage-disposals/reviews/insinkerator/insinkerator-badger-5xp-3-4-hp/)) with an extra protective piece that hugs the top half of the machine. 

This particular piece could be for physical protection and heat insulation but not for sound treatment because the piece was fitted loosely. We thought that it was a faulty detail, but a closer look suggested otherwise. Other than that, the disposal appeared and felt well-built. It has the signature weight of an InSinkErator garbage disposal, which comes from metal body parts.

Performance

performance Scores: **4.2**

*   Scrap Mix (50%) - **5.0**/10

*   Raw Chicken Scraps (25%) - **6.8**/10
    

In spite of the indication that the Badger 1HP surpassed the smaller Badger 5XP, the actual variation, particularly in key areas, is not remarkable. The 5XP indeed performed better in crushing tough substances such as raw bones, where complete power is required. When considering the overall performance, however, the disposal is very much unsatisfactory.

### Scrap Mix

The InSinkErator Badger 1HP, equipped with a 1-hp motor, faced difficulty while grinding 90 ounces of miscellaneous food waste. It took considerable time to reduce the materials to safe levels. Despite managing to grind more than 99% of the input, the sizable piece of lemon peel left over was not reassuring. 

Upon comparing the records from all the runs starring the Badger 1HP, the Badger 5XP, and the [Badger 5](https://healthykitchen101.com/garbage-disposals/reviews/insinkerator/insinkerator-badger-5/), there was no noticeable improvement in quality. While the bigger motors dealt with bones more effectively, all three disposals struggled with the same type of food scraps.

### Raw Fish Scraps

The Badger 1HP failed at processing raw fish scraps as it was unable to reduce the amounts of input materials in the chamber to an acceptable level after 3 minutes. These results were unsurprising given its poor performance in the Scrap Mix test.

### Raw Chicken Scraps

When its turn came to process raw chicken bones, the Badger 1HP generated more engaging information. The disposal was able to crush all the bony fragments that were fed into it, but the stringy and spongy tissues gave it a hard time. 

This suggested that the disposal's performance was limited to separating the soft tissues from the bones; pulverizing those soft tissues would have required a more intricately designed grinding assembly or a much faster motor.

Design
------

design Scores: **8.1**

*   Grind Chamber (30%) - **7.0**/10
    
*   Motor (30%) - **8.5**/10
    
*   Build Quality (40%) - **8.5**/10
    

The Badger 1HP can be considered a more powerful version of the Badger 5XP. It utilizes the same sturdy materials and construction as the Badger 5XP but operates on a larger AC motor. However, the added strength doesn't seem to improve the disposal’s grinding performance, which is disappointing. 

That’s why we view the InSinkErator Badger 1HP as a substitute rather than an upgrade. It does have that piece of casing that provides some extra extent of protection.

The Badger 1HP 1-hp garbage disposal is packaged in a presentable box without any glossy finish. Despite being less sturdy without the coating, it makes composting easier. Moreover, all written information about the product such as the manual and registration slip are available in English and Spanish.

### Dimensions

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/insinkerator-badger-1hp-garbage-disposal-dimensions-clgyjhkc0000bzp885fpr4pco.jpg" alt="Badger 1HP with mount assembly and elbow tube.

Length: 4.8" (12.2 cm)

Width: 7.3" (18.5 cm)

Height: 12.6" (32.0 cm)

Weight: 15.2 lbs (6.9 kg)

The Badger 1HP takes up very little room underneath the sink. It’s a little bigger than the Badger 5 and has the exact vertical length as the 5XP. To envision its build, imagine adding approximately one inch to the Badger 5's body and 3 pounds to its total weight.

### Mount Assembly

The strong structure of the 3-bolt mounting mechanisms works excellently to hold up heavy units. Because of this, it is commonly found in large models, such as the Badger 1HP. Handling the 3-bolt system can be straightforward or difficult, depending on your level of skills. Although it does not demand expertise, if this is your first project, it may take some time to complete it accurately.

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/insinkerator-badger-1hp-garbage-disposal-power-cord-clgyjp8fw000ezp882dxmhnqo.jpg" alt="Bottom view of InSinkErator Badger 1HP garbage disposal without power cord." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: NaN" (NaN cm)

Type: N/a

The Badger 1HP doesn't include a built-in power cable, making it better suited for direct wiring. There are no versions with a factory-installed cord, so you’ll have to buy [a separate kit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BQWXG2?&linkCode=ll1&tag=lunaggd20-20&linkId=5b245cbd3080f45e1f071c8d0b763475&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl).

### Accessories: Discharge Set

Each InSinkErator waste disposal unit includes a tool known as the Jam-Buster wrench or wrenchette. This tool serves two functions: It can be used to install the unit, and it allows you to access the mechanics that unjam the device.

### 7.0 - Grind Chamber

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/insinkerator-badger-1hp-garbage-disposal-grind-chamber-clgyjs4ne000hzp8822x535mf.jpg" alt="Top view of grinding components in InSinkErator Badger 1HP looking at layout of flywheel and impellers." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/insinkerator-badger-1hp-garbage-disposal-grind-chamber-1-clgyjslol000izp882hxccfhe.jpg" alt="Precutter/grater ring in InSinkErator Badger 1HP showing layout of cutters and grinding teeth." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/insinkerator-badger-1hp-garbage-disposal-grind-chamber-2-clgyjt34z000jzp88eablegva.jpg" alt="Grinding components in InSinkErator Badger 1HP showing design of flywheel and impeller(s)." width="300px" height="200px">

Capacity: 32 fl.oz.

Verticality: 4.5" (11.4 cm)

Flywheel: 5.3" (13.3 cm)

Assembly Material: Stainless steel

Layout: Basic

The Badger 1HP, the Badger 5XP, and the Badger 5 all have identical chambers, including the capacity rating and grinding parts. All three models feature spacious holding chambers, but the 1HP utilizes stainless steel instead, which stays sharp longer than galvanized steel. However, like the other Badger models, the 1HP's chamber is too narrow due to the use of a fixed drain baffle piece.

### 8.5 - Motor

Horsepower: 1

Speed: 1725 RPM

Current: 10.2 A

Wattage: 1200 W

Heat: N/a

Reverse: No

InSinkErator's induction motors are designed to operate at slow speeds, which can be a problem if food scraps are too tough. Fortunately, the 1HP’s extra torque minimizes the risk of jamming as it's more powerful than other models in the series.

However, it's worth noting that induction motors tend to run hot, and they're more prone to short-circuit than permanent magnet motors. This means, if your family cooks frequently, you should be cautious when using the disposer for extended periods or with heavy loads.

### 8.5 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/insinkerator-badger-1hp-garbage-disposal-build-quality-clgyjuez9000kzp88asrq19hv.jpg" alt="InSinkErator Badger 1HP Garbage Disposal, with 3-Bolt Mount assembly on top and outlet/discharge set in place." width="300px" height="200px">

Noise Reduction: Yes

Vibration Reduction: No

InSinkErator garbage disposals are known for their excellent build quality. For instance, the Badger 1HP model is mainly made of metal and can endure up to ten years of daily use with proper care. The disposal’s biggest drawback is that it gets really loud when grinding hard foods which may cause serious discomfort.

Usability

usability Scores: **7.4**

*   Installation (30%) - **6.5**/10
    
*   Ease of Use (40%) - **8.0**/10

The InSinkErator Power Badger series is meant to amplify the power of the weaker Standard Badger models. Along with their capacity to hold more waste, the Badger series are famous for their long-lasting durability. 

While we were testing the InSinkErator Badger 1HP, things weren’t as easy as we had expected. But it should be noted that our experience could have been better if we hadn't included raw animal bones in the test, as they proved to be the most challenging item for the disposal.

### 8.0 - Ease of Use

After testing a number of InSinkErator garbage disposals, we noticed that the induction motor's low rotational speed works best with the Evolution Series' exclusive MultiGrind design. This combination results in better overall output quality and more effective handling of bones.

The disposal still has a spacious holding chamber, just like the others in the series. If your family consists of three members, and your household kitchen waste mostly comprises of produce, then the 1HP garbage disposal can help out.

### 6.5 - Installation

The Badger 1HP setup can be challenging due to its weight and intricate mounting components. If you can handle them, the only other concern would be the plumbing. The product is compact for its power rating and won't take up much space in your cabinets.

### 8.0 - Smooth Operation

The Badger 1HP didn't perform well during the evaluation of its performance. The disposal system struggled with tough materials such as fruit pits and bones, which not only challenged the strength of its construction but also its grinder chamber. Even pulverizing lemons and other citrus fruits proved to be a trying task for the grinder if they weren't cut up well prior to disposal.

### 5.0 - Unjam Mechanics

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/insinkerator-badger-1hp-garbage-disposal-unjam-mechanics-clgyjvhrq000lzp88b7kyeucc.jpg" alt="Bottom view of InSinkErator Badger garbage disposal showing jam-buster wrench in manual unjam slot." width="300px" height="200px">

External: Yes

Auto Unjam: No

You can use the included jam-buster wrench, or any Allen wrench with the appropriate size, to turn the flywheel (in the chamber) via a socket on the bottom of the disposal.
