The Moen GX50C Prep Series 1/2 HP Garbage Disposal is an affordable but quality product. It offers a long-lasting build with quality materials and a high-speed motor that lowers the risk of jamming. It has a neat and modern look and offers great craftsmanship.

Considering its configurations and price, the disposal is a well-balanced product. For a household with less than people who don’t hold a lot of parties, the GX50C should be able to provide considerable value.

In the small garbage disposals category, the Moen GX50C 1/2 HP is easily one of the best-looking units—not so much in a “sleek and shiny” kind of way, but more in a “well-made and functional” way. The disposal enjoys a clever design that manages to save space and provide noise control at the same time.

The GX50C is very popular across online retailers, which is not a surprise considering what it offers. While it didn’t see particularly great results in performance evaluation, its affordability and quality build are nice recompense.

### Scrap Mix

The Moen GX50C 1/2-hp garbage disposal scored under average for this test. The disposal did a great job chewing everything from the input down to just a few shredded pieces of random scraps. With less than 0.1 ounces of materials remaining in the chamber, the disposal delivered an efficiency rate of more than 99%. 

However, it couldn’t deliver adequate results as plenty of materials from the output were caught by the filters. A lot of fish bone can be seen from the result piles; though interestingly, the chicken bones were all completely crushed.

### Raw Fish Scraps

The GX50C 1/2 HP struggled to process the input of this test. After the run finished, there were plenty of materials left behind, much of which were fish skin and a few blocks of vertebrae. To be honest, we had expected more pieces of backbones, but the grinder surprised us.

Though the overall results from this test were unremarkable, it’s reasonable. Small garbage disposals are simply not meant for challenging tasks such as this one.

### Raw Chicken Scraps

Layer 2: 1.6 oz (44 g)

Leftovers: 0.6 oz (17 g)

The disposal was considerably competent at grinding down the brittle chicken bones. In 3 minutes, it was able to bring the input down to only 0.6 ounces of materials. A lot of the leftovers are shredded pieces of cartilage and no distinguishable boney parts.

These results again highlight how effective the GX50C could be when processing scraps of the sort, but also its incompetence with slippery and spongy materials.

Design

The Moen GX Series in general, and the GX50C in specific, is well-made. The disposal uses strong and quality materials for its construction, from the body casing to the grinder components. From the very beginning, we can somewhat tell that the Moen GX50C is solid; getting a hold of and testing it only reinforced our impressions.

The disposal is compatible with 3-bolt mounting sets and has a power cord. It also employs an efficient motor and acoustic treatment for the noise, though the effects are dismissible.

### In the Box

*   3-Bolt mount assembly
*   Removable splash guard
*   Stopper
*   Discharge tube and rubber gasket
*   Flange and bolts 
*   Documentation
*   (Pre-installed) power cord

Alongside the disposal, the box includes a few extra pieces, mainly for the outlet setup. All texts in the user manual and on the box are in English, Spanish, and French.

### Dimensions

Dimensions show 7.3-inch width, 13.3-inch height, 3.4-inch depth to dishwasher outlet, 6.9-inch depth to outlet, 5.4-inch distance to elbow tube." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 5.4" (13.7 cm)

Width: 7.3" (18.5 cm)

Height: 13.4" (34.0 cm)

Weight: 9.9 lbs (4.5 kg)

The clever design of the Moen GX50C lets it save some space under the sink while still providing an extent of soundproofing. That said, the disposal is not going to fit all cabinet sizes, especially those with small sinks.

In terms of weight, it’s not heavy but not the most lightweight model, either. Compared to the GE Disposall Green—our pick for Best Small [Food Waste Disposal](https://healthykitchen101.com/garbage-disposals/reviews/best/), this Moen is roughly 1 pound heavier.

### Mount Assembly

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/moen-1-2-hp-garbage-disposal-mount-assembly-clg1q3c99001p1p88exp990im.jpg" alt="3-Bolt Mount assembly for garbage disposals placed on white platform. “Moen” engraving on rim of sink flange.

*   Sink flange
*   Cushion mount
*   Fiber gasket
*   Removable splash guard
*   Lower mount ring
*   Mount ring
*   Backup flange
*   Snap ring

If you’re switching out another 3-bolt garbage disposal, the Moen GX50C should hook right on. If this is your first 3-bolt set, it can be a little daunting, disassembling the assembly, especially the mechanic of the snap ring. Due to its rather complex nature, spending some time getting used to the design and consulting the instructions in the manual should help.

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/moen-1-2-hp-garbage-disposal-power-cord-clg1q5zky001r1p88fqe73u34.jpg" alt="Type B power cord of Moen GX50C GX Series Prep 1/2 HP Garbage Disposal." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 34.0" (86.4 cm)

Type: 3-prong (B)

The disposal comes with a pre-installed cord, which is helpful if you have power sockets in the sink cabinet. If you want to hardwire the unit to the mainline, you must manually remove the power cord.

### Accessories: Discharge Set

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/moen-1-2-hp-garbage-disposal-accessories-clg1q6umx001s1p88ciui60ir.jpg" alt="Standard outlet/discharge set for garbage disposals on granite-looking top, showing elbow pipe, rubber gasket, flange, bolts." width="300px" height="200px">

Width: 3.3" (8.3 cm)

Length: 5.3" (13.3 cm)

Material: PVC

A standard 1.5-inch elbow pipe, a rubber gasket, and a kit of flange and bolts complete the discharge set of the Moen GX50C. The bolts have Phillip drives and hex heads.

### 7.5 - Grind Chamber

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/moen-1-2-hp-garbage-disposal-grind-chamber-1-clg1qaexm001u1p88grev74sf.jpg" alt="Grind chamber of Moen GX50C garbage disposal, showing two-level grinder ring and details on flywheel." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/moen-1-2-hp-garbage-disposal-grind-chamber-2-clg1qaxwr001v1p889mnadkb4.jpg" alt="Grind chamber of Moen GX50C garbage disposal, showing impellers and details of flywheel and grinder ring." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/moen-1-2-hp-garbage-disposal-grind-chamber-2-clg1qaxwr001v1p889mnadkb4.jpg" alt="Grind chamber of Moen GX50C garbage disposal, showing impellers and details of flywheel and grinder ring." width="300px" height="200px">

Capacity: 30.0 fl oz (887.2 ml)

Verticality: 6.3" (16.0 cm)

Flywheel: 4.4" (11.2 cm)

Assembly Material: Stainless steel

Layout: Basic

Moen gears the chamber of the GX50C with a typical grinding assembly found in other permanent-magnet garbage disposals as well. It has a simple chamber layout with stainless steel grinder parts that last and stay sharp longer than galvanized ones. 

For a 1/2-hp garbage disposal, the chamber is generous in terms of capacity. In the small size category, the largest chamber capacity is 32 fluid ounces and the most restricted is 23 fluid ounces.

### 8.5 - Motor

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/moen-1-2-hp-garbage-disposal-motor-cloy08f5f000jfi88adav1r6t.jpg" alt="A digital tachometer is measuring the speed of the motor/flywheel of the Moen 1/2-HP garbage disposal in our speed test. A smartphone is running the timer app." width="300px" height="200px">

Horsepower: 1/2

Speed: 2600 RPM

Real Speed: 4207 RPM

Voltage: 115 V (60 Hz)

Current: 3.2 A

Wattage: 368 W

Heat: N/a

Reverse: No

A 1/2-horsepower permanent magnet motor can easily outperform an induction motor of the same power rating. Take the Moen GX50C for example, the average rotational speed of its motor is 4214 revolutions per minute (RPM), which is way faster than the averaged 1478 RPM of the [Badger 5](https://healthykitchen101.com/garbage-disposals/reviews/insinkerator/insinkerator-badger-5/). And when the grinder assembly spins fast, it avoids jamming much better.

Permanent magnet motors don’t run hot so they are much less prone to overheating than induction motors. During our testing phase, we noted that the induction-motor models overheated a total of five times whereas the permanent-magnet models didn’t at all.

### 9.5 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/moen-1-2-hp-garbage-disposal-build-quality-clg1qc14x001w1p883nvo0mtc.jpg" alt="Moen GX50C garbage disposal with 3-Bolt Mount assembly on top and outlet/discharge set installed." width="300px" height="200px">

Noise Reduction: Yes

Vibration Reduction: No

The Moen GX50C is a well-made product with good craftsmanship; everything simply feels right and secure from top to bottom. Its body casing is made of quality plastic with a reinforcing structure underneath. Under that, a layer of acoustic foam wraps around the grinder’s core to treat loud noises. 

In the small kitchen food waste disposer category on the market, the Moen GX50C probably has the best build quality—it already does when compared to the other seven 1/2-hp garbage disposals we’ve tested.

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **NaN**

*   Installation (30%) - **8.5**/undefined

*   Unjam Mechanics (5%) - **0**/undefined
    

If it wasn’t for its rather disappointing performance, the Moen GX50C 1/2 hp would have everything to be the best garbage disposal. It can be a little heavy for its power rating but that’s a fair tradeoff for durability. Thanks to the clever design, the disposal is able to balance between size and utility.

Of course, being a compact model, the disposal has its share of inconveniences, like its poor ability to stabilize when processing tough ingredients.

### 9.0 - Ease of Use

As long as there aren’t any food scraps that are too tough, like fish bones or raw chicken scraps, the GX50C should be fine. All discards from vegetables and fruits, even avocado pits, should not trouble the disposal at all. Its roomy chamber is comfortable to accommodate long pieces of stems or stalks and the sink baffle can be removed for larger scraps.

### 8.5 - Installation

The part that usually gives people the most problems is the 3-mounting assembly. Other than that, its weight can be a challenge if you don’t have the strength. The disposal comes corded which is perfect for cabinets with power sockets built in. If you’re planning to hardwire but not particularly handy yourself, we recommend getting professional help.

_(tips: \*For safety reasons, you should ALWAYS set up to control your garbage disposal via a dedicated switch with a clear “Off” position.)_

### 8.0 - Smooth Operation

Despite its noise reduction features, the GX50C Prep 1/2 HP is loud. It’s technically quieter than disposals with no noise treatment, but it’s difficult to tell the difference. 

The disposal is also not suitable to deal with animal bones either cooked or raw. It might get lucky with the crunchy bone tissues of chicken, but if the bones are thick and not thoroughly cooked, we wouldn’t put our bet on this Moen.

### Failed - Unjam Mechanics

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/moen-1-2-hp-garbage-disposal-external-unjam-mechanics-clg1qcuyu001x1p8878e91mfk.jpg" alt="Inside view of permanent-magnet garbage disposal showing manual unjam mechanics with wooden stick in flywheel’s opening/gap." width="300px" height="200px">

External: No

Auto Unjam: No

If jamming happens, which is rare, we can use a stick to rotate the flywheel through the sink drain to free the chamber.
