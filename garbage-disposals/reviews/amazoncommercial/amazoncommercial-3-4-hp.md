The AmazonCommercial B07XFDMPNJ 3/4 Horsepower is a capable yet affordable garbage disposal. Although it’s not particularly effective against raw meat scraps, it can take care of common food waste (vegetables, fruits, etc.) without struggle.

The disposal looks generic, but you may be impressed after seeing it at work. Amazon takes features that work well on other popular models and incorporates them into its own products. After all, you can’t go wrong with an efficient motor and a grinding assembly made of strong materials.

**Things We Like**

*   Noise cancelation
*   High speed 
*   Stainless steel grind components
*   Lightweight
*   Affordable

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Can be loud

The AmazonCommercial series looks no different than other generic garbage disposals. In particular, the B07XFDMPNJ, which is the 3/4-horsepower model of the series, appears to follow the design of the [Waste King L-3200](https://healthykitchen101.com/garbage-disposals/reviews/waste-king/waste-king-l-3200/). They are almost identical, from the size and shape of the casing to the motor. However, that’s not necessarily a bad thing.

The 3/4-hp AmazonCommercial B07XFDMPNJ is one of the [best food disposals](https://healthykitchen101.com/garbage-disposals/reviews/best/) that we’ve tested. It did well across all categories and notably excelled in dealing with large amounts of assorted kitchen scraps—and there were more than ten types of food.

The disposal is also effective in the raw animal scrap tests, even outperforming several 1-horsepower models. It was quick to swallow everything and the output is acceptable. Still, we’re not sure if the disposal is efficient enough for such tough materials.

### Scrap Mix

The AmazonCommercial B07XFDMPNJ garbage disposal very quickly tore through our prepared 90 ounces of food scraps. In a bit more than 2 minutes, this mishmash of various foods including celery, avocado pits, and cooked bones was done. The disposal left no more than 0.3% of the input in its chamber.

Most of the output was well-processed and went straight through Layer 2. However, some of the thin, bendy fish bones managed to slip through the chamber. Other materials that gathered in the two colanders—even the chicken bones—were effectively pulverized.

### Raw Fish Scraps

The AmazonCommercial B07XFDMPNJ was surprisingly effective against raw fish scraps. In 3 minutes, it was able to grind down more than 95% of our two sets of salmon parts. What remained was 2.24 ounces of shredded skin along with pieces of broken-up backbone. Most of the output came out well processed. A total of only 13% of the ground material gathered in the two colanders. 

The disposal didn’t have a bad run, but it wasn’t ideal, either. Our tests have shown that raw fish scraps are very resilient, so budget garbage disposals rarely handle them well. Interestingly, this 3/4-hp disposal from Amazon did better than the Waste King L-3300.

### Raw Chicken Scraps

The B07XFDMPNJ worked about as well on raw chicken scraps as it did on fish. The disposal was fast; it took roughly 1 minute and 45 seconds to finish the essential parts of the task. Although the disposal could have passed the test at that point, we gave it another 15 seconds, for better or worse. This was partly to round up the time and to see whether the disposal could process any more of the leftovers. Unfortunately, not much changed during the extra time.

Most of the output went straight through Layer 1. The materials that got caught in the two colanders were mostly stringy, fibrous tissues and a select few bone bits. This means that the majority of the bones were pulverized into drain-safe morsels.

Design: Simplicity is Usually Best

The B07XFDMPNJ 3/4-hp garbage disposal doesn’t innovate; affordable products seldom do. In fact, the whole AmazoncomCommercial series seems like another copycat of the successful Waste King Legend series, only with a more colorful appearance. 

However, capitalizing on things that already work is anything but foolish. When you put together a fast motor, a durable grind chamber, and quality craftsmanship, you can hardly lose.

### In the Box

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/amazoncommercial-b07xfdmpnj-3-4-hp-box-cld2thgxf004g3p884n0t295x.jpg" alt="Corded AmazonCommercial 3/4 HP, EZ Mount on top, its box, user manual, stopper, elbow tube, rubber gasket, flange, and bolts." width="300px" height="200px">

The Amazon B07XFDMPNJ comes in a bland cardboard box. However, the available info, including the disposal’s model number and serial number, was enough for us to do a quick internet search for other specifications. In the box, you’ll find the standard accessories: a mounting assembly, a discharge set, and a user manual. All the text on the box and in the manual is in English, French, and Spanish.

### Dimensions

Height: 13.9" (35.3 cm)

For a 3/4-hp food waste disposer, the machine is neither small nor large. It should fit comfortably below any double-bowl sink as well as most medium-sized single-bowl sinks. It’s not very heavy, either; in fact, it is one of the lightest 3/4-horsepower models that we’ve tested.

### Mount Assembly

Amazon garbage disposals are compatible with EZ Mounts. The EZ system has a very simple design that requires no tools to assemble or disassemble. Its components are also lightweight, so it’s easy to handle. That said, the overall connection is less secure than the other industry standard, the 3-Bolt system. EZ Mount disposals like the B07XFDMPNJ may rotate on their own if the mounting connection is slippery, especially with strong motors.

### 8.5 - Grind Chamber

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/amazoncommercial-b07xfdmpnj-3-4-hp-grind-chamber-cld2tj8bb004m3p88hmzq8it7.jpg" alt="Top view into chamber of AmazonCommercial B07XFDMPNJ garbage disposal after testing, showing layout of grinding components." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/amazoncommercial-b07xfdmpnj-3-4-hp-grind-chamber-1-cld2tjf9x004n3p88gvuybpad.jpg" alt="Grind chamber of AmazonCommercial B07XFDMPNJ garbage disposal, showing two-level grinder ring and details on flywheel." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/amazoncommercial-b07xfdmpnj-3-4-hp-grind-chamber-2-cld2tjnab004o3p88e9ge0mgv.jpg" alt="Grind chamber of AmazonCommercial B07XFDMPNJ garbage disposal, showing impellers and details of flywheel and grinder rin" width="300px" height="200px">

Capacity: 30.0 fl oz (887.2 ml)

Verticality: 6.8" (17.3 cm)

Flywheel: 4.4" (11.2 cm)

Assembly Material: Intermediate

Layout: Stainless steel

The AmazonCommercial 3/4-hp disposal has a typical chamber for this style of food disposer. Ultimately, that’s a good thing. The high holding capacity is appropriate for large amounts of food scraps and the extended depth is great for dealing with long items (like chicken bones or celery stalks).

The disposal also has a stainless steel grinding assembly typically found in other permanent-magnet models of the same power range. The assembly has the same layout and the same set of components, from the impellers to the precutter/grater ring. These grater rings have two levels of cutters and larger teeth compared to 1/2-horsepower disposals, which have only one level of cutters.

### 9.5 - Motor

Horsepower: 3/4

Speed: 2700 RPM

Real Speed: 4940 RPM

Voltage: 115 V

Current: 6 A

Wattage: 690 W

Heat: n/a

Reverse: No

Like others in the series, the Amazon B07XFDMPNJ employs a permanent magnet motor. These motors are faster and produce less waste heat than induction motors. This helps prevent jamming and overheating incidents that may damage internal components. 

On paper, the Amazon 3/4 Horsepower grinds food at about 2700 revolutions per minute (RPM). In reality, when we used a laser rev-counter to examine the flywheel, it reached up to 4940 RPM when there were no scraps in the chamber. The exceptionally high speed explains how the disposal handled simple foods in large amounts without straining.

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/amazoncommercial-b07xfdmpnj-3-4-hp-power-cord-cld2tju92004p3p88gqy67wvs.jpg" alt="Bottom view of AmazonCommercial 3/4 HP corded garbage disposal with type-B power cord." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: 34.5" (87.6 cm)

Type: 3-prong (type B)

All garbage disposals in the AmazonCommercial series come with a pre-wired power cord.

### Accessories: Discharge Set

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/amazoncommercial-b07xfdmpnj-3-4-hp-accessories-discharge-set-cld2tk7k3004r3p885hc36nd7.jpg" alt="Standard outlet/discharge set for garbage disposals on granite-looking top, showing elbow pipe, rubber gasket, flange, bolts." width="300px" height="200px">

Width: 3.3" (8.3 cm)

Length: 5.3" (13.3 cm)

Material: PVC

AmazonCommercial disposals each come with a standard outlet set which includes an elbow pipe, a rubber gasket, and a kit composed of a flange and bolts. You can use either a flat-head screwdriver or a wrench to drive these bolts. The pipe is 1.5 inches in diameter and the bolts have 3/8-inch hex heads.

### 9.5 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/amazoncommercial-b07xfdmpnj-3-4-hp-build-quality-cld2tkfld004s3p88cibdbb54.jpg" alt="AmazonCommerical 3/4-HP Garbage Disposal with EZ Mount assembly on top and outlet/discharge set installed." width="300px" height="200px">

Noise Reduction: Yes

Vibration Reduction: No

For a Waste King look-alike product, this AmazonCommercial disposal is surprisingly well-built. It’s one of the only two units that remained tightly fitted after our testing process—and we’ve done six similar models. We checked this by shaking them one by one and seeing if the casing or any component felt loose.

The fetching orange plastic casing is strong and flexible. It can take a certain amount of impact, doesn’t scratch easily, and hides nicks very well. Case in point: Even after all our testing, the B07XFDMPNJ unit looks about the same as when it came out of the box. There is noise-dampening treatment under the casing, but it’s simply a layer of acoustic foam whose effectiveness is minimal.

Usability: Sufficient is the Word
---------------------------------

usability Scores: **NaN**

*   Installation (30%) - **9.0**/undefined
    
*   Ease of Use (40%) - **8.0**/undefined
    
*   Smooth Operation (25%) - **8.0**/undefined
    
*   Unjam Mechanics (5%) - **0**/undefined
    

The 3/4-hp garbage disposal from AmazonCommercial took us by surprise by the end of our tests. We had thought it was another copycat product; and on some levels, we were right. But its strong performance has turned us around. 

With good craftsmanship and quality parts, the disposal stands out and holds its own against more expensive models.

### 8.0 - Ease of Use

We found that the disposal’s grind chamber suffices nicely when the food is not too challenging, even if it comes in large volumes. Thanks to the chamber’s grinding capability and capacity, scraps go in continuously but don’t crowd the chamber. Compared to certain disposals with more spacious chambers, the Amazon B07XFDMPNJ doesn’t feel any tighter. 

All EZ Mount disposals have removable baffles, which helps speed up the process when there is much to grind. You can also reposition the baffle up the drain to make full use of the EZ Mount’s deep sink flange. One thing to note is that the sink flanges on EZ units are narrower than those of the 3-Bolt system; if you’re used to the 3-Bolt design, it might feel a little restricting at first.

### 9.0 - Installation

Getting the B07XFDMPNJ up and running is not difficult. It’s not just because of the EZ assembly but also because the disposal is very lightweight. It’s not overly bulky either, so most people won’t have trouble moving it around. As mentioned, the disposal has a power cord, so if your sink cabinet already has a power socket, you’re all set.

To our knowledge, Amazon currently doesn’t have a non-corded line of garbage disposals. If you’re planning on hardwiring your in-sink grinder, you’ll have to remove the cord from the B07XFDMPNJ.

### 8.0 - Smooth Operation

In general, this Amazon food waste disposer operates quickly and smoothly. However, like other disposers of this type, noise control is lacking; the disposal’s soundproofing has no apparent effect on crunchy food. Fortunately, that’s its biggest weakness. If you don’t mind some short-lived noise, there’s nothing else keeping you from considering the B07XFDMPNJ.

### Failed - Unjam Mechanics

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/amazoncommercial-b07xfdmpnj-3-4-hp-unjam-mechanics-cld2tm7p6004v3p88fqfe9yh3.jpg" alt="Inside view of permanent-magnet garbage disposal showing manual unjam mechanics with wooden stick in flywheel’s opening/gap." width="300px" height="200px">

External: No

Auto Unjam: No

Permanent-magnet food disposers generally don’t have external unjam features the way InSinkErator models do. If jamming happens (which is quite rare), you may use a stick or dowel to reach into the chamber and rotate the flywheel. Just remember to completely disconnect the power supply beforehand.
