The Emerson Evergrind E202 1/2 HP Garbage Disposal could be a reliable appliance if its strong metal construction and generous chamber capacity did not have to compensate for the ineffective motor. Its lack of verticality and the absence of a removable splash guard also limit its overall performance compared to more modern models.

Considering the product’s subpar performance results and current price, there is a range of [better options](https://healthykitchen101.com/garbage-disposals/reviews/best/) available.

**Things We Like**

*   High capacity
*   Compact design
*   External unjam mechanics

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Subpar performance
*   Heavy build
*   Non-removable splash guard
*   Loud operation

The Evergrind E202 and the [InSinkErator Badger 5](https://healthykitchen101.com/garbage-disposals/reviews/insinkerator/insinkerator-badger-5/) have similar designs, with the same body casing but different colors. They also have nearly identical specifications, from their grinding layout to their motors. The Emerson E202 appears to be robust and well-constructed, much like the Badger 5. As a result, despite its power rating, the E202 is relatively heavy.

The Evergrind E202 1/2-hp garbage disposal failed two out of three tests and barely passed the one with passable results. The disposal even overheated more than once during the process. It seemed to do okay with easy-to-grind foods (fruit slices, for example) in small amounts but tough fruit peels—like lemon peels—could easily give the disposal a hard time.

### Scrap Mix

During the course of the run, the Evergrind E202 overheated once mid-session. Because the disposal wasn’t efficient, we had to let it run for the whole 4 minutes in the hope that it still might bring the input materials down to a passable amount. Our efforts, however, were in vain. Judging by the leftovers, the lemon peels appeared to be the ones that brought the machine to a halt as the motor shut down due to overheating.

### Raw Fish Scraps

Unsurprisingly, the E202 failed to process raw fish remains too. Being the toughest test in our procedures, the test has even challenged low-tier high-power units. The disposal and its humble specs simply aren’t meant to deal with the likes of tricky fish skin and spongy bones.

### Raw Chicken Scraps

Somehow, the Evergrind managed to do much better with raw chicken bones. The brittle hollow bones and their natural crunchiness are prone to breakage and certainly no match for strong metal. Slippery and flexible materials remained challenging for the E202 in particular, and all mid to low-tier models in general.

Similar to the InSinkErator Badger 5, the Emerson E202 is strong with a full-metal construction. The heavy housing may be heavy, but it is built to last. The disposal has a large capacity for a 1/2-hp unit, yet is compact in cabinets under the sink.

### In the Box

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/evergrind-e202-1-2-hp-garbage-disposal-box-clhfwea6j000ouw887ka05pnf.jpg" alt="Emerson Evergrind E202 1/2 HP Garbage Disposal with 3-Bolt Mount, box, register slip, user manual, stopper, elbow tube, rubber gasket, flange, bolts, and wrench." width="300px" height="200px">

The Emerson Evergrind E202’s box includes the standard accessories commonly found with garbage disposals, and an exclusive self-service tool called the Jam-Buster wrench. The packaging contains a product registration slip and a user manual, both of which are in English, Spanish, and French.

### Dimensions

Length: 4.8" (12.2 cm)

Width: 6.3" (16.0 cm)

Height: 11.5" (29.2 cm)

Weight: 12.1 lbs (5.5 kg)

One of the Evergrind E202’s strengths is its compact build that should fit comfortably in most sink cabinets. Just make sure that the sink base is robust and secure before mounting the disposal because the disposal can be a bit heavy for certain setups.

### Mount Assembly

The Evergrind E202 is fit for 3-Bolt mounting sets. Most of the pieces in the 3-Bolt are composed of metal, so it's strong, yet its design is more complex in comparison to the EZ system. In any case, to separate and reassemble the 3-Bolt you will need a screwdriver at least, while for the EZ you only need your hands.

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/evergrind-e202-1-2-hp-garbage-disposal-power-cord-clhfwl9ib000suw883kbx00s1.jpg" alt="Bottom view of Emerson Evergrind E202 1/2 HP garbage disposal without power cord." width="300px" height="200px">

Length: NaN" (NaN cm)

Type: N/a

The standard version of the E202 doesn’t have a pre-installed power cord.

### Accessories: Discharge Set

Length: 5.3" (13.3 cm)

Material: PVC

The kit for the discharge outlet includes a 1.5-inch elbow tube with a rubber gasket, plus a set of flanges and bolts. The bolts have slotted hex heads that are 3/8 inches.

### Accessories: Wrenchette

Like other InSinkErator garbage disposals, the Evergrind E202 comes with a jam buster wrench, also called a wrenchette, for installation and unjamming purposes.

### 6.5 - Grind Chamber

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/evergrind-e202-1-2-hp-garbage-disposal-grind-chamber-clhfwokot000uuw88gct9gn68.jpg" alt="Top view of grinding components in Emerson Evergrind E202 looking at layout of flywheel and impellers." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/evergrind-e202-1-2-hp-garbage-disposal-grind-chamber-1-clhfwp27z000vuw88cpdtb0eu.jpg" alt="Precutter/grater ring in Emerson Evergrind E202 showing layout of cutters and grinding teeth." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/evergrind-e202-1-2-hp-garbage-disposal-grind-chamber-2-clhfwpohg000wuw88hp7q7l5p.jpg" alt="Grinding components in Emerson Evergrind E202 showing design of flywheel and impeller(s)." width="300px" height="200px">

Capacity: 32 fl.oz.

Verticality: 4.5" (11.4 cm)

Flywheel: 5.3" (13.3 cm)

Assembly Material: Basic

Layout: Galvanized steel

The Badger 5 offers a larger holding capacity (up to 32 fluid ounces) than many other small garbage disposals. Unfortunately, the unit is quite limited in vertical space due to its lack of a detachable sink baffle. The chamber only houses basic grinding components made mostly from galvanized steel, which is not as durable as stainless steel edges.

### 7.0 - Motor

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/evergrind-e202-1-2-hp-garbage-disposal-motor-cloxzp8rs000ffi88c935c7rk.jpg" alt="A digital tachometer is measuring the speed of the motor/flywheel of the Evergrind E202 1/2 HP Garbage Disposal in our speed test. A smartphone is running the timer app." width="300px" height="200px">

Horsepower: 1/2

Speed: 1725 RPM

Real Speed: 1474 RPM

Voltage: 120 V (60 Hz)

Current: 6.3 A

Wattage: 756 W

Heat: N/a

Reverse: No

The Evergrind E202 1/2 HP runs on an induction motor, which is said to reach 1725 revolutions per minute (RPM). However, when measured with a laser tachometer, it only managed to spin at 1480 RPM. 

Induction motors are naturally slower and run hotter than permanent magnet motors (like the one in the [GE Disposall Green 1/2 HP](https://healthykitchen101.com/garbage-disposals/reviews/ge/ge-disposall-green-1-2-hp/)). In particular, the E202 has overheated more than once since we first started testing our collection. Induction disposals can be extra prone to jamming or overheating when dealing with more stubborn food scraps, even more so when you increase the amount.

### 8.5 - Build Quality

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/evergrind-e202-1-2-hp-garbage-disposal-build-quality-clhfwqv3p000xuw88d2a7b8ya.jpg" alt="Evergrind E202 1/2 HP Garbage Disposal, with 3-Bolt Mount assembly on top and outlet/discharge set in place." width="300px" height="200px">

Noise Reduction: No

Vibration Reduction: No

The E202’s casing parts are securely fastened together with screws, in addition to being sealed with adhesive. It does not feature any noise-reducing or vibration-dampening which is expected from standard InSinkErator models. The galvanized steel inside might not be the best option, but it’s cost-effective. 

All that said, the disposal delivering poor results in performance evaluation had us questioning the motor’s quality.

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **7.6**

*   Installation (30%) - **8.0**/10
    
*   Ease of Use (40%) - **8.0**/10
    
*   Smooth Operation (25%) - **7.0**/10
    
*   Unjam Mechanics (5%) - **5.0**/10
    

The data we collected, especially the results in the Scrap Mix test, suggests that even common scraps in normal amounts could potentially give the Emerson Evergrind E202 a hard time. In specs, the disposal is a promising unit if it wasn’t for the machine’s disappointing motor.

### 8.0 - Ease of Use

The Evergrind E202 doesn’t offer much of anything besides robust construction and comfortable holding capacity. Its limited verticality and lack of a removable splash guard also affect the overall experience.

### 8.0 - Installation

The disposal is compact but it packs quite a lot of weight. The installation process can be easy or challenging depending on how familiar you are with the 3-bolt mounting system. There is a lot of useful information in the installation guide, so check it out if it’s your first time.

### 7.0 - Smooth Operation

The Evergrind E202 is not a subtle machine nor is it a strong one. It’s loud yet not as strong as it appears. You should go easy on it, starting with easy-to-grind food like fruits or root vegetables; fibrous veggies can be tricky in large amounts, and of course, no fruit pits or bones (even hollow ones).

### 5.0 - Unjam Mechanics

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/garbage-disposals/evergrind-e202-1-2-hp-garbage-disposal-unjam-mechanics-clhfyt4rv00013p887ibzbedk.jpg" alt="Bottom view of Evergrind E202 1/2-hp garbage disposal showing jam buster wrench in manual unjam slot." width="300px" height="200px">

External: Yes

Auto Unjam: No

The E202, akin to the other Insinkerator disposers, features an external unjam mechanism on the bottom of the machine.
