Being around for decades, garbage disposals (or food waste disposer) are an integral part of many households. Having such a convenient way to manage daily food waste in your kitchen is always helpful. If utilized properly, an in-sink grinder can reduce your waste output dramatically. That means your bins will fill up slower and you won’t have to worry as much about bugs and wild animals going through the garbage.

How We Test
-----------

Our main objective is to see how each garbage disposal dealt with different types of scraps and how effective they were in practice. Each unit’s **performance** was assessed based on the data we’ve collected via running tests. With each test designed to reflect aspects of practicality in using a kitchen disposal, there were three in total:

Scrap mix includes lemons, celery, potatoes, cooked bones, etc." width="360" height="240">

The **Scrap Mix** test highlighted the disposals’ ability to deal with common food scraps. In this test, selected units each took no longer than 4 minutes processing 90 ounces of 11 different types, including eggshells, lemons, potatoes, cooked bones, etc. We scored the units based on how fast they finished the test (time) and their output quality (Layer 1 and Layer 2).

The **Raw Fish Scraps** test was to challenge the limits of the disposals’ grinding capabilities. The selected units would take turns processing roughly 50 ounces of salmon scraps in under 3 minutes. There were bones, skin, fins, and tails in the mix. For this, we scored on output quality and output yield (Leftovers).

The **Raw Chicken Scraps** test further evaluates how the disposals handle different types of bones. To specify, selected units would take no longer than 3 minutes to grind through 4 sets of chicken thigh bones. Here, we scored their time, output quality, and output yield.

To inform our decisions, we also drew on insights from design inspection as well as our notes on each unit’s usability. **Grinding chamber**, **motor capacity**, and **build quality** were the main areas of our focus. Beyond technical evaluation, personal impressions as well as mishaps and malfunctions during installation/operation were all acknowledged.

How We Decide
-------------

In this list, our decisions and recommendations regarding the products’ ranking are based heavily on the evaluation scores. Ultimately, we take into account their grinding capabilities, their build quality, and their economical values in relation to how they performed. The availability of the products also affects the current list. 

Reviews of the Best Garbage Disposals in 2024
---------------------------------------------

After evaluating more than 20 different models, our data points to these garbage disposals as the best picks in key categories:

1. Best Overall: InSinkErator Evolution Excel 1 HP Garbage Disposal

*   Noise cancelation
*   Vibration damping
*   High-torque motor
*   Auto-reverse motor
*   Advanced chamber layout
*   Auto-unjam mechanics
*   Extra-large capacity
*   Stainless steel grinding components

*   Very heavy build
*   Space-consuming design
*   Expensive

Out of the 20 different models we’ve tested, the InSinkErator Evolution Excel takes the number 1 spot not simply thanks to its premium features, but also its top-tier performance.

In the Scrap Mix test, the disposal set a standard for the entire franchise as it only took **2 minutes** to plow through **90 ounces** of materials, leaving only **0.3 ounces** in the chamber. The disposal also released remarkable output quality with chart-topping figures on Layer 1 (**0.7 ounces**) and Layer 2 (**7.2 ounces**). 

Yet, the real highlights were from the challenge tests as we watched the Excel grind down raw meat scraps with ease. In Raw Fish Scrap, the disposal managed to reduce **50** **ounces** of salmon scraps down to only **0.1 ounce** in the chamber. The same thing went down in Raw Chicken Scrap as only **0.2 ounces** remained from the **7.5 ounces** of bones. 

Upon close inspection of the chamber, it became clear why the disposal was so effective. Compared to typical disposals, the Excel’s chamber is meticulously designed to break bones with the addition of extra grinding details and quality materials. Of course, the **1-horsepower** motor played no small role in how the disposal managed such incredible results.

What truly blew us away was how the disposal kept such a low noise profile while yielding the best output quality we had seen. The **anti-vibration connections** and the thick **soundproofing casing** worked wonders when they kept the grinder quiet and stabilized throughout the entire testing process.

While the Evolution is obviously expensive, it’s on another level entirely compared to the others in our collection. Not to mention the [10-year warranty](https://insinkerator.emerson.com/documents/evolution-excel-warranty-en-us-6867474.pdf) that wraps up the deal.

2\. Best 3/4-HP: GE GFC720N Continuous Feed 3/4 HP

*   Noise reduction
*   High-speed motor
*   Strengthened chamber layout
*   Stainless steel grinding components

*   Space-consuming design
*   Can be loud
*   No power cord

We prefer the GE GFC720N to the other mid-range units in our lab because the disposal consistently showed outstanding results coming out of the uncooked meat scraps challenge.

\[654\] The impellers inside the GE Disposall GFC720N

In Scrap Mix, the disposal demonstrated full competence in testing with a reassuring input-to-output ratio, reducing 90 ounces of input to **0.1 ounces** left over in just 2 minutes 30 seconds. Furthermore, the disposal produced decent output quality with **5.6 ounces** for Layer 1 and **16.6 ounces** for Layer 2.

The GFC720N took a commanding lead over its peers when it managed to bring 50 ounces of raw materials down to **1.2 ounces** leftovers in Raw Fish Scraps. Although its results from Raw Chicken Scraps, with **0.7 ounces** leftovers from 7.5 ounces input, weren’t as impressive, they weren't bad figures either.

The disposal’s thick stainless steel impellers are likely one of the factors that leads to such note-worthy results, aside from the high-speed, jamless magnet motor. With a rigid build and solid performance, the GE GFC720N 3/4 HP is a worthwhile product. The cost may be steep for this range, but that’s partially justified by the [product warranty](https://products.geappliances.com/MarketingObjectRetrieval/Dispatcher?RequestType=PDF&Name=49-5903-3.pdf&_ga=2.31718462.1453410145.1677639869-1854007382.1676432012) with up to 5-year for replacement parts.

3\. Best 1/2-HP: Waste King Legend 1/2 HP L-1001

*   High-speed motor
*   Affordable
*   Easy installation

*   Low capacity
*   No noise reduction

The Waste King L-1001 is no doubt one of the best small garbage disposals in the market with a compact design and adequate grinding power. 

\[655\] The Waste King L-1001 is also beloved for its space-saving dimensions

Most noticeable was how the disposal did better than the [Badger 1HP](https://healthykitchen101.com/garbage-disposals/reviews/insinkerator/insinkerator-badger-1-hp/) and the [Badger 5XP](https://healthykitchen101.com/garbage-disposals/reviews/insinkerator/insinkerator-badger-5xp-3-4-hp/) in **Scrap Mix**, both are larger and more expensive. Specifically, while all of them pulverized the input at much of the same rate, the L-1001 released more satisfying output quality with **9 ounces** and **17.9 ounces** for Layer 1 and 2 respectively.

Additionally, the L-1001, for such a humble unit, finished the raw meat scrap tests admirably while several others, including the two mentioned earlier, outright failed. For your information, the disposal produced **3.4 ounces** of leftovers in Raw Fish Scraps and **0.9 ounces** in Raw Chicken Scraps.

The disposal runs on very humble specs, with a low-power, high-speed magnet motor and a galvanized steel grinding assembly rust easily over time. Still, the [2-year warranty](https://products.geappliances.com/MarketingObjectRetrieval/Dispatcher?RequestType=PDF&Name=49-4000231.pdf&_ga=2.211068115.798747120.1677464399-1854007382.1676432012) and the affordable price tag sure make a bargain.

4. Best Value: AmazonCommercial 3/4 HP with Cord

*   Noise cancelation
*   High-speed motor
*   Stainless steel grind components
*   Lightweight build
*   Affordable

*   Can be loud

At first, we didn’t think much of the AmazonCommercial 3/4 HP because it belongs to a very new franchise. But we were pleasantly surprised when we put it to the tests. In fact, the disposal came close as the best 3/4-hp pick but the GE GFC720N is slightly more impressive.

\[656\] The bright orange of AmazonCommercial garbage disposals

The AmazonCommercial 3/4 HP went through Scrap Mix in roughly 2 minutes with **5 ounces** for Layer 1, **22 ounces** for Layer 2, and **0.2 ounces** of leftovers. Though the amounts caught by the two colanders were more than we would like, the disposal worked quickly. It also handled the challenge of raw meat scraps rather well with only **2.2 ounces** of leftovers from Raw Fish Scraps and **0.6 ounces** from Raw Chicken Scraps.

At under $100, it was a surprise to see the disposal sporting stainless steel components. But its overall build quality can be better, and Amazon only [warrants](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/616c9XCo3DL.pdf) the first year of use, so that’s probably why. Regardless, the AmazonCommercial 3/4 HP Garbage Disposal certainly offers great values for what little it costs.

Honorable Contenders
--------------------

*   The [InSinkErator Essential XTR](https://healthykitchen101.com/garbage-disposals/reviews/insinkerator/insinkerator-evolution-essential-xtr-3-4-hp/) is another splendid 3/4-hp disposal with quiet operation, quality build, and solid grinding performance. However, the disposal couldn’t yield consistent results in the raw scrap challenges. 
*   The [Moen GXS75C Host Series](https://healthykitchen101.com/garbage-disposals/reviews/moen/moen-gxs75c-3-4-hp/) is an up-and-coming disposal with a 3/4-hp jamless magnet motor. The disposal runs well and has been seeing a lot of positive reviews online but is still not quite good enough for an official spot on the list.
*   The [Waste King Legend L-8000](https://healthykitchen101.com/garbage-disposals/reviews/waste-king/waste-king-l-8000/) is another affordable, high-power option with a 1-hp motor and stainless steel components. If you want to upgrade your old Waste King, this could be worth checking out.

Things You Should Know
----------------------

When you’re buying a garbage disposal, keep in mind these important factors:

*   **Is it strong enough?** 1/2-HP and cheap 3/4-HP are best for plate-rinsers. Stronger and more advanced models are better for discarded scraps and leftover food.
*   **Is it jamless?** High-speed motors have a much lower risk of jamming than slow motors.
*   **Is it cordless?** Cordless models are for hardwiring configurations only.
*   **Is it too big?** Limited space aside, the existing waste line might be too high for your new disposal.

Our Expertise
-------------

Be Nguyen started his research on garbage disposal back in 2019, when he was preparing for some of his newest technical reviews. In 2022, sorting through dozens of different models, he, Luna, and Healthykitchen101’s test team began examining and testing the most promising food disposers in the market.

With 200+ pounds of common kitchen leftovers (fruit, vegetables, etc.) and 140+ pounds of raw meat scraps (chicken bones, salmon remains, etc.) processed, after 20+ hours spent in preparation and 40+ more in running tests, the team was able to collect crucial data regarding each product’s performance and usability. Working with garbage hasn’t been the most pleasant experience, but thanks to the shared efforts, the team has put together strongly informed reviews on every product as well as helpful recommendations.

FAQ
---

**What should I do when the garbage disposal is not working?**

If the disposal hums but doesn’t run when you flip the switch, there’s still power and the disposal is stuck. Find a way to rotate the chamber manually to unjam. If your [disposal does not turn on](https://healthykitchen101.com/garbage-disposals/tips/garbage-disposal-not-working/), there’s either a problem with the disposal’s internal circuit, the switch, or the kitchen circuit. You can try the disposal’s reset button or check the power supply (switch, outlet, breaker, etc.)

**How do I install a garbage disposal?**

First, set up a mounting assembly. You can use the old assembly if it fits and doesn’t leak. Next, hang the disposal onto the mounting assembly and secure it with tools. Finally, hook the disposal to the drainpipe. Connect the dishwasher if necessary. Check for leaks. You can find more detailed instructions in [this article](https://healthykitchen101.com/garbage-disposals/tips/how-to-install-garbage-disposal/)

**How do I unclog a garbage disposal?**

Use a plunger to [push through clogs](https://healthykitchen101.com/garbage-disposals/tips/how-to-repair-garbage-disposals/) and drain standing water. Next, remove and clean the pipes and p-trap. Use a plumbing snake to clear the waste line (into the wall or floor). Unjam and reset the garbage disposal if necessary and put everything back. Flush the line and check for leaks.

**How do I clean a garbage disposal?**

Try baking soda, vinegar, and hot water once a month or every two months for residual buildup. For regular [cleaning](https://healthykitchen101.com/garbage-disposals/tips/how-to-clean-garbage-disposals/), grind ice cubes, chopped citrus fruits (lemons, limes, etc.), and sea salt altogether to scour, disinfect, and deodorize the interior. 

**How do I reset a garbage disposal?**

Find a red button on the bottom half of your disposal. Some have it on the bottom, others on the front. The button pops out to break the circuit in case it overloads. Push it back to reset the machine.

**How long do garbage disposals last?**

Garbage disposals, or food waste disposers, often last years. Depending on the make and circumstance, some can stay operational after a decade. Cheaper models work well for the first couple of years. Most standard units easily last for more than 5 years with moderate maintenance.

**How do I get rid of the smell from garbage disposal?**

A combination of chopped lemons, ice cubes, and sea salt can be very effective at deodorizing garbage disposals. For better results, try flushing the disposal with baking soda, vinegar, and hot water before deodorizing.

**How do I fix a leaking garbage disposal?**

First, [locate the leak](https://healthykitchen101.com/garbage-disposals/tips/fixing-a-leaking-garbage-disposal/). If not installed properly, garbage disposals may leak from the collar, the outlet, the dishwasher inlet, or even from the bottom. In most cases, it’s usually improper installation where connections are not sealed or cleared. If yours is leaking from the bottom, chances are it’s a faulty unit or it’s too old. Either way, it’s best to opt for a replacement.
