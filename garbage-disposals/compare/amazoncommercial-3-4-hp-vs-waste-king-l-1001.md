Both the AmazonCommercial 3/4-HP and the Waste King L-1001 prove to be effective disposals, albeit with distinct strengths. The AmazonCommercial 3/4-HP is one of the strongest 3/4-HP units in its class. It features a powerful magnet motor that should handle various food types while effectively avoiding jamming. What’s more, the disposal’s sturdy construction and reasonable price adds to its appeal. 

On the other hand, the L-1001 is a capable yet much smaller unit. The disposal excels at tackling kitchen scraps compared to most other small disposals in our line-up, thanks to its high-speed, jam-resistant magnet motor. Additionally, its cost makes sense for a smaller unit.
