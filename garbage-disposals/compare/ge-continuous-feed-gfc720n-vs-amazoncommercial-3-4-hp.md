While the GE GFC720N 3/4-HP has a more solid build, the AmazonCommercial 3/4-HP is a much cheaper option. They both have considerable grinding power, but the GFC720N is a little better at breaking scraps up and avoiding clogging. That said, the AmazonCommercial is very close, performance wise, but only at half the price.

It’s worth noting that the GFC720N uses a different type of impeller that is thicker than those inside the AmazonCommercial, considering that both disposals follow the same design. Also, the AmazonCommercial doesn’t offer a 3-bolt adapter (for 3-bolt mounting) like the GE does.
