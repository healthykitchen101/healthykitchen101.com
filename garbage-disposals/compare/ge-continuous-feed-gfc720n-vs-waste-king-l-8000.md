Even though the Waste King L-8000 has a bigger motor with a higher power rating, the GE GFC720N still manages to deliver better results. Interestingly enough, they both run on permanent magnet motors, indicating a difference in the qualities of the motors. This could also explain why the L-8000 is much cheaper than the GFC720N.

To be fair, both are strong garbage disposals and can handle daily kitchen scraps with little hassle. Theyâ€™re also good at avoiding jamming thanks to the high speed motors, but the GFC720N feels slightly better constructed than the L-8000.
