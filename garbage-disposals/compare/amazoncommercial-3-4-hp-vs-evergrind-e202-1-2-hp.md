The AmazonCommercial 3/4-HP is a strong garbage disposal in the mid-range segment of the market, despite its unassuming appearance. It uses a permanent magnet motor and sturdy grinding parts to deliver powerful operations. This is reflected in how the disposal went through our performance evaluation tests, where it was able to provide superior results compared to several stronger and more expensive options.

The Emerson Evergrind E202 1/2-HP, on the other hand, is one of the poorest-performing models we’ve ever examined. The disposal looks like a low-tier or refurbished Badger 5, but with a worse motor. That wouldn’t sound like an overstatement if you had the chance to see how the disposals grind food like we did. Although it’s not costly, we still don’t recommend the Evergrind E202.
