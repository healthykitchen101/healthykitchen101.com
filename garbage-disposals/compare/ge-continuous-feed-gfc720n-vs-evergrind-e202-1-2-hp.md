The GE GFC720N is a powerful 3/4-HP garbage disposal. It utilizes a robust, high-speed permanent magnet motor that tackles assorted food scraps with little struggle. Plus, the fast-spinning operation avoids jamming even when there’s lots of food to deal with. Taking into consideration both its cost and performance, the disposal is arguably the most well-rounded mid-range grinder on the market.

By contrast, the Emerson Evergrind E202 is one of the poorest we’ve ever evaluated both in terms of build and power. The disposal is not the cheapest disposal out there, but its grinding capabilities are limited to simple and easy to process veggies and fruits. It’s also extremely prone to overheating, especially when you have large amounts of input. For the same price, you have better options available.
