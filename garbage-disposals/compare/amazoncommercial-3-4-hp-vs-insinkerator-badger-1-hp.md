One aspect we've learned about garbage disposals through experience is that their power ratings don't always correlate with their actual grinding performance. Here, we have a prime example of a seemingly "weaker" grinder outperforming a supposedly "stronger" one, as demonstrated by the AmazonCommercial 3/4-HP surpassing the InSinkErator Badger 1 HP in test results.

Admittedly, the Badger 1 HP boasts impressive construction quality, and InSinkErator's standard garbage disposals are renowned for their durability. However, itâ€™s quite an investment as the disposal comes at a much higher cost of approximately $145 compared to the AmazonCommercial 3/4-HP.
