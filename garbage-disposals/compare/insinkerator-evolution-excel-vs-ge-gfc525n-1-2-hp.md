The InSinkErator Evolution Excel is a powerful garbage disposal, sporting a vigorous motor and an intricate grinding chamber. It can quickly deal with all sorts of kitchen scraps and, drawing from our testing, even raw meat scraps. What’s more, the disposal’s noise canceling system is no-doubt the best we’ve seen. A big family with members who are sensitive to loud noises would definitely benefit the most from what the Excel has to offer.

The GE Disposall GFC525N is modest in configurations. It runs on a small motor and is built to be affordable. But the disposal is stronger than what it seems. Our testing shows that it can make quick work of cooked chicken bones and avocado pits without hassle. But the disposal is not good with large volumes of food and tricky materials like raw fish bones.
