The InSinkErator Evolution Excel is a powerful, top-quality food disposal system. It doesn’t shy away from large volumes of tough kitchen waste, including raw meat and bones, and it runs incredibly quiet. This is thanks to the disposal’s advanced noise-canceling feature that is unmatched on the market. Big household would love something like the Excel
