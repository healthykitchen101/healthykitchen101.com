Coming from the same series, the Evolution Excel and the Evolution Essential XTR share a number of features. Most notably is the exclusive SoundSeal technology and the multi-stage design for the grinding chamber.

The Evolution Excel, however, is better on all fronts. For example, it enjoys a thicker, more layered body casing that enhances noise insulation. That means even quieter operation. Other than that, the Evolution Excelâ€™s chamber is also more nuanced than that of the Evolution Essential XTR. This is evidenced by the results from running our performance tests.
