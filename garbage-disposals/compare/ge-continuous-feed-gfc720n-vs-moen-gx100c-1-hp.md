It was a total surprise to see the GE GFC720N outperforming the Moen Chef GX100C in the tests. Truth be told, we had expected the Moen to be the better one because of how they look.Â 

As it turned out, the GE GFC720N was a complete beast as it went through the tests pretty decisively, save for some parts of the raw scrap challenges. Moreover, it effortlessly handled large quantities of typical food scraps with speed and thoroughness.

Both the GE GFC720N and the Moen Chef employ strong magnet motors, excelling at avoiding jamming. Yet, the Moen Chef appears to be the weaker one as it consistently delivers poorer output quality. Our speed test also reveals that it runs slower.
