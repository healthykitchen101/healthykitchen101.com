The Frigidaire FF05DISPC1 1/2-HP is something we would normally buy simply because it looks quite nice for its price point. Only when we ran the disposal through performance testing did we realize its limitations. It doesn’t process food scraps really well, and the impellers in the grinding chamber are prone to getting stuck. In our case, it was the thin bones from the fish scraps that kept lodging and immobilized the impellers.

The InSinkErator Evolution Excel 1-HP is the exact opposite. It’s a much bigger unit and that offers outstanding values. It’s also the most expensive yet most capable garbage disposal we’ve tested so far. The grinder can process virtually any type of kitchen scraps, cooked or raw. Plus, it’s incredibly well-built, which makes it an alluring long-term investment.
