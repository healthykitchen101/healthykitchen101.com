The Ovente Electric Glass Kettle KG83B is a pretty average product. Its strongest points are low energy consumption at a very low price. This means, you can at least save money in the long run. That is, if you don’t mind the slow boiling time and inconvenient button placement.

**Things We Like**

*   Very low price tag
*   Low energy consumption
*   Quiet boiling phase
*   Light weight
*   Easy to use

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Small capacity
*   Slow boiling time
*   Inconvenient button placement

We bought the Ovente Electric Glass Kettle KG83B on Amazon for $20.98 (at the time of writing), and even at a first glance we noticed potential issues. It had a smaller than usual capacity and confusing button placements. Additionally, our first boil revealed a slow boiling time. Of course, we still needed to put it through our complete testing procedure before making any final evaluation.

This model does have a very low price tag. In addition to the white version that we chose, it also comes in black, fuschia pink, yellow, maroon, orange, purple, and red.

The Ovente Electric Glass Kettle scored well in our Energy Consumption, Noise Level, and Keep Warm tests. However, its slow boiling time really dragged it down.

### Boiling Time

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/ovente-glass-electric-kettle-kg83b-boiling-time-clnjzvuda000h74880q5i6b86.jpg" alt="1.5 liter of water boiling inside the Ovente Electric Glass Kettle (KG83B). The digital timer displays 09 minutes and 40 seconds." width="300px" height="200px">

Room Temperature: 80°F (26.7°C)

Water Volume: 1.5 liters

Boiling Time: 9m 40s

For the common electric kettles (not goosenecks) like the Ovente, we evaluate the time they take to boil 1.5 liters of water—a middle ground of their capacity. This kettle took 9 minutes and 40 seconds to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water (80°F/26.7°C) to boiling point (212°F/100°C).

This result was exceedingly slow, even when considering the kettle’s 1100 W of power, and earned only a score of 5.3/10.

### Energy Consumption

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/ovente-glass-electric-kettle-kg83b-energy-consumption-clnjzwm7s000i74887nc63ht6.jpg" alt="The power meter reads the energy consumption of the Ovente Electric Glass Kettle (KG83B) to be 150 Wh." width="300px" height="200px">

Voltage: 113 V

Current: 8.215 A

Power: 929 W

Energy Consumption: 150 Wh

We used a power meter to measure the Ovente’s total energy consumption to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water to a rolling boil. The result was 150 Wh which was our standard for an 8/10 score.

### Noise Level

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/ovente-glass-electric-kettle-kg83b-noise-level-clnjzwy5c000j7488dfd6938r.jpg" alt="The Ovente Electric Glass Kettle (KG83B) is boiling 1.5 liters of water. The noise meter displays the maximum sound pressure level to be 67.5 dB. The power meter reads 113 V, 8.125 A, 929 W, 100 Wh, 50 Hz, and 1.0 PF." width="300px" height="200px">

Noise Level: 67.5 dB

During boiling, the Ovente’s noise level peaked at 67.5 dB while reaching a rolling simmer, which was significantly lower than the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hearing_loss/what_noises_cause_hearing_loss.html#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency,prevent%20noise%2Dinduced%20hearing%20loss.)\-recommended 80 dB. This result earned the kettle an impressive 9.3/10.

### Keep Warm

In the middle is the Ovente Electric Glass Kettle (KG83B) with 1.5 liters of water and two probes inside. On the right is a digital timer on a 5 minute countdown." width="300px" height="200px">

After 5 Minutes: 202°F / 95°C

The glass carafe of the Ovente doesn’t have the best property for heat retention. The kettle also doesn’t have the Keep Warm feature. As a result, after 5 minutes, the temperature dropped from 212°F / 100°C to 202°F / 95°C. This equates to a 7/10 according to our data.

The Ovente Electric Glass Kettle’s small capacity doesn’t affect its build quality. In addition, it has all the design features we want in an electric kettle, including a mesh filter, water-level markings, and an LED ring.

### In the Box

Capacity: 50.7 fl oz (1.5 L)

Weight: 1.8 oz (50 g)

Materials: Borosilicate glass

Spout: V-shaped

Opening Diameter: 3.5" (9.0 cm)

LED Ring: Blue

Filter: Removable mesh

Water Level Markings: Yes

Tea Infuser: No

The carafe is made of glass and has a slightly smaller capacity than usual—1.5 L, 50.72 fl. oz, or a bit over 6 cups—but that’s not an issue (+2). Despite its size, it has a wide lid opening, 3.54 inches in diameter, allowing you to comfortably pour in water from your tap or any container (+1).

There are clear water level markings in the middle of the carafe (+1). The Ovente has quite a unique V-shaped spout that is shaped out of the glass carafe itself. As a result, the limescale filter can’t be attached to the spout like other kettles.Instead, it’s attached to and positioned by the lid and is unremovable (+1).

Similar to many other cordless electric kettles, the Ovente’s heating element is positioned inside the bottom of the carafe. There’s a ring of blue LED around the bottom which will illuminate when the kettle’s running, making it easy to spot in the dark (+2).

### 7.0 - Handle

Materials: Cool-touch BPA-free plastic

Type: Cool-touch, anti-slip

The cool-touch handle is made of BPA-free plastic (+3). It doesn’t have an ergonomic contour or anti-slip feature, but feels secure and comfortable on the wrist nonetheless (+4). The Ovente, however, has an awkward design of the lid open button and the power switch being close to one another on the handle.

### 7.0 - Lid

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/ovente-glass-electric-kettle-kg83b-handle-clnk03f4p000r7488320a0j47.jpg" alt="The black pop-up lid of the Ovente Electric Glass Kettle (KG83B)." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/ovente-glass-electric-kettle-kg83b-lid-1-clnk07sel000s74887l231zj0.jpg" alt="The pop-up lid of the Ovente Electric Glass Kettle (KG83B) opens at an 80° angle." width="300px" height="200px">

Materials: BPA-free plastic

Type: Hinged

Open Mechanism: Push-button pop-up

The Ovente has a hinged lid that pop-ups to a 80° angle with a single push of a button located on the handle (+4). That angle is good enough for the lid to move out of the way to get water in despite the attached limescale filter (+2).

The lid’s exterior and interior are both plastic which means some contact between plastic and hot water is unavoidable. Nonetheless, we noticed no odd odor during the first boil.

Unlike some other electric kettles we’ve tested, this one doesn’t have a silicone band around the circumference. Regardless, the lid still closes tightly (+1). It’s not cool-touch though, so be careful when the water’s still hot.

### 9.0 - Base

Materials: BPA-free plastic

Type: Swivel 360°

Cord Storage: Yes

The Ovente has a standard BPA-free plastic 360° swivel base that’s sturdy and fits the carafe well enough (+5). At the bottom of the base is the cord storage in addition to  three small anti-slip rubber pads (+4).

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/ovente-glass-electric-kettle-kg83b-power-cord-clnk0b2pq000v7488et3w5l07.jpg" alt="The three-pronged plug of the Ovente Electric Glass Kettle (KG83B)." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/ovente-glass-electric-kettle-kg83b-power-cord-1-clnmpm348000a2a8843v55qoh.jpg" alt="The three-pronged round power cord of the Ovente Electric Glass Kettle (KG83B) is 29.53 inches long (75 cm)." width="300px" height="200px">

Type: three-pronged plug

Power: 1100 W

Rated Output: 120 V ~ 60 Hz

Cord Placement: Base

Cord Length: 29.5" (75.0 cm)

The Ovente has a 29.53 inch round power cord, which should be enough for household use. It has a three-prong grounded plug which is typically safer than a two-pronged one.

Usability

*   Cleaning (20%) - **6.0**/undefined
    

The main issue with the usability of the Ovente Electric Glass Kettle is its button placement. The risk of accidentally pushing one button instead of the other is just unnecessary frustration to an otherwise easy to use and clean kettle.

### 6.0 - User Control

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/ovente-glass-electric-kettle-kg83b-user-control-clnk0c5xd000w74881gp4befm.jpg" alt="The handle of the Ovente Electric Glass Kettle (KG83B) has two buttons, the one above is the lid button and below is the power switch." width="300px" height="200px">

Control: One touch

Indicator Light: No

Display: No

Temperature Control: No

Presets: No

Keep Warm: No

Automatic Shut-Off: Yes

Boil-Dry Protection: Yes

The Ovente has a standard one-touch switch with no digital display or temperature control (+1). However, the power switch is awkwardly positioned right below the lid button (-1).

The kettle doesn’t have an indicator light inside the switch like many of its peers. Thankfully, the carafe still has a blue LED ring to let you know the kettle is running (+2).

Like most other kettles, it has an automatic shutoff feature which activates when the thermal fuse detects that the ambient temperature is 100°C (+2). Keep in mind that this feature will not kick in if you leave the lid open. If you do, however, you still don’t have to worry about overheating because the kettle’s boil-dry protection feature will turn off the kettle when no water is present (+2).

### 7.0 - Ease of Use

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/ovente-glass-electric-kettle-kg83b-ease-use-clnmpngiw000b2a88e48w7ac2.jpg" alt="A person in a grey shirt pouring water from the Ovente Electric Glass Kettle (KG83B) into a glass." width="300px" height="200px">

The singular  control of the Ovente is complicated by being close to the lid button. On more than one occasion, we accidentally pushed one instead of the other (+0), hence a common issue likely to occur.

On the bright side, the carafe was very light—less than 2 lbs (0.9 kg). Also, the button placement doesn’t make the handle tricky to hold in any way. The carafe was also sturdy enough to be carried around when filled to the max (+2).

The wide lid opening of 3.54 inches allowed us to comfortably pour in water from the tap or any container (+1). The water level markings in the middle of the carafe are easy to see for precise decanting (+1).

We found no odd odor during the first boil—a sign of good material quality and upkeep before delivery. The nice angle between the arm and the kettle made pouring effortless (+1).

The power base fits firmly below its carafe so there is no wobbling around during boiling (+1). Thanks to the cord’s round shape, it wrapped tightly around for storage leaving only the plug sticking out by 2.76 inches (7 cm).

### 6.0 - Cleaning

Cleaning the Ovente is very simple and effortless (+2). The lid opening is large enough for an adult hand to fit through and wipe the interior when necessary (+2). The limescale filter isn’t removable but the lid opens at a wide enough angle for it to not get in the way of anything (+2).
