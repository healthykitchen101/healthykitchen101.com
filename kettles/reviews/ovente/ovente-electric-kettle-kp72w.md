All things considered, the Ovente Electric Kettle KP72W has the main benefits of being light in weight and cheap in price. However, the kettle’s plastic material may be a cause for health concerns and not as long-lasting as glass or stainless steel products.

**Things We Like**

*   Consumes little energy
*   Low price tag
*   Quiet boiling pase
*   Extremely light weight

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Slow boiling speed
*   Loses heat quickly

Right off the bat, the design of the Ovente Electric Kettle KP72W gave us an impression that it wasn’t of very high quality. And then the first trial boil gave a slow speed as well.

To be fair, its price of $17.96 on Amazon (at the time of writing) probably didn’t promise much. Nonetheless, we can only give our final verdict after we thoroughly test this product.On a side note, this model also comes in red, pink, and green.

The Ovente Electric Kettle consumes little energy for boiling and it’s very quiet on the job as well. However, it takes its sweet time to boil water and its plastic carafe loses heat quite quickly.

### Boiling Time

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/ovente-electric-kettle-kp72w-boiling-time-clnli23br0004ra88eync927l.jpg" alt="1.5 liter of water boiling inside the Ovente Electric Kettle KP72W. The digital timer displays 09 minutes and 20 seconds." width="300px" height="200px">

Room Temperature: 80°F

Water Volume: 1.5 liters

Boiling Time: 9m 20s

For the common electric kettles (not gooseneck) like the Ovente, we evaluate the time they take to boil 1.5 liters of water—a middle ground of their capacity. The product took 9 minutes and 20 seconds to bring the room-temperature water (80°F/26.7°C) to boiling point (212°F/100°C).

This result was extremely slow, even when considering the kettle’s modest 1100 W of power. Thus we had no choice but give it a 5.7/10.

### Energy Consumption

Voltage: 113 V

Current: 8.352 A

Power: 940 W

Energy Consumption: 146 Wh

We used a power meter to measure the Ovente’s total energy consumption to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water to a rolling boil. The result was 146 Wh which was quite low and equaled to an 8.8/10 according to our data. Interestingly, this model consumed significantly less energy than the KG83B glass model from the same brand.

### Noise Level

The noise meter displays the maximum sound pressure level to be 67.8 dB. The power meter reads 113 V, 8.352 A, 940 W, 0.93 Wh, 50 Hz, and 1.0 PF." width="300px" height="200px">

Noise Level: 67.8 dB

During boiling, the Ovente’s noise level peaked at 67.8 dB while reaching a rolling simmer, which was significantly lower than the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hearing_loss/what_noises_cause_hearing_loss.html#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency,prevent%20noise%2Dinduced%20hearing%20loss.)\-recommended 80 dB. This result was better than many kettles in our chart and earned the kettle a whopping 9.2/10.

### Keep Warm

On the right is a digital timer displaying 5 minutes on the countdown." width="300px" height="200px">

After 5 Minutes: 201°F / 94.5°C

The plastic carafe of the Ovente is not the best material for heat retention. The kettle also doesn’t have temperature control for the Keep Warm feature. As a result, after 5 minutes, the temperature dropped from 212°F / 100°C to 201°F / 94.5°C. This was a common outcome and equated to a 6.5/10 in our data.

The main problem of the Ovente Electric Kettle’s design is its overall low build quality. However, when taking the price into consideration, the product didn’t take any significant shortcut besides its material. It still has a removable mesh filter and a water-level window that we look for in a kettle.

### In the Box

Capacity: 57.5 fl oz (1.7 L)

Weight: 1.2 oz (34 g)

Materials: BPA-free plastic

Spout: V-shaped

Opening Diameter: 3.0" (7.5 cm)

LED Ring: No

Filter: Removable mesh

Water Level Markings: Yes

Tea Infuser: No

The carafe is made of BPA-free plastic and has a capacity of 1.7 L, 57.48 fl. oz, or 7 cups (+1). Its opening is smaller than its peers—2.95 inches in diameter (+0).

The plastic spout of the Ovente has a standard V shape. The limescale filter is positioned by the spout and is removable (+2).

Similar to many other cordless electric kettles, the Ovente’s heating element is positioned inside the bottom of the carafe. There’s a water-level window with black markings in the middle of the carafe (+1).

The kettle doesn’t have an LED ring around the carafe’s bottom, only one white LED that’s connected straight to and located on top of the heating plate (+1). It’s not as eye-catching as others but still enough to spot in the dark.

### 7.0 - Handle

Materials: Cool-touch BPA-free plastic

Type: Cool-touch, anti-slip

The cool-touch handle is made of BPA-free plastic (+3). It doesn’t have an ergonomic contour or anti-slip feature, but feels secure and comfortable on the wrist nonetheless (+4). Different from the majority of electric kettles, the Ovente’s power switch is located on its handle.

### 7.0 - Lid

Materials: BPA-free plastic

Type: Hinged

Open Mechanism: Push-button pop-up

The Ovente has a hinged lid that pops up to a 80° angle with a single push of a button located in the middle of the lid (+5). Since the lid doesn’t have a stay-cool area, be careful not to scald yourself because of the steam when opening the lid.

The lid has a plastic exterior and interior which can be undesirable for someone who doesn’t like their water coming into contact with plastic material. Unlike some other electric kettles we’ve tested, this one doesn’t have a silicone band around the circumference. Regardless, the lid still closes tightly (+1).

### 7.0 - Base

Materials: BPA-free plastic

Type: 360°

Cord Storage: Yes

The Ovente has a standard BPA-free plastic 360° swivel base that’s sturdy and fits the carafe well enough (+5). At the bottom of the base is the cord storage but no anti-slip rubber pads like most other electric kettles (+2).

### Power Cord

Type: three-pronged plug

Power: 1100 W

Rated Output: 120 V ~ 60 Hz

Cord Placement: Base

Cord Length: 32.4" (82.3 cm)

The Ovente has a 32.40 inch round power cord, which should be plenty enough for household use. It has a three-pronged plug which is typically safer than a two-pronged one by having a grounding wire.

Usability

The main advantage that the Ovente Electric Kettle offers is its extremely light weight. However, its biggest drawback to consumers is also from what makes it light—its plastic material. In addition, the kettle could have better indicator lighting and a larger opening for cleaning.

### 5.0 - User Control

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/ovente-electric-kettle-kp72w-user-control-clnmpurpw000e2a8881z32qwx.jpg" alt="The power switch located on the handle of the Ovente Electric Kettle KP72W." width="300px" height="200px">

Control: One touch

Indicator Light: White LED

Display: No

Temperature Control: No

Presets: No

Keep Warm: No

Automatic Shut-Off: Yes

Boil-Dry Protection: Yes

The Ovente has a standard one-touch switch located on its handle with no digital display or temperature control (+1). It also acts as the indicator light which will illuminate with a white LED when the kettle is running (+1). However, we thought the light could be more powerful since its white color already didn’t stand out very much, especially during the day (-1).

The kettle has an automatic shutoff feature which activates when the thermal fuse detects that the temperature has reached boiling point (+2). Keep in mind that this feature will not kick in if you leave the lid open. If you do, however, you still don’t have to worry about overheating because the kettle’s boil-dry protection feature will turn off the kettle when no water is present (+2).

### 9.0 - Ease of Use

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/ovente-electric-kettle-kp72w-ease-use-clnlil47r000jra886zklgc68.jpg" alt="A person in a grey shirt pouring water from the Ovente Electric Kettle KP72W  into a glass." width="300px" height="200px">

The biggest advantage of the Ovente being plastic is that it’s just a little one pound—the lightest among our tested electric kettles. In addition, its handle felt good in the hand and seemed sturdy when we picked the kettle up—it was filled with water to the max (+2).

Now, we understand that there are people who don’t like their water coming into contact with plastic for health reasons. And we can’t guarantee that this kettle won’t cause any problem in that regard. Nonetheless, we found no plastic smell during the first boil.

The kettle is simple to use, with only two distinctive buttons—one for power and one for opening the lid (+2). The power base fits firmly below its carafe so the entire thing doesn’t wobble around during boiling (+1).

The Ovente has a good pouring angle between the arm and the kettle, making the action effortless (+1). Its opening is slightly small but still enough for you to comfortably pour in water from your tap or any container (+1). The water level markings are in the middle of the carafe for easy viewing and precise decanting (+1).

With the cord’s round shape, even though it didn’t wrap the tightest around its storage, it went around perfectly. After wrapping, basically only the plug sticks out—2.76 inches.

### 6.0 - Cleaning

Cleaning the Ovente is a bit tricky since you can’t fit your hand through the opening to wipe the interior (+0). Thus, you’ll need a clamp to do so and the lid doesn’t get in the way of that (+4). On the other hand, the limescale filter is removable for frequent cleaning and maintenance (+2).
