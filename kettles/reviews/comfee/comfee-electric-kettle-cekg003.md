All things considered, the Comfee Electric Kettle CEKG003 is an all-around good glass kettle. It shows a positive performance, except for maybe its comparatively high energy consumption.

It’s easy to use and has all the desirable design features as well. If only the cord storage was better designed though. Nonetheless, we think its affordability, in addition to everything, makes it a good budget choice.

**Things We Like**

*   Highly inexpensive
*   Quiet when boiling
*   Easy to use
*   Light weight
*   Large capacity
*   Pretty fast boiling time
*   Long cord

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   High energy consumption
*   Cord doesn’t fit storage

The next product in line for our testing is the Comfee Glass Electric Kettle CEKG003 with a glass carafe and black plastic base. Our first impression of the kettle upon first interactions was that it had a solid design, a fast boiling time, and a shockingly cheap price of $26.17 on Amazon (at the time of writing). So let’s get into it to see if our judgement was biased because of the kettle’s price.

On a side note, this kettle has other similar models if you’re interested. One has a glass carafe and stainless steel base, one has a stainless steel carafe with a water level window, and one has a stainless steel carafe but without a water level window.

The Comfee Glass Electric Kettle has a pretty fast and very quiet boiling phase. However, it consumes quite a bit more energy compared to other kettles on our list. Its ability to keep warm isn’t anything to write home about either.

### Boiling Time

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/comfee-electric-kettle-cekg003-boiling-time-clnk3u5gp001z748881cpdgc9.jpg" alt="1.5 liter of water boiling inside the Comfee Glass Electric Kettle (CEKG003). The digital timer displays 7 minutes and 34 seconds." width="300px" height="200px">

Room Temperature: 80°F

Water Volume: 50.72 fl. oz. (1.5 liters)

Boiling Time: 7m 34s

For the common electric kettles (not gooseneck) like the Comfee, we evaluate the time they take to boil 1.5 liters of water—a middle ground of their capacity. The product took 7 minutes and 34 seconds to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water (80°F/26.7°C) to boiling point (212°F/100°C).

### Energy Consumption

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/comfee-electric-kettle-cekg003-energy-consumption-clnk3v6cb0020748897zr4q4u.jpg" alt="The power meter reads the energy consumption of the Comfee Glass Electric Kettle (CEKG003) to be 161 Wh." width="300px" height="200px">

Voltage: 113 V

Current: 11.40 A

Power: 1280 W

Energy Consumption: 161 Wh

We used a power meter to measure the Comfee’ total energy consumption to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water to a rolling boil. The result was 161 Wh which was a lot of energy. Comparing it to other kettles in our data, this one could only get a 5.8/10.

### Noise Level

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/comfee-electric-kettle-cekg003-noise-level-clnk3vvt500217488gzig4ggl.jpg" alt="The Comfee Glass Electric Kettle (CEKG003) is boiling 1.5 liters of water. The noise meter displays the maximum sound pressure level to be 71.5 dB. The power meter reads 113 V, 11.10 A, 1.28 kW, 0.72 Wh, 50 Hz, and 1.0 PF." width="300px" height="200px">

The Comfee Glass Electric Kettle CEKG003 reaches a maximum of 71.5 dB while boiling.

Noise Level: 71.5 dB

During boiling, the Comfee’s noise level peaked at 71.5 dB while reaching a rolling simmer, which was lower than the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hearing_loss/what_noises_cause_hearing_loss.html#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency,prevent%20noise%2Dinduced%20hearing%20loss.)\-recommended 80 dB. This result showed that the kettle was very quiet while boiling and earned the kettle an 8.9/10.

### Keep Warm

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/comfee-electric-kettle-cekg003-keep-warm-clnk3wox500227488dwfyc1in.jpg" alt="On the right is a Thermo Pro two-probe digital thermometer displaying 200°F for both probes. In the middle is the Comfee Glass Electric Kettle (CEKG003) with 1.5 liters of water and two probes inside. On the right is a digital timer displaying 5 minutes on the countdown." width="300px" height="200px">

After 5 Minutes: 200°F / 94°C

The glass carafe of the Comfee doesn’t have the best material for heat retention. The kettle also doesn’t have temperature control for the Keep Warm feature. As a result, after 5 minutes, the temperature dropped from 212°F / 100°C to 200°F / 94°C. This equates to a 6/10 according to our data.

The Comfee Glass Electric Kettle has a pretty standard design but the build quality is quite high. It also has all the desirable features, including a mesh filter, a blue LED ring, a large opening, and a pop-up lid.

### In the Box

Capacity: 57.5 fl oz (1.7 L)

Weight: 2.1 oz (59 g)

Materials: Borosilicate glass

Spout: V-shaped

Opening Diameter: 3.9" (10.0 cm)

LED Ring: Blue

Filter: Fixed mesh filter

Water Level Markings: Yes

Tea Infuser: No

The carafe is made of glass and has a capacity of 1.7 L, 57.48 fl. oz., or 7 cups (+2). It has a large opening, 3.94 inches in diameter, allowing you to comfortably pour in water from your tap or any container (+1).

There are water level markings in the middle of the carafe (+1). The Comfee has quite a unique V-shaped spout that is shaped out of the glass carafe itself. As a result, the limescale filter can’t be attached to the spout like other kettles but is positioned by the lid and is unremovable (+1).

Similar to many other cordless electric kettles, the Comfee’s heating element is positioned inside the bottom of the carafe. There’s a ring of blue LED around the bottom which will illuminate when the kettle’s running, making it easy to spot in the dark (+2).

### 7.0 - Handle

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/comfee-electric-kettle-cekg003-handle-clnmpgcrq00082a88b9eaf8bl.jpg" alt="A hand holding the Comfee Glass Electric Kettle (CEKG003) by its handle." width="300px" height="200px">

Materials: BPA-free plastic

Type: Cool-touch

The cool-touch handle is made of BPA-free plastic (+3). Its design is standard, without an ergonomic contour or anti-slip feature, but feels secure and comfortable on the wrist nonetheless (+4).

### 7.0 - Lid

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/comfee-electric-kettle-cekg003-lid-clnk45ny9002a7488by5h0mur.jpg" alt="The pop-up lid of the Comfee Glass Electric Kettle (CEKG003)." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/comfee-electric-kettle-cekg003-lid-1-clnk462ke002b7488gggc57xw.jpg" alt="The pop-up lid of the Comfee Glass Electric Kettle (CEKG003) opens at an 75° angle." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/comfee-electric-kettle-cekg003-lid-2-clnk479c7002c7488dow6dso0.jpg" alt="The mesh filter attached to the hinged lid of the Comfee Glass Electric Kettle (CEKG003)." width="300px" height="200px">

Materials: BPA-free plastic

Type: Hinged

Open Mechanism: Push-button pop-up

The Comfee has a hinged lid that pop-ups to a 75° angle with a single push of a button located on the handle (+4). That angle is good enough for the lid to move out of the way to get water in despite its fixed filter (+2).

The lid’s exterior and interior is simply plastic which can be undesirable for someone who doesn’t like their water coming into contact with plastic material. Nonetheless, we found no odd odor during the first boil.

Unlike some other electric kettles we’ve tested, this one doesn’t have a silicone band around the circumference. Regardless, the lid still closes tightly (+1). It’s not cool-touch though, so be careful not to touch it when the water’s still hot.

### 9.0 - Base

Materials: BPA-free plastic

Type: Swivel 360°

Cord Storage: Yes

The Comfee has a standard BPA-free plastic 360° swivel base that’s sturdy and fits the carafe well enough (+5). At the bottom of the base is the cord storage and also three small anti-slip silicone pads (+4).

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/comfee-electric-kettle-cekg003-power-cord-clnk49x99002f7488gpn4e5xb.jpg" alt="The three-pronged plug of the Comfee Glass Electric Kettle (CEKG003)." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/comfee-electric-kettle-cekg003-power-cord-1-clnmpf56h00072a88hxkvc83u.jpg" alt="The two-pronged flat power cord of the Comfee Glass Electric Kettle (CEKG003) is 29.72 inches long (75.5 cm)." width="300px" height="200px">

Type: two-pronged plug

Power: 1500 W

Rated Output: 120 V ~ 60 Hz

Cord Placement: Base

Cord Length: 29.7" (75.5 cm)

The Comfee has a 29.72-inch flat power cord, which should be enough for household use. The cord uses a two-pronged plug which is typically considered not as safe as a three-pronged one. Nonetheless, it should be safe since the power base doesn’t have a metal casing but a plastic one.

Usability

*   Cleaning (20%) - **6.0**/undefined
    

With a standard design, we didn’t expect the Comfee Glass Electric Kettle to excel at usability in any way. So, the fact that it was easy to use, carry, pour, and clean was all we wanted. If there’s anything to complain about, it would be that the cord didn’t wrap neatly around its storage.

### 7.0 - User Control

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/comfee-electric-kettle-cekg003-user-control-clnk4b0ja002g7488ekzcgi36.jpg" alt="The clear plastic power switch of the Comfee Glass Electric Kettle (CEKG003)." width="300px" height="200px">

Control: One touch

Indicator Light: Blue LED

Display: No

Temperature Control: No

Presets: No

Keep Warm: No

Automatic Shut-Off: Yes

Boil-Dry Protection: Yes

The Comfee has a standard one-touch switch with no digital display or temperature control (+1).

The power switch is made of clear plastic and is positioned near the bottom of the carafe along the handle. It also acts as the indicator light which will illuminate with a blue LED when the kettle is running (+2).

The kettle has an automatic shutoff feature which will activate when the thermo fuse detects that the temperature has reached boiling point (+2). Keep in mind that this feature will not kick in if you leave the lid open. If you do, however, you still don’t have to worry about overheating because the kettle’s boil-dry protection feature will turn off the kettle when no water is present (+2).

### 8.0 - Ease of Use

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/comfee-electric-kettle-cekg003-ease-use-clnk4bqmu002h7488ghyxhrei.jpg" alt="A person in a grey shirt pouring water from the Comfee Glass Electric Kettle (CEKG003) into a glass." width="300px" height="200px">

The Comfee is extremely simple to use, with only two distinctive buttons—one for power and one for opening the lid (+2).

The carafe felt very light when we picked it up—it’s only slightly more than 2 lbs (+2). Holding its handle felt good in the hand and was sturdy enough to be carried around when filled with water to the max. The pouring angle between the arm and the kettle was good as well, making the action effortless (+1).

The large opening of 3.94 inches allowed us to comfortably pour in water from the tap or any container (+1).  The water level markings are in the middle of the carafe for easy viewing and precise decanting (+1).

The power base fits firmly below its carafe so the entire thing doesn’t wobble around during boiling (+1). Due to the flat shape of the cord, it was impossible for us to wrap it tightly around its storage. After storing, the cord stuck out for 6.89 inches, including the plug.

### 6.0 - Cleaning

Cleaning the Comfee is very simple and effortless (+2). The opening is large enough for an adult hand to fit through and wipe the interior when necessary (+2). The limescale filter isn’t removable but the lid opens at a wide enough angle for it to not get in the way of anything (+2).
