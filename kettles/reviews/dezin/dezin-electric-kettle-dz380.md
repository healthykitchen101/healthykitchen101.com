*   Design (25%) - **5.9**/10
    
*   Usability (35%) - **6.6**/10
    

The Dezin Electric Glass Kettle DZ380 has an extremely quiet boiling phase while consuming a standard amount of energy. It also has better heat retention than a lot of similar glass kettles. However, its slow boiling speed really sour the experience.

Moreover, we’ve had some highly affordable kettle but this was a rare occasion where the design was a letdown. The filter was basically useless and the kettle having no cord storage made it difficult to manage.

**Things We Like**

*   Low price tag
*   Large capacity
*   Quiet boiling phase
*   Light weight
*   Easy to use

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Inconvenient flip-lock lid
*   Slow boiling time
*   No limescale filter
*   No cord storage

We bought the Dezin Electric Glass Kettle DZ380 on Amazon for $22.99 (at the time of writing), which was very affordable. We chose the glass model for reviewing but there’s also a stainless steel model.

On the first look, the kettle’s lid open mechanism is quite unfamiliar to us. And, our first test run showed a slow boiling speed. Hopefully, the full test will reveal some saving grace.

The Dezin Electric Glass Kettle has one of the best Noise Level scores we’ve had so far. Unfortunately, its Boiling Time result is the complete opposite. Its above-average energy consumption and heat retention couldn’t help much.

### Boiling Time

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/dezin-electric-kettle-dz380-boiling-time-clo457u33001eel88amsj1311.jpg" alt="1.5 liters of water boiling inside the Dezin Electric Glass Kettle DZ380. The digital timer displays 08 minutes and 56 seconds." width="300px" height="200px">

Room Temperature: 80°F (26.7°C)

Water Volume: 50.72 fl. oz. (1.5 liters)

Boiling Time: 8m 56s

For the common electric kettles (not goosenecks) like the Dezin, we evaluate the time they take to boil 1.5 liters of water—a middle ground of their capacity. This kettle took 8 minutes and 56 seconds to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water (80°F/26.7°C) to boiling point (212°F/100°C).

This time was noticeably slow, only worthy of a 6/10 score. Nonetheless, we expected this result looking at the kettle’s 1000 W of power.

### Energy Consumption

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/dezin-electric-kettle-dz380-energy-consumption-clo45960b001fel888x8bbv0t.jpg" alt="The power meter reads the energy consumption of the Dezin Electric Glass Kettle DZ380 to be 150 Wh." width="300px" height="200px">

Voltage: 113 V

Current: 8.594 A

Power: 1010 W

Energy Consumption: 150 Wh

We used a power meter to measure the Dezin’s total energy consumption to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water to a rolling boil. The result was 150 Wh which was our standard for an 8/10 score.

### Noise Level

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/dezin-electric-glass-kettle-dz380-noise-level-clo5hkw5d0001e788eax1f1r3.jpg" alt="The Dezin Electric Glass Kettle DZ380 is boiling 1.5 liters of water. The noise meter displays the maximum sound pressure level to be 67.4 dB. The power meter reads 113 V, 8.954 A, 1.01 kW, 150 Wh, 50 Hz, and 1.0 PF." width="300px" height="200px">

Noise Level: 67.4 dB

During boiling, the Dezin’s noise level peaked at 67.4 dB while reaching a rolling simmer, which was significantly lower than the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hearing_loss/what_noises_cause_hearing_loss.html#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency,prevent%20noise%2Dinduced%20hearing%20loss.)\-recommended 80 dB. This result earned the kettle a whopping 9.3/10.

### Keep Warm

After 5 Minutes: 203°F / 94.5°C

Although the glass carafe of the Dezin doesn’t have the best property for heat retention, it was able to score a 7.5/10 in our Keep Warm test. After 5 minutes, the temperature only dropped from 212°F / 100°C to somewhere in between 203°F / 94.5°C and 204°F / 95°C. This score is quite good for a kettle that isn’t double-walled and doesn’t have the Keep Warm feature.

Design
------

design Scores: **5.9**

*   Carafe (50%) - **6.0**/10
    
*   Handle (10%) - **7.0**/10
    
*   Lid (20%) - **6.0**/10
    
*   Base (20%) - **5.0**/10
    

The Dezin Electric Glass Kettle is below average in terms of design. It still has some desirable features like water-level markings and an LED ring. However, the kettle cut some corners by having a make-shift filter and no cord storage or anti-slip pads for the base.

### In the Box

Length: 8.5" (21.6 cm)

Width: 5.9" (15.0 cm)

Height: 9.1" (23.0 cm)

### 6.0 - Carafe

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/dezin-electric-glass-kettle-dz380-carafe-clo5hrjed0005e7888vb3hbyq.jpg" alt="The carafe of the Dezin Electric Glass Kettle DZ380 sitting on top of its power base." width="300px" height="200px">

Capacity: 60.9 fl oz (1.8 L)

Weight: 1.8 lbs (0.8 kg)

Materials: Borosilicate glass

Spout: V-shaped

Opening Diameter: 3.54 in. (9 cm)

LED Ring: Blue

Filter: No

Water Level Markings: Yes

Tea Infuser: No

The carafe is made of glass and has a capacity of 1.8 L (60.87 fl. oz) or 7.5 cups of water (+2). It has a wide lid opening, 3.54 inches in diameter, allowing you to comfortably pour in water from your tap or any container (+1).

Similar to many other cordless electric kettles, the Dezin’s heating element is positioned inside the bottom of the carafe. There’s a ring of blue LED around the bottom which will illuminate when the kettle’s running, making it easy to spot in the dark (+2).

There are clear water level markings in the middle of the carafe (+1). The Dezin has quite a unique V-shaped spout that is shaped out of the glass carafe itself.

Usually, this means that the limescale filter will be fixed to the lid and the Dezin’s design stays true to that. However, this kettle only has a low-quality, plastic, holed filter which doesn't actually filter any limescale (+0). The only thing it does is restrict the water flow so that it doesn’t just gush out from the spout.

### 7.0 - Handle

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/dezin-electric-glass-kettle-dz380-handle-clo5htgwl0006e788htgjavh5.jpg" alt="A hand holding the Dezin Electric Glass Kettle DZ380 by its handle." width="300px" height="200px">

Materials: Cool-touch BPA-free plastic

Type: Cool-touch, anti-slip

The cool-touch handle is made of BPA-free plastic (+3). It doesn’t have an ergonomic contour or anti-slip feature, but feels secure and comfortable on the wrist nonetheless (+4). Quite different from other electric kettles, the power switch of this one is on its handle.

### 6.0 - Lid

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/dezin-electric-glass-kettle-dz380-lid-clo5hugui0007e788fzbs7ebv.jpg" alt="The stainless steel clip-lock lid of the Dezin Electric Glass Kettle DZ380." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/dezin-electric-glass-kettle-dz380-lid-1-clo5hvnvs0008e788ckrzes58.jpg" alt="A finger opening the clip-lock for the stainless steel lid of the Dezin Electric Glass Kettle DZ380." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/dezin-electric-glass-kettle-dz380-lid-2-clo5hxgab0009e7889c5q6p2i.jpg" alt="The clip-lock lid of the Dezin Electric Glass Kettle DZ380 opens at an 80° angle." width="300px" height="200px">

Materials: 340 stainless steel

Type: Hinged

Open Mechanism: Clip-lock

The Dezin has a hinged lid with a clip lock on top which isn’t as convenient as having a push button (+1). Nonetheless, the lid still opens to an 80° angle which is good enough to move out of the way to get water (+2).

The best thing about this lid is that it has a 340 stainless steel top and bottom (+2). This means there’s no plastic material coming into contact with your water, which we know many people appreciate. It isn’t entirely cool-touch though, only the clip.

Unlike some other electric kettles we’ve tested, this one doesn’t have a silicone band around the circumference. Regardless, the lid still closes tightly (+1).

### 5.0 - Base

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/top-power-base-dezin-electric-glass-kettle-dz380-clo5hybtb000ae7889pmvgsst.jpg" alt="The top of the power base of the Dezin Electric Glass Kettle DZ380." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/flat-bottom-power-base-dezin-electric-glass-kettle-dz380-clo5hzs6k000be7884g273c8f.jpg" alt="The flat bottom of the power base of the Dezin Electric Glass Kettle DZ380." width="300px" height="200px">

Materials: BPA-free plastic

Type: Swivel 360°

Cord Storage: Yes

The Dezin has a standard BPA-free plastic 360° swivel base that’s sturdy and fits the carafe well enough (+5). However, different from the majority of modern electric kettles, it doesn’t have cord storage or anti-slip rubber pads at the bottom of the base (+0).

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/three-pronged-round-power-cord-dezin-electric-glass-kettle-dz380-clo5i1alh000ce7885ohran43.jpg" alt="The three-pronged round power cord of the Dezin Electric Glass Kettle DZ380 is 21.46 inches long (54.5 cm)." width="300px" height="200px">

Type: three-pronged plug

Power: 1000 W

Rated Output: 120 V ~ 60 Hz

Cord Placement: Base

Cord Length: 21.46 in. (54.5 cm)

The Dezin has a 21.46 inch round power cord, which is a little bit short for our liking but should be enough for household use. It has a three-prong grounded plug which is typically safer than a two-pronged one.

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **6.6**

*   User Control (30%) - **7.0**/10
    
*   Ease of Use (50%) - **7.0**/10
    
*   Cleaning (20%) - **5.0**/10
    

The Dezin Electric Glass Kettle is overall easy to use and its clip-lock lid, though inconvenient, doesn’t pose any danger. However, due to the kettle not having a mesh filter, you’ll need to descale it more frequently, about once a week to ensure the kettle’s heating capability and its longevity.

### 7.0 - User Control

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/handle-dezin-electric-glass-kettle-dz380-has-power-switch-clo5i5opm000de788fj091wx8.jpg" alt="The handle of the Dezin Electric Glass Kettle DZ380 has a power switch." width="300px" height="200px">

Control: One touch

Indicator Light: No

Display: No

Temperature Control: No

Presets: No

Keep Warm: No

Automatic Shut-Off”: Yes

Boil-Dry Protection: Yes

The Dezin has a standard one-touch switch located on its handle with no digital display or temperature control (+1). This means the kettle doesn’t have an indicator light inside the switch like many of its peers. Thankfully, the carafe still has a blue LED ring to let you know the kettle is running (+2).

Like most other kettles, it has an automatic shutoff feature which activates when the thermal fuse detects that the ambient temperature is 100°C (+2). Keep in mind that this feature will not kick in if you leave the lid open. If you do, however, you still don’t have to worry about overheating because the kettle’s boil-dry protection feature will turn off the kettle when no water is present (+2).

### 7.0 - Ease of Use

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/hand-pouring-water-from-dezin-electric-glass-kettle-dz380-into-glass-black-tea-clo5jwro0000ee7884mvd8ztu.jpg" alt="A hand pouring water from the Dezin Electric Glass Kettle DZ380 into a glass of black tea" width="300px" height="200px">

The Dezin has a simple control but not the easiest to open due to the clip-lock lid mechanism (+2). Nonetheless, the lock is on top of the lid so opening it doesn’t risk scalding ourselves.

The unobstructed and large opening of 3.54 inches allowed us to comfortably pour in water from the tap or any container (+1). There are water level markings in the middle of the carafe for easy viewing and precise decanting (+1). We found no odd odor during the first boil—a sign of good material quality and upkeep before delivery.

The handle felt good in the hand and seemed sturdy when we picked the kettle up—it was filled with water to the max (+1). The nice angle between the arm and the kettle made pouring effortless (+1).

The power base fits firmly below its carafe so there is no wobbling around during boiling (+1). However, there’s no cord storage for cable management (+0).

### 5.0 - Cleaning

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/dezin-electric-glass-kettle-dz380-cleaning-clo5jz6kc000fe788ckky0h6j.jpg" alt="A person in a white shirt holding the Zeppoli Electric Kettle ZPL-KETTLE by its handle on one hand and the other hand wiping the carafe interior with a piece of tissue. On the right is a bottle of white vinegar." width="300px" height="200px">

Cleaning the Dezin is very straightforward and we recommend doing it weekly, especially on the inside as the kettle doesn’t have a limescale mesh filter (+2). To remove the limescale, simply boil a mixture of vinegar and water and rinse the kettle afterward.

As for the kettle, its lid opening is large enough for an adult hand to fit through and wipe the interior when necessary (+3).
