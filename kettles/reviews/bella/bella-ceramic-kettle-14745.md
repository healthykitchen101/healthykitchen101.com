Our overall verdict for the Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle did not disappoint on  our first impressions. We really like the ceramic carafe and gooseneck spout of the kettle, enough to overlook its relatively slow boiling time.

We were hoping to recommend this kettle for our senior tea enthusiasts.  Being a little on the heavier side with a tight lid soon, we soon scuttled that idea. However, it’s simple to use, easy to clean, and pours nicely enough for that nice cuppa.

**Things We Like**

*   Attractive design
*   Gooseneck spout for tea
*   Rare ceramic carafe
*   Well-priced
*   Tight lid

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Slightly heavy
*   No filter
*   Loose cord wrap
*   No water-level markings

Another contestant in our electric kettle series is the Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle 14745 and we bought it for $42.35. We chose the black floral pattern, but this 1.5-liter ceramic model also comes in blue Aztec and silver tile.

The Bella Kettle caught our eye with its attractive design. The kettle’s rare ceramic carafe and gooseneck spout seemed  a great choice for  afternoon tea. Our tests proved the boiling time to be a little slow, but there are other pros and cons you may want to consider.

The Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle showed a good performance all things considered. Its boiling time was a bit slow, but otherwise energy consumption and noise levels were average. Unfortunately, our high hopes in the heat retention department were dashed because the material of design failed to deliver.

### Boiling Time

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/bella-ceramic-kettle-14745-boiling-time-clniaikeu000118880zepcy8y.jpg" alt="1.5 liter of water boiling inside the Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle (14745). The digital timer displays 8 minutes and 14 seconds." width="300px" height="200px">

Room Temperature: 80°F / 26.7°C

Water Volume: 1.5 liters

Boiling Time: 8m 14s

Although the Bella has a gooseneck spout, it still has the same capacity as the common electric kettle. Thus, we still evaluate the time it takes to boil 1.5 liters of water. The product took 8 minutes and 14 seconds to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water (80°F/26.7°C) to boiling point (212°F/100°C).

White this result wasn’t very fast, it was actually quite good for the kettle’s 1350 W of power. Compared to all of our tested kettles, it deserved a 6.8/10.

### Energy Consumption

Voltage: 113 V

Current: 10.25 A

Power: 1160 W

Energy Consumption: 158 W

We used a power meter to measure the Bella’s total energy consumption to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water to a rolling boil. The result was 158 Wh which was our standard for a 6.4/10.

### Noise Level

The noise meter displays the maximum sound pressure level to be 73.1 dB. The power meter reads 113 V, 10.25 A, 1.16 kW, 1.58 Wh, 50 Hz, and 1.0 PF." width="300px" height="200px">

Noise Level: 73.1 dB

During boiling, the Bella’s noise level peaked at 73.1 dB while reaching a rolling simmer, which was lower than the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hearing_loss/what_noises_cause_hearing_loss.html#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency,prevent%20noise%2Dinduced%20hearing%20loss.)\-recommended 80 dB. This result earned the kettle an 8.7/10.

### Keep Warm

In the middle is the Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle (14745) with 1.5 liters of water and two probes inside. On the right is a digital timer displaying 5 minutes on the countdown." width="300px" height="200px">

After 5 Minutes: 202°F / 95°C

Before going into the test, we had hoped the Bella’s ceramic carafe would be able retain the heat better than glass or plastic. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case.

The result showed that, after 5 minutes, the temperature dropped from 212°F / 100°C to 202°F / 95°C. This equates to a 7/10 according to our data.

The kettle also doesn’t have temperature control for the Keep Warm feature.

Design
------

design Scores: **5.8**

*   Carafe (50%) - **5.0**/10
    
*   Handle (10%) - **7.0**/10
    
*   Lid (20%) - **7.0**/10
    
*   Base (20%) - **6.0**/10
    

The Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle has an aesthetically pleasing design encompassing its practical gooseneck spout. However, its ceramic carafe prevented it from having an LED ring to be seen in the dark and a mesh filter to remove limescale effectively. The kettle also cut some corners with the quality of its base.

### In the Box

*   One corded power base
*   One user manual
*   Warranty: 2-year limited

The Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle arrived between two foam pads on the top and the bottom inside a carton box. The instruction manual came in English and Spanish. It was quite detailed with information on the kettle’s parts, how to use, safeguards, cleaning and maintaining, troubleshooting, and warranty.

Capacity: 50.7 fl oz (1.5 L)

Weight: 3.6 lbs (1.7 kg)

Materials: Ceramic

Spout: Gooseneck

Opening Diameter: 3.7" (9.5 cm)

LED Ring: No

Filter: Built-in holes

Water Level Markings: No

Tea Infuser: No

The Bella Kettle’s entire carafe, including its gooseneck and lid, is made of ceramic (+2). Its capacity is 1.5 L, or 50.72 fl. oz., or 6 cups of water, which is on the smaller side of this line of product.

The carafe has a large opening, 3.74 inches in diameter, allowing you to comfortably pour in water from your tap or any container (+1). Unfortunately, the kettle doesn’t have a limescale mesh filter or a water level window, only a maximum water level indicator at the top of the heating element (+2).

An interesting design choice of this model is that its heating element extends from inside the carafe’s bottom to near the top of the carafe’s interior. We assume this is the reason why the kettle's boiling time is slightly faster than other models with the same power output.

### 7.0 - Handle

Materials: Ceramic

Type: Cool-touch

The handle is also ceramic and is designed to be cool-touch (+3). It doesn’t have an anti-slip feature but feels secure and comfortable on the write nonetheless (+4).

### 7.0 - Lid

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/bella-ceramic-kettle-14745-lid-clniawzh1000f18885s5bhm5s.jpg" alt="A hand holding the lid of the Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle (14745)." width="300px" height="200px">

Materials: Ceramic

Type: Removable

Open Mechanism: Remove by hand

This lid doesn’t have a hinge, you have to grab its handle and remove it by hand. It has a silicone band around the circumference to make sure it’s tightly sealed when closed.

### 6.0 - Base

Materials: BPA-free plastic

Type: Swivel 360°

Cord Storage: Yes

The Bella has a standard BPA-free plastic 360° swivel base (+2). At the bottom of the base is the cord storage and also three small anti-slip rubber pads (+4). We found that the base fit well enough but its plastic is a bit too thin to feel sturdy enough for such a heavy kettle (+0).

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/bella-ceramic-kettle-14745-power-cord-clniazejc000i18887gdfc8id.jpg" alt="The three-pronged cord of the Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle (14745) is 32.67 inches or 83 cm." width="300px" height="200px">

Type: three-pronged plug

Power: 1350 W

Rated Output: 120 V ~ 60 Hz

Cord Placement: Base

Cord Length: 32.7" (83.0 cm)

The Bella has a 32.67-inch flat power cord, which should be plenty enough for household use. Its three-pronged plug is typically safer than a two-pronged one by having a grounding wire.

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **5.7**

*   User Control (30%) - **6.0**/10
    
*   Ease of Use (50%) - **5.0**/10
    
*   Cleaning (20%) - **7.0**/10
    

The limited design features of the Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle also affected its usability. This is exacerbated by the heavy carafe and its smooth handle without any extra grip. The silver lining here is that the kettle is very easy to clean.

### 6.0 - User Control

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/bella-ceramic-kettle-14745-user-control-clnib0ksr000j1888exa851mr.jpg" alt="The clear plastic power switch of the Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle (14745)." width="300px" height="200px">

Control: One touch

Indicator Light: Blue LED

Display: No

Temperature Control: No

Presets: No

Keep Warm: No

Automatic Shut-Off”: Yes

Boil-Dry Protection: Yes

The Bella has a standard one-touch switch with no digital display or temperature control. (+1)

The power switch is made of clear plastic and is positioned at the base of the carafe along the handle. It also acts as the indicator light which will illuminate with a blue LED when the kettle is running (+1). However, the light isn’t the brightest, so it may not be very easy to spot in the dark.

The kettle has an automatic shutoff feature which will activate when the thermo fuse detects that the temperature has reached boiling point (+2). Keep in mind that this feature will not kick in if you leave the lid open. If you do, however, you still don’t have to worry about overheating because the kettle’s boil-dry protection feature will turn off the kettle when no water is present (+2).

### 5.0 - Ease of Use

This Bella ceramic kettle is quite heavy compared to glass and even stainless steel (-1). However, the material means there’s no plastic coming into contact with your water—something many people appreciate (+1). Evidently, we noticed no odd odor during our first boil or any subsequent one.

Having only the power switch, the Bella is as easy to use as it can be (+2). The large opening of 3.74 inches allowed us to comfortably pour in water from the tap or any container (+1). Thanks to its gooseneck spout, the arm-to-kettle pouring angle is very precise, especially when you’re trying to steep your tea (+1).

The carafe doesn’t have a water level window, only markings on the inside which can be quite tricky to get the exact volume of water you desire. Nonetheless, it should not be too much of a problem as long as you keep the water level below maximum (+0).

The handle feels good in the hand and seems sturdy when we pick the kettle up, including when it’s filled with water to the max (+2). However, be careful and make sure your hand isn’t wet when handling the kettle because its polished surface is very smooth throughout (-1).

This old-school lid may require a bit of force though to remove due to how tightly it closes (+0). We think this feature is good for minimizing heat loss but can be cumbersome for seniors to use. You don’t have to worry about accidentally scalding yourself, however, as long as you hold the lid by its handle and don’t touch the flat surface.

The power base fits below its carafe so the entire thing doesn’t wobble around during boiling but it doesn’t have the sturdiest structure (+0). Due to the flat shape of the cord, it was impossible for us to wrap it tightly around storage (+0). After wrapping, the cord still stuck out quite a bit—10 inches, including the plug.

### 7.0 - Cleaning

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/bella-ceramic-kettle-14745-cleaning-clnib821o000k1888c2xh9o9s.jpg" alt="A hand holding a blue cloth wiping the interior of the Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle (14745)." width="300px" height="200px">

Wiping the interior of the Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle 14745.

Cleaning the Bella is very straightforward and we recommend doing it weekly, especially on the inside as the kettle doesn’t have a limescale mesh filter (+3). In addition to the lid being removable, the opening is large enough for an adult hand to fit through and wipe the interior when necessary (+4).
