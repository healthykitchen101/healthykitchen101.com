Our overall verdict for the Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle did not disappoint on  our first impressions. We really like the ceramic carafe and gooseneck spout of the kettle, enough to overlook its relatively slow boiling time.

We were hoping to recommend this kettle for our senior tea enthusiasts. Seeing that the kettle was a little on the heavier side with a tight lid, we soon scuttled that idea. However, it’s simple to use, easy to clean, and pours nicely enough for that nice cuppa.

**Things We Like**

*   Attractive design
*   Gooseneck spout for tea
*   Rare ceramic carafe
*   Well-priced
*   Tight lid

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Slightly heavy
*   No filter
*   Loose cord wrap
*   No water-level markings

Another contestant in our electric kettle series is the Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle 14745 and we bought it for $42.35. We chose the black floral pattern, but this 1.5-liter ceramic model also comes in blue Aztec and silver tile.

The Bella Kettle caught our eye with its attractive design. The kettle’s rare ceramic carafe and gooseneck spout seemed  a great choice for  afternoon tea. Our tests proved the boiling time to be a little slow, but there are other pros and cons you may want to consider.

The Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle showed a good performance all things considered. Its boiling time was a bit slow, but otherwise energy consumption and noise levels were average. Unfortunately, our high hopes in the heat retention department were dashed because the material of design failed to deliver.

### Boiling Time

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/bella-ceramic-kettle-14745-boiling-time-clniaikeu000118880zepcy8y.jpg" alt="1.5 liter of water boiling inside the Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle (14745). The digital timer displays 8 minutes and 14 seconds." width="300px" height="200px">

Room Temperature: 80°F (26.7°C)

Water Volume: 50.72 fl. oz. (1.5 liters)

Boiling Time: 8m 14s

Although the Bella has a gooseneck spout, it still has the same capacity as the common electric kettle. Thus, we still evaluate the time it takes to boil 1.5 liters of water as per a standard kettle. The kettle took 8 minutes and 14 seconds to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water (80°F/26.7°C) to boiling point (212°F/100°C).

White this result wasn’t very fast, it was actually quite good for the kettle’s 1350 W of power whereas most other kettles tend to have 1500 W or more. Compared to all of our tested kettles, it deserved a 6.8/10 score.

### Energy Consumption

Voltage: 113 V

Current: 10.25 A

Power: 1160 W

Energy Consumption: 158 W

We used a power meter to measure the Bella’s total energy consumption bringing 1.5 liters of room-temperature water to a rolling boil. The result was 158 Wh which was our standard for a 6.4/10.

### Noise Level

The noise meter displays the maximum sound pressure level to be 73.1 dB. The power meter reads 113 V, 10.25 A, 1.16 kW, 1.58 Wh, 50 Hz, and 1.0 PF." width="300px" height="200px">

Noise Level: 73.1 dB

The Bella’s noise level peaked at 73.1 dB while reaching a rolling simmer. According to the  [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hearing_loss/what_noises_cause_hearing_loss.html#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency,prevent%20noise%2Dinduced%20hearing%20loss.), 80 dB for a duration of 2 hours is a threshold level, so there is not much to worry about. This result earned the kettle an 8.7/10.

### Keep Warm

In the middle is the Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle (14745) with 1.5 liters of water and two probes inside. On the right is a digital timer displaying 5 minutes on the countdown." width="300px" height="200px">

After 5 Minutes: 202°F / 95°C

Before actual testing, we had hoped the Bella’s ceramic carafe would be able retain heat better than glass or plastic. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case.

The result showed that, after 5 minutes, the temperature dropped from 212°F / 100°C to 202°F / 95°C. This equates to a 7/10 according to our scoring benchmark.

It’s worth noting that this kettle also doesn’t have temperature control for the Keep Warm feature, and simply switches off after boiling.

The Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle has an aesthetically pleasing design encompassing its practical gooseneck spout. However, due to the  ceramic material there is no LED ring to light things up  in the dark nor is there a mesh filter to remove limescale. The kettle also cut some corners with the quality of its base.

### In the Box

The Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle arrived boxed in between a foam pad   on the top and the bottom. The instruction manual came in English and Spanish. It was quite detailed with information on the kettle’s parts, user instructions, safeguards, cleaning and maintenance, troubleshooting, and a warranty.

Capacity: 50.7 fl oz (1.5 L)

Weight: 3.6 lbs (1.7 kg)

Materials: Ceramic

Spout: Gooseneck

Opening Diameter: 3.7" (9.5 cm)

LED Ring: No

Filter: Built-in holes

Water Level Markings: No

Tea Infuser: No

The Bella Kettle’s entire carafe, including its gooseneck and lid, is made of ceramic (+2). Its capacity is 1.5 L, or 50.72 fl. oz., or 6 cups of water, which is somewhat smaller than your average household electric kettle. 

The carafe has a large opening, 3.74 inches in diameter, allowing you to comfortably pour in water from your tap or any container (+1). Unfortunately, the kettle doesn’t have a limescale mesh filter or a water level window, only a maximum water level indicator at the top of the heating element (+2).

An interesting design choice of this model is that its heating element extends from inside the carafe’s bottom to near the top of the carafe’s interior. We assume this is the reason why the kettle's boiling time is slightly faster than other models with the same 1350 W power output.

### 7.0 - Handle

Materials: Ceramic

Type: Cool-touch

The handle is also ceramic and is designed to be cool-to-touch (+3). It doesn’t have an anti-slip feature but feels secure and comfortable on the wrist nonetheless (+4).

### 7.0 - Lid

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/bella-ceramic-kettle-14745-lid-clniawzh1000f18885s5bhm5s.jpg" alt="A hand holding the lid of the Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle (14745)." width="300px" height="200px">

Materials: Ceramic

Type: Removable

Open Mechanism: Remove by hand

This lid doesn’t have a hinge, you have to completely remove the handle by hand. It has a silicone band around the circumference to make sure it’s tightly sealed when closed.

### 6.0 - Base

Materials: BPA-free plastic

Type: Swivel 360°

Cord Storage: Yes

The Bella has a standard BPA-free plastic 360° swivel base (+2). At the bottom of the base is the cord storage and also three small anti-slip rubber pads (+4). Although the carafe fitted well to the base, the plastic is a bit too thin to feel sturdy enough for such a heavy kettle (+0).

### Power Cord

Type: three-pronged plug

Power: 1350 W

Rated Output: 120 V ~ 60 Hz

Cord Placement: Base

Cord Length: 32.7" (83.0 cm)

The Bella has a 32.67-inch flat power cord, which should be plenty enough for household use. Its three-pronged plug with a grounding wire is typically safer than a two-pronged one.

Reflecting the nature and limitations of its design, the Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle did not do so well in terms of its user-friendliness. Key issues were the heavy carafe and its smooth handle lacking additional grip. The silver lining is perhaps how easy it is to clean.

### 6.0 - User Control

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/bella-ceramic-kettle-14745-user-control-clnib0ksr000j1888exa851mr.jpg" alt="The clear plastic power switch of the Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle (14745)." width="300px" height="200px">

Control: One touch

Indicator Light: Blue LED

Display: No

Temperature Control: No

Presets: No

Keep Warm: No

Automatic Shut-Off: Yes

Boil-Dry Protection: Yes

The Bella has a standard one-touch switch with no digital display or temperature control. (+1)

The power switch is made of clear plastic and is positioned at the base of the carafe along the handle. It also acts as the indicator light which will illuminate with a blue LED when the kettle is running (+1). However, the light isn’t the brightest, so it may not be very easy to spot in the dark.

The kettle has an automatic shutoff feature which will activate when the thermo fuse detects that the temperature has reached boiling point (+2). If you leave the lid off, this feature will not work, but there is also an overheating and dry-boil protection feature. (+2).

### 5.0 - Ease of Use

This Bella ceramic kettle is quite heavy compared to glass and even stainless steel (-1). However, ceramics means no plastic coming into contact with your water—something many people appreciate (+1). Evidently, we noticed no odd odor during our first boil or thereafter.

Having only the power switch, the Bella is as easy to use as it can be (+2). The large opening of 3.74 inches allowed us to comfortably pour in water from the tap or any container (+1).

Thanks to its gooseneck spout, the arm-to-kettle pouring angle is very precise (+1). This means if you’re steeping tea leaf directly inside the kettle, it’s easy to pour straight off the top. 

The carafe doesn’t have a water level window, only markings on the inside which can be quite tricky if you need an exact measurement of water. Nonetheless, it shouldn’t be a problem as long as you keep the water level below maximum (+0).

The handle feels good to grip and seemed sturdy when we picked the kettle up, including when it was filled to the max (+2). However, be mindful if your hands are wet because its polished surface is very smooth (-1).

This old-school lid may require a bit of force though to remove due to how tightly it closes (+0). We think this feature is good for minimizing heat loss but can be cumbersome for seniors to use. You don’t have to worry about accidentally scalding yourself, however, as long as you hold the lid by its nob and don’t touch the flat surface.

The carafe fits neatly onto the power base and  doesn’t wobble during boiling but it’s not the sturdiest of structures (+0). Due to the flat shape of the cord, it was difficult to wrap it tightly around storage (+0). After wrapping, the cord still stuck out quite a bit—10 inches, including the plug.

### 7.0 - Cleaning

Wiping the interior of the Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle 14745.

Cleaning the Bella is very straightforward and we recommend doing it weekly, especially on the inside as the kettle doesn’t have a limescale mesh filter (+3). In addition to the removable lid , the opening is large enough for an adult hand to fit through and easily wipe the interior(+4).
