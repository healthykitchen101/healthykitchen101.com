A somewhat unique point of the Cosori Original Electric Glass Kettle is zero contact of hot water to plastic. This is due to stainless steel on the under part of the lid in addition to a completely glass carafe. The carafe itself also stands out for its large and unobstructed opening, ideal for easy cleaning and filling.

The icing on the cake is a comparatively fast and very quiet boiling phase. On the other hand, this kettle did consume more energy than its counterparts but overall performance was great.

**Things We Like**

*   Glass spout
*   Stainless steel under lid
*   Large opening
*   Quiet when boiling
*   Easy to use
*   Light weight

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   High energy consumption
*   Cord doesn’t fit storage

We bought the Cosori Original Electric Glass Kettle (GK172-CO) for $27.99 on Amazon.  It has a large glass carafe, slightly rigid lid, and we were most impressed with the fast boiling time. Read about other pros and cons, view original pics, and find out if this kettle lived up to our high hopes.

On a side note, beside the black handle, glass carafe, and mesh filter version that we got, there’s a white-handle version as well. There’s also a stainless steel carafe model without a mesh filter.

The Cosori Original Electric Glass Kettle has a pretty fast and very quiet boiling phase, which is something everyone can appreciate. However, heat retention was only average and its energy consumption was significantly higher than many other kettles with the same power draw.

### Boiling Time

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/cosori-glass-electric-kettle-gk172-co-boiling-time-cllentgce0001zb88gcy8hcv5.jpg" alt="1.5 liter of water boiling inside the Cosori Glass Electric Kettle (GK172-CO). The digital timer displays 7 minutes and 1 seconds." width="300px" height="200px">

Room Temperature: 80°F

Water Volume: 1.5 liters

Boiling Time: 7m 1s

For the common electric kettles (not goosenecks) like the Cosori, we evaluate the time they take to boil 1.5 liters of water—a middle ground of their capacity. This kettle took 7 minutes and 1 seconds to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water (80°F/26.7°C) to boiling point (212°F/100°C).

This result was quite fast and matched other kettle’s with 1500 W of power, so it was worthy of a 8/10 score. Moreover, it matched with the manufacturer’s advertised [British STRIX Tech](https://strix.com/our-technology-strix.html) claiming boiling times from 3 to 7 minutes.

### Energy Consumption

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/cosori-glass-electric-kettle-gk172-co-energy-consumption-clleo530p0002zb888xe61os9.jpg" alt="The power meter reads the energy consumption of the Cosori Glass Electric Kettle (GK172-CO) to be 161 Wh." width="300px" height="200px">

Voltage: 114 V

Current: 12.12 A

Power: 1370 W

Energy Consumption: 161 Wh

We used a power meter to measure the Cosori’ total energy consumption. It took 161 Wh to bring 1.5 liters of room temperature water to a rolling boil. Compared to our data from other kettles, this was quite high and deserved only a 5.8/10.

### Noise Level

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/cosori-glass-electric-kettle-gk172-co-noise-level-clleo6dw30003zb88c2v81gon.jpg" alt="The Cosori Glass Electric Kettle (GK172-CO) is boiling 1.5 liters of water. The noise meter displays the maximum sound pressure level to be 70.4 dB. The power meter reads 114 V, 12.12 A, 1.37 kW, 0.63 Wh, 50 Hz, and 1.0 PF." width="300px" height="200px">

Noise Level: 70.4 dB

During boiling, the Cosori’s noise level peaked at 70.4 dB while reaching a rolling simmer, which was much quieter than the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hearing_loss/what_noises_cause_hearing_loss.html#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency,prevent%20noise%2Dinduced%20hearing%20loss.)’s safe level of exposure to 80 dB for 2 hours. By comparison to many other kettles, this was really quiet and earned a whopping 9/10.

### Keep Warm

On the right is a digital timer displaying 5 minutes on the countdown." width="300px" height="200px">

After 5 Minutes: 201°F / 94.5°C

The glass carafe of the Cosori isn’t the best material for heat retention. The kettle also doesn’t have temperature control or a  Keep Warm feature. As a result, after 5 minutes, the temperature dropped from 212°F / 100°C to 201°F / 94.5°C. This was average among our tested kettles and equated to a 6.5/10 according to our data.

The Cosori Original Electric Glass Kettle has some interesting tweaks to an otherwise standard design. Most notably, its spout is shaped out of the glass carafe and the underside of the lid is stainless steel—meaning absolutely no contact with hot water and plastic.

It has overall good build quality and sports a typical mesh filter, a blue LED ring, a large opening, and a pop-up lid.

Capacity: 57.5 fl oz (1.7 L)

Weight: 2.1 oz (59 g)

Materials: Borosilicate glass

Spout: V-shaped

Opening Diameter: 4.3" (11.0 cm)

LED Ring: Blue

Filter: Removable mesh

Water Level Markings: Yes

Tea Infuser: No

The borosilicate glass carafe holds a maximum of 1.7 L (57.48 fl. oz), which is about 7 cups (+2). It has a large opening, 4.33 inches (11 cm) in diameter, allowing you to comfortably pour in water from your tap or any container (+1).

There are water level markings in the middle of the carafe (+1). The Cosori has  a  V-shaped spout that is shaped out of the glass carafe itself. As a result, the limescale filter doesn’t attach to the spout like other kettles but is positioned by the lid and is undetachable (+1). The filter is screw-on, however, so you can still remove it.

Similar to many other cordless electric kettles, the Cosori’s heating element is positioned inside the bottom of the carafe. There’s a ring of blue LED around the bottom which will illuminate when the kettle’s running, making it easy to spot in the dark (+2).

### 7.0 - Handle

Materials: Cool-touch BPA-free plastic

Type: Cool-touch, anti-slip

The cool-touch handle is made of BPA-free plastic (+3). Its design is standard, without an ergonomic contour or anti-slip feature, but feels secure and comfortable on the wrist nonetheless (+4).

### 8.0 - Lid

Materials: 304 stainless steel

Type: Hinged

Open Mechanism: Push-button

The Cosori has a hinged lid that pop-ups to an 80° angle with a single push of a button on the handle (+4). This angle is wide enough to easily pour in water even with the fixed filter attachment (+2).

The lid has a plastic rim but a stainless steel top and bottom. This means there’s no contact between plastic and hot water, which we know many people will appreciate. However, only the small black area of the lid is cool-to-touch, so you should take care.

Unlike many other electric kettles we’ve tested, this one doesn’t have a silicone band around the circumference. Regardless, the lid still closes tightly (+1).

### 9.0 - Base

Materials: BPA-free plastic

Type:  Swivel 360°

Cord Storage: Yes

The Cosori has a standard BPA-free plastic 360° swivel base that’s sturdy and fits the carafe well (+5). At the bottom of the base is the cord storage and also three small anti-slip rubber pads (+4).

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/cosori-glass-electric-kettle-gk172-co-power-cord-clleu1lk0000kzb88h2613kcu.jpg" alt="The two-pronged plug of the Cosori Glass Electric Kettle (GK172-CO)." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/cosori-glass-electric-kettle-gk172-co-power-cord-1-clleywajs000lzb888yfm85ad.jpg" alt="The power cord of the Cosori Glass Electric Kettle (GK172-CO) is 29.53 inches in length." width="300px" height="200px">

Type: three-pronged plug

Power: 1500 W

Rated Output: 120 V ~ 60 Hz

Cord Placement: Base

Cord Length: 29.5" (75.0 cm)

The Cosori has a 29.53 inch flat power cord, which should be plenty enough for household use. Its three-pronged plug is typically safer than a two-pronged one by having a grounding wire.

Usability

The Cosori Original Electric Glass Kettle has a slightly higher usability than its peers mostly thanks to the structure of its entire carafe. Its large and unobstructed opening made it easier to fill water and clean afterward. Other than that, the kettle was easy to use, carry, and pour to an acceptable standard. If only we could wrap the cord neatly around its storage.

### 7.0 - User Control

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/cosori-glass-electric-kettle-gk172-co-user-control-clletu2ml000fzb88ab2yfe3c.jpg" alt="The clear plastic power switch of the Cosori Glass Electric Kettle (GK172-CO)." width="300px" height="200px">

Control: One touch

Indicator Light: Blue LED

Display: No

Temperature Control: No

Presets: 5

Keep Warm: 30 minutes

Automatic Shut-Off: Yes

Boil-Dry Protection: Yes

The Cosori has a standard one-touch switch with no digital display or temperature control (+1).

The power switch is made of clear plastic and is positioned near the bottom of the carafe along the handle. It also acts as the indicator light which will illuminate with a blue LED when the kettle is running (+2).

The kettle has an automatic shutoff feature which will activate when the thermo fuse detects that the temperature has reached boiling point (+2). Keep in mind that this feature will not kick in if you leave the lid open. If you do, however, you still don’t have to worry about overheating because the kettle’s boil-dry protection feature will turn off the kettle when no water is present (+2).

### 8.0 - Ease of Use

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/cosori-glass-electric-kettle-gk172-co-ease-use-clletwo4c000gzb88fsor7ubj.jpg" alt="A person in a grey shirt pouring water from the Cosori Glass Electric Kettle (GK172-CO) into a glass." width="300px" height="200px">

The Cosori is extremely simple to use, with only two distinctive buttons—one for power and one for opening the lid (+2). We also found no odd odor during the first boil, a sign of good material quality and upkeep before delivery.

The carafe felt very light when we picked it up—it’s only slightly more than 2 lbs (+2). Holding its handle felt good in the hand and was sturdy enough to be carried around when filled with water to the max. The pouring angle between the arm and the kettle was good as well, making the action effortless (+1).

The large opening of 4.33 inches allowed us to comfortably pour in water from the tap or any container (+1). The water level markings are in the middle of the carafe for easy viewing and precise decanting (+1).

The power base fits firmly below its carafe so the entire thing doesn’t wobble around during boiling (+1). Due to the flat shape of the cord, it was impossible for us to wrap it tightly around storage. After wrapping, the cord still stuck out quite a bit—6.3 inches, including the plug.

### 7.0 - Cleaning
