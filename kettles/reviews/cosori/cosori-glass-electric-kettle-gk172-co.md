From a user perspective, the main selling point of the Cosori Original Electric Glass Kettle to us is the fact that there’s no plastic coming into contact with the water. And of course, we have the kettle’s glass carafe and spout as well as its stainless steel inner lid to thank for that. Speaking of which, the carafe also stands out quite a bit with its large and unobstructed opening for easy cleaning and filling.

A relatively fast and highly quiet boiling phase is just the icing on the cake in this case. It does consume more energy than its peers but still has a great performance score nonetheless.

**Things We Like**

*   Glass spout
*   Stainless steel inner lid
*   Large and unobstructed opening
*   Quiet when boiling
*   Easy to use
*   Light weight

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   High energy consumption
*   Cord doesn’t fit storage

The next contender to be in our toplist of the best electric kettles is the Cosori Original Electric Glass Kettle (GK172-CO) that we bought for $28.65 on Amazon. Our first impression of it was a large glass carafe, slightly rigid lid, and fast boiling time. We had some pretty high hopes for this one.

On a side note, beside the black handle, glass carafe, and mesh filter version that we got, there’s a white-handle version as well. There’s also a stainless steel carafe model without a mesh filter.

The Cosori Original Electric Glass Kettle has a pretty fast and very quiet boiling phase, which is great for its performance. However, its ability to keep warm is only average and its energy consumption is significantly higher than many other products with the same power draw.

### Boiling Time

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/cosori-glass-electric-kettle-gk172-co-boiling-time-cllentgce0001zb88gcy8hcv5.jpg" alt="1.5 liter of water boiling inside the Cosori Glass Electric Kettle (GK172-CO). The digital timer displays 7 minutes and 1 seconds." width="300px" height="200px">

Room Temperature: 80°F

Water Volume: 1.5 liters

Boiling Time: 7m 1s

For the common electric kettles (not gooseneck) like the Cosori, we evaluate the time they take to boil 1.5 liters of water—a middle ground of their capacity. The product took 7 minutes and 1 seconds to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water (80°F/26.7°C) to boiling point (212°F/100°C).

This result was quite fast and matched with the kettle’s 1500 W of power, worthy of a 8/10. Moreover, it matched with the manufacturer’s advertised [British STRIX Tech](https://strix.com/our-technology-strix.html) claiming their boiling times ranged from 3-7 minutes.

### Energy Consumption

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/cosori-glass-electric-kettle-gk172-co-energy-consumption-clleo530p0002zb888xe61os9.jpg" alt="The power meter reads the energy consumption of the Cosori Glass Electric Kettle (GK172-CO) to be 161 Wh." width="300px" height="200px">

Voltage: 114 V

Current: 12.12 A

Power: 1370 W

Energy Consumption: 161 Wh

We used a power meter to measure the Cosori’ total energy consumption to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water to a rolling boil. The resulting 161 Wh indicated quite a lot of energy consumed for the task of boiling water. Compared to other kettles in our data, this one deserved only a 5.8/10.

### Noise Level

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/cosori-glass-electric-kettle-gk172-co-noise-level-clleo6dw30003zb88c2v81gon.jpg" alt="The Cosori Glass Electric Kettle (GK172-CO) is boiling 1.5 liters of water. The noise meter displays the maximum sound pressure level to be 70.4 dB. The power meter reads 114 V, 12.12 A, 1.37 kW, 0.63 Wh, 50 Hz, and 1.0 PF." width="300px" height="200px">

Noise Level: 70.4 dB

During boiling, the Cosori’s noise level peaked at 70.4 dB while reaching a rolling simmer, which was much quieter than the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hearing_loss/what_noises_cause_hearing_loss.html#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency,prevent%20noise%2Dinduced%20hearing%20loss.)\-recommended 80 dB. This result earned the kettle a whopping 9/10 from our line-up.

### Keep Warm

On the right is a digital timer displaying 5 minutes on the countdown." width="300px" height="200px">

After 5 Minutes: 201°F / 94.5°C

The glass carafe of the Cosori doesn’t have the best material for heat retention. The kettle also doesn’t have temperature control for the Keep Warm feature. As a result, after 5 minutes, the temperature dropped from 212°F / 100°C to 201°F / 94.5°C. This was average among our tested kettles and equated to a 6.5/10 according to our data.

Design
------

design Scores: **7.6**

*   Carafe (50%) - **7.0**/10
    
*   Handle (10%) - **7.0**/10
    
*   Lid (20%) - **8.0**/10
    
*   Base (20%) - **9.0**/10
    

The Cosori Original Electric Glass Kettle has some interesting tweaks on an otherwise pretty standard design. Most notably, its spout is shaped out of the glass carafe and the inner lid is stainless steel—meaning absolutely no plastic is coming into contact with the water.

In addition, the kettle’s overall build quality is quite high. This can be seen through all of its desirable features for an electric kettle, like a mesh filter, a blue LED ring, a large opening, and a pop-up lid.

Capacity: 57.5 fl oz (1.7 L)

Weight: 2.1 oz (59 g)

Materials: Borosilicate glass

Spout: V-shaped

Opening Diameter: 4.3" (11.0 cm)

LED Ring: Blue

Filter: Removable mesh

Water Level Markings: Yes

Tea Infuser: No

The carafe is made of glass and has a capacity of 1.7 L, 57.48 fl. oz, or 7 cups (+2). It has a large opening, 4.33 inches in diameter, allowing you to comfortably pour in water from your tap or any container (+1).

There are water level markings in the middle of the carafe (+1). The Cosori has quite a unique V-shaped spout that is shaped out of the glass carafe itself. As a result, the limescale filter can’t be attached to the spout like other kettles but is positioned by the lid and is unremovable (+1).

Similar to many other cordless electric kettles, the Cosori’ heating element is positioned inside the bottom of the carafe. There’s a ring of blue LED around the bottom which will illuminate when the kettle’s running, making it easy to spot in the dark (+2).

### 7.0 - Handle

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/cosori-glass-electric-kettle-gk172-co-handle-clletza9r000izb88adru4rks.jpg" alt="A hand holding the Cosori Glass Electric Kettle (GK172-CO)  by its handle." width="300px" height="200px">

Materials: Cool-touch BPA-free plastic

Type: Cool-touch, anti-slip

The cool-touch handle is made of BPA-free plastic (+3). Its design is standard, without an ergonomic contour or anti-slip feature, but feels secure and comfortable on the wrist nonetheless (+4).

### 8.0 - Lid

Materials: 304 stainless steel

Type: Hinged

Open Mechanism: Push-button

The Cosori has a hinged lid that pop-ups to an 80° angle with a single push of a button located on the handle (+4). That angle is more than enough for the lid to move out of the way to get water in despite its fixed filter (+2).

The lid has a plastic rim but a stainless steel top and bottom. This means there’s no plastic material coming into contact with your water, which we know many people appreciate. It isn’t entirely cool-touch though, only a small black area.

Unlike many other electric kettles we’ve tested, this one doesn’t have a silicone band around the circumference. Nonetheless, the lid still closes tightly (+1).

### 9.0 - Base

Materials: BPA-free plastic

Type:  Swivel 360°

Cord Storage: Yes

The Cosori has a standard BPA-free plastic 360° swivel base that’s sturdy and fits the carafe well enough (+5). At the bottom of the base is the cord storage and also three small anti-slip rubber pads (+4).

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/cosori-glass-electric-kettle-gk172-co-power-cord-clleu1lk0000kzb88h2613kcu.jpg" alt="The two-pronged plug of the Cosori Glass Electric Kettle (GK172-CO)." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/cosori-glass-electric-kettle-gk172-co-power-cord-1-clleywajs000lzb888yfm85ad.jpg" alt="The power cord of the Cosori Glass Electric Kettle (GK172-CO) is 29.53 inches in length." width="300px" height="200px">

Type: three-pronged plug

Power: 1500 W

Rated Output: 120 V ~ 60 Hz

Cord Placement: Base

Cord Length: 29.5" (75.0 cm)

The Cosori has a 29.53 inch flat power cord, which should be plenty enough for household use. Its three-pronged plug is typically safer than a two-pronged one by having a grounding wire.

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **7.5**

*   User Control (30%) - **7.0**/10
    
*   Ease of Use (50%) - **8.0**/10
    
*   Cleaning (20%) - **7.0**/10
    

The Cosori Original Electric Glass Kettle has a slightly higher usability than its peers mostly thanks to the structure of its entire carafe. Its large and unobstructed opening made it easier to fill water and clean afterward. Other than that, the kettle was easy to use, carry, and pour to an acceptable standard. If only we could wrap the cord neatly around its storage.

### 7.0 - User Control

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/cosori-glass-electric-kettle-gk172-co-user-control-clletu2ml000fzb88ab2yfe3c.jpg" alt="The clear plastic power switch of the Cosori Glass Electric Kettle (GK172-CO)." width="300px" height="200px">

Control: One touch

Indicator Light: Blue LED

Display: No

Temperature Control: No

Presets: 5

Keep Warm: 30 minutes

Automatic Shut-Off”: Yes

Boil-Dry Protection: Yes

The Cosori has a standard one-touch switch with no digital display or temperature control (+1).

The power switch is made of clear plastic and is positioned near the bottom of the carafe along the handle. It also acts as the indicator light which will illuminate with a blue LED when the kettle is running (+2).

The kettle has an automatic shutoff feature which will activate when the thermo fuse detects that the temperature has reached boiling point (+2). Keep in mind that this feature will not kick in if you leave the lid open. If you do, however, you still don’t have to worry about overheating because the kettle’s boil-dry protection feature will turn off the kettle when no water is present (+2).

### 8.0 - Ease of Use

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/cosori-glass-electric-kettle-gk172-co-ease-use-clletwo4c000gzb88fsor7ubj.jpg" alt="A person in a grey shirt pouring water from the Cosori Glass Electric Kettle (GK172-CO) into a glass." width="300px" height="200px">

The Cosori is extremely simple to use, with only two distinctive buttons—one for power and one for opening the lid (+2). We also found no odd odor during the first boil, a sign of good material quality and upkeep before delivery.

The carafe felt very light when we picked it up—it’s only slightly more than 2 lbs (+2). Holding its handle felt good in the hand and was sturdy enough to be carried around when filled with water to the max. The pouring angle between the arm and the kettle was good as well, making the action effortless (+1).

The large opening of 4.33 inches allowed us to comfortably pour in water from the tap or any container (+1). The water level markings are in the middle of the carafe for easy viewing and precise decanting (+1).

The power base fits firmly below its carafe so the entire thing doesn’t wobble around during boiling (+1). Due to the flat shape of the cord, it was impossible for us to wrap it tightly around storage. After wrapping, the cord still stuck out quite a bit—6.3 inches, including the plug.

### 7.0 - Cleaning

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/cosori-glass-electric-kettle-gk172-co-cleaning-clletzxay000jzb886491ak0o.jpg" alt="A person in a black shirt holding the Cosori Glass Electric Kettle (GK172-CO) by its handle on one hand and the other hand wiping the carafe interior with a piece of tissue." width="300px" height="200px">

Cleaning the Cosori is very simple and effortless (+3). The opening is more than large enough for an adult hand to fit through and wipe the interior when necessary (+2). The limescale filter is removable for frequent cleaning and maintenance as well (+2).
