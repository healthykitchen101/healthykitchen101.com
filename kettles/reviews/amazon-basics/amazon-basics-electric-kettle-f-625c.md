*   Design (25%) - **7.5**/10
    
*   Usability (35%) - **7.5**/10
    

The Amazon Basics has just the right features to be a simple and easy-to-use electric kettle. Besides a glass carafe, there’s nothing fancy about its design. Nevertheless, its performance scores are actually quite high across the board, making it a good and low-cost choice.

**Things We Like**

*   Inexpensive
*   Easy to use
*   Light weight
*   Large capacity
*   Pretty fast boiling time
*   Long cord

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Cord rigid to wrap

With our electric kettle series in hand, we bought the Amazon Basics Electric Glass and Steel Kettle (F-625C) for 29.63$ to review. Our first impression upon unboxing and doing a test run were mixed. The kettle had a pretty fast boiling time but it waddled around the base quite a bit. Without further ado, check out the standardized  test results and detailed assessments below.

Performance
-----------

performance Scores: **7.9**

*   Boiling Time (45%) - **7.8**/10
    
*   Energy Consumption (30%) - **8.0**/10
    
*   Noise Level (15%) - **8.5**/10
    
*   Keep Warm (10%) - **7.0**/10
    

For such a standard kettle as the Amazon Basics, performance is what you should be focused on. Looking at the scores, we’d say it delivered well on boiling time, energy consumption, noise level, and heat retention.

### Boiling Time

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/amazon-basics-electric-kettle-f-625c-boiling-time-clkutp02g000lu2888xs61564.jpg" alt="1.5 liter of water boiling inside the Amazon Basics Electric Glass and Steel Kettle (F-625C). The digital timer displays 7 minutes and 13 seconds." width="300px" height="200px">

Room Temperature: 80°F / 26.7°C

Water Volume: 1.5 liters

Boiling Time: 7m 13s

For the common electric kettles (not gooseneck) like the Amazon Basics, we evaluate the time they take to boil 1.5 liters of water—a middle ground of their capacity. The kettle took 6 minutes and 57 seconds to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water (80°F/26.7°C) to boiling point (212°F/100°C).

This result was quite fast and matched with the kettle’s 1500 W of power, worthy of a 7.8/10.

### Energy Consumption

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/amazon-basics-electric-kettle-f-625c-energy-consumption-clkuszo9m0001u2880tp36hdp.jpg" alt="The power meter reads the energy consumption of the Amazon Basics Electric Glass and Steel Kettle (F-625C) to be 150 Wh." width="300px" height="200px">

Voltage: 113 V

Current: 11.17 A

Power: 1250 W

Energy Consumption: 150 Wh

We used a power meter to measure the Amazon Basics’ total energy consumption to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water to a rolling boil. The result was 150 Wh which was our standard for an 8/10.

### Noise Level

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/amazon-basics-electric-kettle-f-625c-noise-level-clkut148a0002u2884634a8i0.jpg" alt="The Amazon Basics Electric Glass and Steel Kettle (F-625C) is boiling 1.5 liters of water. The noise meter displays the maximum sound pressure level to be 75 dB. The power meter reads 113 V, 11.17 A, 1.25 kW, 0.74 Wh, 50 Hz, and 1.0 PF." width="300px" height="200px">

Noise Level: 75 dB

The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hearing_loss/what_noises_cause_hearing_loss.html#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency,prevent%20noise%2Dinduced%20hearing%20loss.)\-recommended 80 dB limit is for two hours of continuous noise exposure. During boiling, the Amazon Basics’s noise level peaked at 75 dB while reaching a rolling simmer. This result earned the kettle an 8.5/10.

### Keep Warm

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/amazon-basics-electric-kettle-f-625c-keep-warm-clkut23150003u288b7h6ffww.jpg" alt="On the right is a Thermo Pro two-probe digital thermometer displaying 202°F for both probes.

On the right is a digital timer displaying 5 minutes on the countdown." width="300px" height="200px">

After 5 Minutes: 202°F / 95°C

The glass carafe of the Amazon Basics doesn’t have the best material for heat retention. The kettle also doesn’t have temperature control or the Keep Warm feature. As a result, after 5 minutes, the temperature dropped from 212°F / 100°C to 202°F / 95°C. This equates to a 7/10 according to our data.

Design
------

design Scores: **7.5**

*   Carafe (50%) - **8.0**/10
    
*   Handle (10%) - **7.0**/10
    
*   Lid (20%) - **8.0**/10
    
*   Base (20%) - **6.0**/10
    

The Amazon Basics has a standard design, and we don’t mean that as a criticism. All the features of its carafe, spout, handle, lid, base, and power cord do well what they are meant to do. The only thing subpar about the kettle is the slightly wobbly kettle-to-base assembly.

### In the Box

The carafe is made of glass and holds 1.7 L (57.48 fl. oz.) which is around 7 cups of water (+2). It has a large opening, 3.54 inches in diameter, so you can comfortably pour in water from your tap or any container (+1).

The plastic spout of the Amazon Basics has a standard V-shape. There are water level markings in the middle of the carafe (+1). The limescale filter is positioned by the spout and is removable (+2).

Similar to many other cordless electric kettles, the Amazon Basics’ heating element is positioned inside the bottom of the carafe. There’s a ring of blue LED around the bottom which will illuminate when the kettle’s running, making it easy to spot in the dark (+2).

Materials: BPA-free plastic

Type: Cool-touch

The cool-touch handle is made of BPA-free plastic (+3). Its design is standard, without an ergonomic contour or anti-slip feature, but feels secure and comfortable on the wrist nonetheless (+4).

Materials: BPA-free plastic

Type: Hinged

Open Mechanism: Push-button pop-up

The Amazon Basics has a hinged lid that pop-ups to an 85° angle with a single push of a button located on the handle (+5). Its exterior is plastic with a stainless steel coating. The lid isn’t entirely cool-touch, only a small black area.

The interior is simply plastic which can be undesirable for someone who doesn’t like their water coming into contact with plastic material (+1). Nonetheless, we found no odd odor during the first boil. It has a silicone band around the circumference to make sure it’s tightly sealed when closed (+2).

### 6.0 - Base

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/amazon-basics-electric-kettle-f-625c-base-clkutgou5000fu2886potf3fk.jpg" alt="The top of the power base of the Amazon Basics Electric Glass and Steel Kettle (F-625C)." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/amazon-basics-electric-kettle-f-625c-base-1-clkuth9k9000gu2883tmy31kg.jpg" alt="The bottom of the power base of the Amazon Basics Electric Glass and Steel Kettle (F-625C) has a cord storage and also three small anti-slip rubber pads." width="300px" height="200px">

Materials: BPA-free plastic

Type: 360°

Cord Storage: Yes

The Amazon Basics has a standard BPA-free plastic 360° swivel base (+2). We found that the kettle fit the base but not very firmly, possibly due to the coupler not completely fitting (+0). At the bottom of the base is the cord storage and also three small anti-slip rubber pads (+4).

### Power Cord

Type: three-pronged plug

Power: 1500 W

Rated Output: 120 V ~ 60 Hz

Cord Placement: Base

Cord Length: 29.7" (75.5 cm)

The Amazon Basics has a 29.72-inch flat power cord, which should be plenty enough for household use. A three-pronged plug is typically safer than a two-pronged one by having a grounding wire.

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **7.5**

*   User Control (30%) - **7.0**/10
    
*   Ease of Use (50%) - **8.0**/10
    
*   Cleaning (20%) - **7.0**/10
    

The Amazon Basics don’t try to be anything more than it is— a standard and easy-to-use electric kettle. Thus, the kettle doesn’t create any unnecessary difficulties in controlling and using it.

### 7.0 - User Control

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/amazon-basics-electric-kettle-f-625c-user-control-clkutjzvz000ju288hhokbhl3.jpg" alt="The clear plastic power switch of the Amazon Basics Electric Glass and Steel Kettle (F-625C)." width="300px" height="200px">

Control: One touch

Indicator Light: Blue LED

Display: No

Temperature Control: No

Presets: No

Keep Warm: No

Automatic Shut-Off”: Yes

Boil-Dry Protection: Yes

The Amazon Basics has a standard one-touch switch with no digital display or temperature control (+1).

The power switch is made of clear plastic and is positioned near the bottom of the carafe along the handle. It also acts as the indicator light which will illuminate with a blue LED when the kettle is running (+2).

The kettle has an automatic shutoff feature which will activate when the thermo fuse detects that the temperature has reached boiling point (+2). Keep in mind that this feature will not kick in if you leave the lid open. If you do, however, you still don’t have to worry about overheating because the kettle’s boil-dry protection feature will turn off the kettle when no water is present (+2).

### 8.0 - Ease of Use

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/amazon-basics-electric-kettle-f-625c-ease-use-clkutkuiu000ku28883w84h0i.jpg" alt="A person in a dark green shirt pouring water from the Amazon Basics Electric Glass and Steel Kettle (F-625C) into a glass." width="300px" height="200px">

The Amazon Basics is extremely simple to use, with only two distinctive buttons—one for power and one for opening the lid (+2).

The handle felt good in the hand and seemed sturdy when we picked the kettle up—it was filled with water to the max (+2). It has a good pouring angle between the arm and the kettle, making the action effortless (+1).

The unobstructed and large opening of 3.54 inches allowed us to comfortably pour in water from the tap or any container (+1). The water level markings are in the middle of the carafe for easy viewing and precise decanting (+1).

Because the kettle didn’t fit firmly onto the base, the whole thing kind of wobbled around when reaching boiling point. It wasn’t to a dangerous degree, but slightly noisy nonetheless (+0).

Due to the flat shape of the cord, it was a bit rigid to wrap around the cord storage, but it was okay after we broke the cord in (+1). After wrapping, the cord sticks out 5.51 inches, including the plug.

### 7.0 - Cleaning

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/amazon-basics-electric-kettle-f-625c-cleaning-clo82urqh0001zh88c5ma8noa.jpg" alt="A person in a blue shirt holding the Amazon Basics Electric Glass and Steel Kettle (F-625C) by its handle on one hand and the other hand wiping the carafe interior with a piece of tissue." width="300px" height="200px">

Cleaning the Amazon Basics is very simple and effortless (+2). Its lid doesn’t get in the way and the opening is large enough for an adult hand to fit through and wipe the interior when necessary (+3). The limescale filter is removable for frequent cleaning and maintenance as well (+2).
