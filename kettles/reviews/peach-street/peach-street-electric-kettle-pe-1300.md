For an electric kettle that has no unique features, the Peach Street PE-1300 was quite the performer with how fast and quiet it boils water. It did consume slightly more energy than some top-listers but that’s only nitpicking from us.

The kettle has all of our desired features that makes it so easy to use. To top it all off, it’s very affordable as well.

**Things We Like**

*   Low price tag
*   Fast boiling time
*   Quiet boiling phase
*   Light weight
*   Easy to use
*   Large capacity

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Slightly high energy consumption
*   Plastic lid

We bought the Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300 on Amazon for $23.32 (at the time of writing), which was very affordable. Besides the black model we got, the kettles also come in aqua, blue, cotton candy pink, gray, purple, red, and white.

From the first look, the kettle has a relatively standard design. And, our first test run showed quite a fast boiling time. So, we couldn’t wait to see what else this one has to offer.

The Peach Street Electric Glass Kettle had good scores in the tests of Boiling Time, and Keep Warm. It was even excellent in the Noise Level test. Its Energy Consumption score wasn’t as high as some of its competitors though.

### Boiling Time

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/peach-street-electric-kettle-pe-1300-boiling-time-clo6v0wcj0001sw88124w3qpa.jpg" alt="1.5 liters of water boiling inside the Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300. The digital timer displays 07 minutes and 04 seconds." width="300px" height="200px">

Room Temperature: 80°F (26.7°C)

Water Volume: 50.72 fl. oz. (1.5 liters)

Boiling Time: 7m 04s

For the common electric kettles (not goosenecks) like the Peach Street, we evaluate the time they take to boil 1.5 liters of water—a middle ground of their capacity. This kettle took 7 minutes and 04 seconds to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water (80°F/26.7°C) to boiling point (212°F/100°C).

This was quite a fast result, matching the kettle’s 1500 W of power. It translates to an 8/10 score according to our data.

### Energy Consumption

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/peach-street-electric-kettle-pe-1300-energy-consumption-clo6v1ry40002sw88hex77x2k.jpg" alt="The power meter reads the energy consumption of the Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300 to be 152 Wh." width="300px" height="200px">

Voltage: 114 V

Current: 11.44 A

Power: 1300 W

Energy Consumption: 152 Wh

We used a power meter to measure the Peach Street’s total energy consumption to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water to a rolling boil. The result was 152 Wh which was worthy of a 7.6/10 score.

### Noise Level

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/peach-street-electric-kettle-pe-1300-noise-level-clo6v2uux0003sw885nd6aqr8.jpg" alt="The Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300 is boiling 1.5 liters of water. The noise meter displays the maximum sound pressure level to be 67.2 dB. The power meter reads 113 V, 8.125 A, 929 W, 100 Wh, 50 Hz, and 1.0 PF." width="300px" height="200px">

Noise Level: 67.2 dB

During boiling, the Peach Street’s noise level peaked at 67.2 dB while reaching a rolling simmer. This was significantly lower than the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hearing_loss/what_noises_cause_hearing_loss.html#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency,prevent%20noise%2Dinduced%20hearing%20loss.)\-recommended 80 dB and earned the kettle an impressive 9.3/10.

### Keep Warm

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/peach-street-electric-kettle-pe-1300-keep-warm-clo6v3ixo0004sw88atnndf8n.jpg" alt="On the right is a Thermo Pro two-probe digital thermometer displaying 203°F for both probes. In the middle is the Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300 with 1.5 liters of water and two probes inside. On the right is a digital timer on a 5 minute countdown." width="300px" height="200px">

After 5 Minutes: 203°F / 94.5°C

Although the glass carafe of the Peach Street doesn’t have the best properties for heat retention, the temperature only dropped from 212°F / 100°C to 203°F / 94.5°C after 5 minutes. This equaled a 7.5/10 in our Keep Warm test, quite good for a kettle that isn’t double-walled and doesn’t have the Keep Warm feature.

Design

Despite its standard design, the Peach Street Electric Glass Kettle still has most of the desirable features like water-level markings, an LED ring, and a removable mesh filter. The lid would be improved with a stainless steel interior and a rubber band around its circumference but it wasn’t a problem.

### In the Box

Capacity: 57.5 fl oz (1.7 L)

Weight: 2.1 lbs (1.0 kg)

Materials: Borosilicate glass

Spout: V-shaped

Opening Diameter: 3.54 in. (9 cm)

LED Ring: Blue

Filter: Removable mesh

Water Level Markings: Yes

Tea Infuser: No

The carafe is made of glass and has a capacity of 1.7 L (57.48 fl. oz) or 7 cups of water (+2). It has a wide lid opening, 3.54 inches in diameter, allowing you to comfortably pour in water from your tap or any container (+1). There are water level markings in the middle of the carafe (+1). 

The black plastic spout of the Peach Street has a standard V shape. The limescale filter is positioned by the spout and is removable (+2).

Similar to many other cordless electric kettles, the Peach Street’s heating element is positioned inside the bottom of the carafe. There’s a ring of blue LED around the bottom which will illuminate when the kettle’s running, making it easy to spot in the dark (+2).

### 7.0 - Handle

Materials: Cool-touch BPA-free plastic

Type: Cool-touch, anti-slip

The cool-touch handle is made of BPA-free plastic (+3). Its design is standard, without an ergonomic contour or anti-slip feature, but feels secure and comfortable on the wrist nonetheless (+4).

### 7.0 - Lid

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/peach-street-electric-kettle-pe-1300-lid-clo6vehah000esw883ytp5ap1.jpg" alt="The stainless steel pop-up lid of the Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300 and its button on the handle." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/peach-street-electric-kettle-pe-1300-lid-1-clo6vfb8j000fsw88ghq8ghj8.jpg" alt="The pop-up lid of the Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300 opens at an 80° angle." width="300px" height="200px">

Materials: BPA-free plastic

Type: Hinged

Open Mechanism: Push-button pop-up

The Peach Street has a hinged lid that pop-ups to a 80° angle with a single push of a button located on the handle (+4). That angle is good enough for the lid to move out of the way to get water in despite the attached limescale filter (+2).

The lid’s exterior and interior are both plastic which means some contact between plastic and hot water is unavoidable. Nonetheless, we noticed no odd odor during the first boil.

Unlike some other electric kettles we’ve tested, this one doesn’t have a silicone band around the circumference. Regardless, the lid still closes tightly (+1). It’s not cool-touch though, so be careful when the water’s still hot.

### 9.0 - Base

Materials: BPA-free plastic

Type: Swivel 360°

Cord Storage: Yes

The Peach Street has a standard BPA-free plastic 360° swivel base that’s sturdy and fits the carafe well enough (+5). At the bottom of the base is the cord storage in addition to  three small anti-slip rubber pads (+4).

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/peach-street-electric-kettle-pe-1300-power-cord-clo6vh4lv000isw88dre75qtw.jpg" alt="The three-pronged round power cord of the Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300 is 29.92 inches long (76 cm)." width="300px" height="200px">

Type: three-pronged plug

Power: 1500 W

Rated Output: 120 V ~ 60 Hz

Cord Placement: Base

Cord Length: 29.92 in. (76 cm)

The Peach Street has a 29.92 inch round power cord, which should be plenty enough for household use. It has a three-prong grounded plug which is typically safer than a two-pronged one.

The Peach Street Electric Glass Kettle checked all the boxes when it comes to how easy it is to use. It also takes no effort to clean thanks to its large lid opening and removable limescale filter.

### 7.0 - User Control

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/peach-street-electric-kettle-pe-1300-user-control-clo6vi2oy000jsw88424w1hyw.jpg" alt="The clear plastic power switch of the Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300." width="300px" height="200px">

Control: One touch

Indicator Light: No

Display: No

Temperature Control: No

Presets: No

Keep Warm: No

Automatic Shut-Off: Yes

Boil-Dry Protection: Yes

The Peach Street has a standard one-touch switch with no digital display or temperature control (+1). The power switch is made of clear plastic and is positioned near the bottom of the carafe along the handle. However, it doesn’t have an indicator light inside like with many other kettles. Thankfully, the carafe still has a blue LED ring to let you know the kettle is running (+2).

Like most other kettles, it has an automatic shutoff feature which activates when the thermal fuse detects that the ambient temperature is 100°C (+2). Keep in mind that this feature will not kick in if you leave the lid open. If you do, however, you still don’t have to worry about overheating because the kettle’s boil-dry protection feature will turn off the kettle when no water is present (+2).

### 9.0 - Ease of Use

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/peach-street-electric-kettle-pe-1300-ease-use-clo6viu0o000ksw8823n22wfq.jpg" alt="A hand pouring water from the Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300 into a glass of black tea." width="300px" height="200px">

The Peach Street is extremely simple to use, with only two distinctive buttons—one for power and one for opening the lid (+2).

The unobstructed and large opening of 3.54 inches allowed us to comfortably pour in water from the tap or any container (+1). The water level markings are in the middle of the carafe for easy viewing and precise decanting (+1).

The handle felt good in the hand and seemed sturdy when we picked the kettle up when filled with water to the max (+2). The nice angle between the arm and the kettle made pouring effortless (+1).

The power base fits firmly below its carafe so there is no wobbling around during boiling (+1). Thanks to the cord’s round shape, it wrapped tightly around for storage leaving only the plug sticking out by 2.95 inches (7.5 cm) (+1).

### 7.0 - Cleaning

On the right is a bottle of white vinegar." width="300px" height="200px">

Cleaning the Peach Street is very simple and effortless (+2). Its lid doesn’t get in the way and the opening is large enough for an adult hand to fit through and wipe the interior when necessary (+3).

The limescale filter is removable for frequent cleaning and maintenance as well (+2). To remove the limescale, we simply boil a mixture of vinegar and water with the kettle and rinse it afterward.
