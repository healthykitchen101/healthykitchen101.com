*   Design (25%) - **7.9**/10
    
*   Usability (35%) - **6.7**/10
    

We deem the Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle to not be a desirable product. Although its overall score isn’t too bad, it fails at all the important aspects in our electric kettle tests.

The kettle’s detriment is its slow boiling time and high energy consumption. A quiet boiling phase and a slightly above average ability to keep warm aren’t enough according to our assessment.

The Elite’s design quality is quite good. However, its awkward button placement ruined a product that should be straightforward to use—the whole point of an electric kettle.

**Things We Like**

*   Inexpensive
*   Easy to use
*   Light weight
*   Large capacity
*   Quiet when boiling

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Slow boiling time
*   High energy consumption

We bought the Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle (EKT-602) for $25.43 on Amazon (at the time of writing), which was quite inexpensive compared to others on the market. Unfortunately, our first test run with the product was quite disappointing due to its slow boiling time. Hopefully the complete test will reveal some saving grace for this kettle.

On a side note, the version that we chose was the 1.7-liter glass carafe. However, there’s also a 1-liter version, a 1.7-liter BPA-free plastic carafe version, and a 1.8-liter stainless steel double-wall carafe version that may be more of your cup of tea.

The Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle (EKT-602) didn’t perform well in our two most important tests—Boiling Time and Energy Consumption. Surprisingly, its performance in our Noise Level and Keep Warm tests were better than many of its competitors.

### Boiling Time

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/elite-gourmet-electric-kettle-ekt-602-boiling-time-cllhp56su0001a188a3ck6s44.jpg" alt="1.5 liter of water boiling inside the Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle (EKT-602). The digital timer displays 10 minutes and 04 seconds." width="300px" height="200px">

Room Temperature: 80°F

Water Volume: 1.5 liters

Boiling Time: 10m 4s

For the common electric kettles (not gooseneck) like the Elite Gourmet, we evaluate the time they take to boil 1.5 liters of water—a middle ground of their capacity. Confirming our first impression, the product took a staggering 10 minutes and 4 seconds to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water (80°F/26.7°C) to boiling point (212°F/100°C).

This result was our slowest recorded boiling time so far, even worse than our other tested kettles that had the same 1100 W of power. As a result, we had no choice but to give it a measly 4.9/10.

### Energy Consumption

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/elite-gourmet-electric-kettle-ekt-602-energy-consumption-cllhp5yih0002a188bssa59hr.jpg" alt="The power meter reads the energy consumption of the Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle (EKT-602) to be 161 Wh." width="300px" height="200px">

Voltage: 114 V

Current: 8.438 A

Power: 960 W

Energy Consumption: 161 Wh

We used a power meter to measure the Elite Gourmet’ total energy consumption to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water to a rolling boil. The kettle turned out to consume 161 Wh which was quite a bit more than other kettles on our data and consequently equaled a 5.8/10.

### Noise Level

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/elite-gourmet-electric-kettle-ekt-602-noise-level-cllhp6shl0003a1885nt08dda.jpg" alt="The Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle (EKT-602) is boiling 1.5 liters of water. The noise meter displays the maximum sound pressure level to be 68.3 dB. The power meter reads 114 V, 8.438 A, 960 W, 101 Wh, 50 Hz, and 1.0 PF." width="300px" height="200px">

Noise Level: 68.3 dB

The Elite Gourmet’s low noise level was its main saving grace, earning it an excellent and much needed 9.2/10. During boiling, the kettle’s noise level peaked at 68.3 dB while reaching a rolling simmer, which was significantly lower than the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hearing_loss/what_noises_cause_hearing_loss.html#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency,prevent%20noise%2Dinduced%20hearing%20loss.)\-recommended 80 dB. This outcome was one of our best so far alongside the Ovente Electric Kettle (KP72W).

### Keep Warm

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/elite-gourmet-electric-kettle-ekt-602-keep-warm-cllhp7vu80004a188ai76d1r7.jpg" alt="On the right is a Thermo Pro two-probe digital thermometer displaying 203°F for both probes. In the middle is the Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle (EKT-602) with 1.5 liters of water and two probes inside. On the right is a digital timer displaying 5 minutes on the countdown" width="300px" height="200px">

After 5 Minutes: 203°F / 95.5°C

The glass carafe of the Elite Gourmet doesn’t have the best material for heat retention, similar to the majority of our tested units. The kettle also doesn’t have temperature control for the Keep Warm feature.

However, the water temperature inside the kettle dropped noticeably slower than its peers. After 5 minutes, the temperature dropped from 212°F / 100°C to 203°F / 95.5°C while many others dropped to 201°F. Checking with our data, this equates to a good score of 7.5/10.

Design

*   Base (20%) - **9.0**/10
    

Looking at the Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle, it has a standard design in a good way. The kettle’s carafe, spout, handle, lid, base, and power cord all serve their purpose.

### In the Box

Capacity: 57.5 fl oz (1.7 L)

Weight: 2.1 oz (59 g)

Materials: Borosilicate glass

Spout: V-shaped

Opening Diameter: 3.5" (9.0 cm)

LED Ring: Blue

Filter: Fixed mesh

Water Level Markings: Yes

Tea Infuser: No

The carafe is made of glass and has a capacity of 1.7 L, 57.48 fl. oz, or 7 cups (+2). It has a large opening, 3.54 inches in diameter, allowing you to comfortably pour in water from your tap or any container (+1).

There are water level markings in the middle of the carafe (+1). The plastic spout of the Elite Gourmet has a standard V shape. The limescale filter is positioned by the spout and is removable (+2).

Similar to many other cordless electric kettles, the Elite Gourmet’s heating element is positioned inside the bottom of the carafe. There’s a ring of blue LED around the bottom which will illuminate when the kettle’s running, making it easy to spot in the dark (+2).

### 7.0 - Handle

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/elite-gourmet-electric-kettle-ekt-602-handle-cllhpg4p6000da188957e7zig.jpg" alt="A hand holding the Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle (EKT-602) by its handle." width="300px" height="200px">

Materials: Cool-touch BPA-free plastic

Type: Cool-touch, anti-slip

The cool-touch handle is made of BPA-free plastic (+3). It doesn’t have an ergonomic contour or anti-slip feature, but feels secure and comfortable on the wrist nonetheless (+4). On the handle are two buttons, the one above is to open the lid and the one below is to start the kettle.

### 7.0 - Lid

Materials: BPA-free plastic

Type: Hinged

Open Mechanism: Push-button pop-up

The Elite Gourmet has a hinged lid that pops up to an 80° angle with a single push of a button located on the handle (+3). However, in reality, the lid only popped up to 75° and we had to manually pull the rest. Anyway, the lid angle is enough to get water in (+2).

Its exterior is plastic with a stainless steel coating (+1). The lid isn’t entirely cool-touch, only a small black area.

The interior is simply plastic which can be undesirable for someone who doesn’t like their water coming into contact with plastic material. Nonetheless, we found no odd odor during the first boil.

Unlike some other electric kettles we’ve tested, this one doesn’t have a silicone band around the circumference. Nonetheless, the lid still closes tightly (+1).

### 9.0 - Base

Materials: 304 stainless steel

Type: Swivel 360°

Cord Storage: Yes

The Elite has a standard BPA-free plastic 360° swivel base that’s sturdy and fits the carafe well enough (+5). At the bottom of the base is the cord storage and also three small anti-slip rubber pads (+4).

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/elite-gourmet-electric-kettle-ekt-602-power-cord-cllhpr71g000na188ggffhcc9.jpg" alt="The three-pronged plug of the Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle (EKT-602)." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/elite-gourmet-electric-kettle-ekt-602-power-cord-1-cllhprsr4000oa188au68b5cx.jpg" alt="The power cord of the Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle (EKT-602) is 28.74 inches long." width="300px" height="200px">

Type:  three-pronged plug

Power: 1100 W

Rated Output: 120 V ~ 60 Hz

Cord Placement: Base

Cord Length: 28.7" (73.0 cm)

The Elite Gourmet has a 28.74 inch flat power cord, which should be enough for household use. It has a three-pronged plug which is typically safer than a two-pronged one by having a grounding wire.

Usability
---------

usability Scores: **6.7**

*   User Control (30%) - **6.0**/10
    
*   Ease of Use (50%) - **7.0**/10
    
*   Cleaning (20%) - **7.0**/10
    

Upon further inspection, the Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle has some problems because of one design feature. The kettle’s placement of its two buttons made it unnecessarily awkward to use.

### 6.0 - User Control

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/elite-gourmet-electric-kettle-ekt-602-user-control-cllhpmgfj000ka1886a133r64.jpg" alt="The handle of the Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle (EKT-602) has two buttons, the one above is the lid button and below is the power switch." width="300px" height="200px">

Control: One touch

Indicator Light: Blue LED

Display: No

Temperature Control: No

Presets: No

Keep Warm: 30 minutes

Automatic Shut-Off”: Yes

Boil-Dry Protection: Yes

The Elite has a standard one-touch switch with no digital display or temperature control (+1). However, the power switch is awkwardly positioned right below the lid button (-1).

The kettle doesn’t have an indicator light inside the switch like many of its peers. Thankfully, the carafe still has a blue LED ring to let you know the kettle is running (+2).

The kettle has an automatic shutoff feature which will activate when the thermo fuse detects that the temperature has reached boiling point (+2). Keep in mind that this feature will not kick in if you leave the lid open. If you do, however, you still don’t have to worry about overheating because the kettle’s boil-dry protection feature will turn off the kettle when no water is present (+2).

### 7.0 - Ease of Use

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/elite-gourmet-electric-kettle-ekt-602-ease-use-cllhpozpu000la18848pt8ahe.jpg" alt="A person in a grey shirt pouring water from the Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle (EKT-602) into a glass." width="300px" height="200px">

The standard control of the Elite should’ve meant that it was easy to use. However, since the power switch and the lid button were close to one another, we, more than once, accidentally pushed one instead of the other (+0). And we don’t think you’ll be safe from this unnecessary problem.

On the bright side, the carafe weighed only slightly more than 2 lbs. Also, the button placement doesn’t make the handle tricky to hold in any way. The carafe was also sturdy enough to be carried around when filled with water to the max (+2).

The large opening of 3.54 inches allowed us to comfortably pour in water from the tap or any container (+1). The water level markings are in the middle of the carafe for easy viewing and precise decanting (+1).

We found no odd odor during the first boil—a sign of good material quality and upkeep before delivery. The pouring angle between the arm and the kettle was good as well, making the action effortless (+1).

The power base fits firmly below its carafe so the entire thing doesn’t wobble around during boiling (+1). Despite the round shape of the cord, it didn’t wrap the tightest around its storage. However, it did wrap perfectly around in the end, leaving only the plug to stick out.

### 7.0 - Cleaning

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/elite-gourmet-electric-kettle-ekt-602-cleaning-cllhppujx000ma188a9i74fzx.jpg" alt="A person in a blue shirt holding the Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle (EKT-602) by its handle on one hand and the other hand wiping the carafe interior with a piece of tissue." width="300px" height="200px">

Cleaning the Elite is very simple and effortless (+2). Its lid doesn’t get in the way and the opening is large enough for an adult hand to fit through and wipe the interior when necessary (+3). The limescale filter is removable for frequent cleaning and maintenance as well (+2).
