The Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle is not a kettle we recommend. Although its overall score isn’t too bad, it fails to make the grade with the key things that really matter in our tests.

Two key detriments are  its slow boiling time and high energy consumption. On the other hand, it has an exceptionally quiet boiling phase and is slightly better than average with heat retention, but neither of these are a good enough compensation.

Furthermore, the Elite has an awkward button placement which defeats the purpose of what an electric kettle should be—a simple and easy to use appliance.

**Things We Like**

*   Inexpensive
*   Easy to use
*   Light weight
*   Large capacity
*   Quiet when boiling

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Slow boiling time
*   High energy consumption

We bought the Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle (EKT-602) for $23.10 on Amazon (at the time of writing), which was comparatively inexpensive. Unfortunately, on our first test run, the kettle disappointed with a slow boiling time. Read more to see if our complete test program revealed any saving grace for this kettle.

On a side note, the version that we chose was the 1.7-liter glass carafe. However, there’s also a 1-liter version, a 1.7-liter BPA-free plastic carafe version, and a 1.8-liter stainless steel double-wall carafe version that may be more of your cup of tea.

The Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle (EKT-602) failed to perform well enough in our two most important tests—Boiling Time and Energy Consumption. Surprisingly, its performance in our Noise Level and Keep Warm tests were better than many other competitors.

### Boiling Time

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/elite-gourmet-electric-kettle-ekt-602-boiling-time-cllhp56su0001a188a3ck6s44.jpg" alt="1.5 liter of water boiling inside the Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle (EKT-602). The digital timer displays 10 minutes and 04 seconds." width="300px" height="200px">

Room Temperature: 80°F

Water Volume: 1.5 liters

Boiling Time: 10m 4s

For the common electric kettles (not goosenecks) like the Elite Gourmet, we evaluate the time they take to boil a middle ground capacity of 1.5 liters of water. Much in tune with our first impression, this kettle took a staggering 10 minutes and 4 seconds to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water (80°F/26.7°C) to boiling point (212°F / 100°C).

This result was our slowest recorded boiling time overall, even worse than our other tested kettles that had the same 1100 W of power. As a result, we had no choice but to give it a measly score of 4.9/10.

### Energy Consumption

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/elite-gourmet-electric-kettle-ekt-602-energy-consumption-cllhp5yih0002a188bssa59hr.jpg" alt="The power meter reads the energy consumption of the Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle (EKT-602) to be 161 Wh." width="300px" height="200px">

Voltage: 114 V

Current: 8.438 A

Power: 960 W

Energy Consumption: 161 Wh

While conducting the boiling test, we also used a power meter to measure the Elite Gourmet’ total energy consumption. The kettle took 161 Wh to bring 1.5 liters of room temperature water to a roiling boil. This was considerably more than other kettles in our data and consequently scored a 5.8/10.

### Noise Level

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/elite-gourmet-electric-kettle-ekt-602-noise-level-cllhp6shl0003a1885nt08dda.jpg" alt="The Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle (EKT-602) is boiling 1.5 liters of water. The noise meter displays the maximum sound pressure level to be 68.3 dB. The power meter reads 114 V, 8.438 A, 960 W, 101 Wh, 50 Hz, and 1.0 PF." width="300px" height="200px">

Noise Level: 68.3 dB

The Elite Gourmet’s low noise level turned out to be its saving grace, earning it an excellent and much needed 9.2/10. During boiling, the kettle’s noise level peaked at 68.3 dB while reaching a rolling simmer, which was significantly lower than 80dB—the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hearing_loss/what_noises_cause_hearing_loss.html#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency,prevent%20noise%2Dinduced%20hearing%20loss.)’s safe level for up to 2 hours of noise exposure. This outcome was one of our best so far alongside the Ovente Electric Kettle (KP72W).

### Keep Warm

In the middle is the Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle (EKT-602) with 1.5 liters of water and two probes inside. On the right is a digital timer displaying 5 minutes on the countdown" width="300px" height="200px">

After 5 Minutes: 203°F / 95.5°C

The glass of the Elite Gourmet carafe isn’t the best material for heat retention, but this is much the same as other kettles we tested. The kettle also doesn’t have temperature control for the Keep Warm feature.

However, the water temperature inside the kettle dropped noticeably slower than its peers, possible due to a more fitted assembly. After 5 minutes, the temperature dropped from 212°F / 100°C to 203°F / 95.5°C while many others dropped to 201°F. Checking with our data, this equates to a good score of 7.5/10.

The Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle has a standard design, but is very functional in that the carafe, spout, handle, lid, base, and power cord all serve their purpose well.

### In the Box

Capacity: 57.5 fl oz (1.7 L)

Weight: 2.1 oz (59 g)

Materials: Borosilicate glass

Spout: V-shaped

Opening Diameter: 3.5" (9.0 cm)

LED Ring: Blue

Filter: Fixed mesh

Water Level Markings: Yes

Tea Infuser: No

The carafe holds 1.7 L (57.48 fl. oz.), or around 7 cups, and is made of glass (+2). It has a wide lid opening, 3.54 inches in diameter, so pouring in water from your tap or any container is very easy (+1).

There are water level markings in the middle of the carafe (+1). The spout is made of plastic and not shaped out of the glass carafe like some other kettles. It has a standard V shape and a removable limescale filter positioned by the spout (+2).

Similar to many other cordless electric kettles, the Elite Gourmet’s heating element is positioned inside the bottom of the carafe. There’s a ring of blue LED around the bottom which lights up when the kettle’s running, making it easy to spot in the dark (+2).

### 7.0 - Handle

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/elite-gourmet-electric-kettle-ekt-602-handle-cllhpg4p6000da188957e7zig.jpg" alt="A hand holding the Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle (EKT-602) by its handle." width="300px" height="200px">

Materials: Cool-touch BPA-free plastic

Type: Cool-touch, anti-slip

The cool-touch handle is made of BPA-free plastic (+3). It feels secure and comfortable on the wrist even though it doesn’t have an ergonomic contour or anti-slip feature (+4). On the handle are two buttons, the one above is to open the lid and the one below is to start the kettle.

### 7.0 - Lid

Materials: BPA-free plastic

Type: Hinged

Open Mechanism: Push-button pop-up

The Elite Gourmet has a hinged lid operated by a button on the handle which should pop up to an 80° (+3). However, in reality, the lid only popped up to 75°, but the remaining 5 degrees we could lift up manually. Regardless, the lid angle is enough to easily get water in (+2).

Its exterior is plastic with a stainless steel coating (+1). The lid isn’t entirely cool-to-touch, only a small black area.

The interior is plastic which some people may not like since hot water will contact the plastic material. Nonetheless, we detected no chemical odor during the first boil.

Unlike some other electric kettles we’ve tested, this one doesn’t have a silicone band around the circumference. However, the lid still closes tightly (+1).

### 9.0 - Base

Materials: 304 stainless steel

Type: Swivel 360°

Cord Storage: Yes

The Elite has a standard BPA-free plastic 360° swivel base that’s sturdy and fits the carafe well enough (+5). At the bottom of the base is the cord storage and also three small anti-slip rubber pads (+4).

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/elite-gourmet-electric-kettle-ekt-602-power-cord-cllhpr71g000na188ggffhcc9.jpg" alt="The three-pronged plug of the Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle (EKT-602)." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/elite-gourmet-electric-kettle-ekt-602-power-cord-1-cllhprsr4000oa188au68b5cx.jpg" alt="The power cord of the Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle (EKT-602) is 28.74 inches long." width="300px" height="200px">

Type:  three-pronged plug

Power: 1100 W

Rated Output: 120 V ~ 60 Hz

Cord Placement: Base

Cord Length: 28.7" (73.0 cm)

The Elite Gourmet has a 28.74 inch flat power cord, which should be enough for household use. It has a three-pronged plug which is typically safer than a two-pronged one by having a grounding wire.

Usability

Upon further inspection, the Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle has some problems because of one design feature. The kettle’s placement of its two buttons made it unnecessarily awkward to use.

### 6.0 - User Control

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/elite-gourmet-electric-kettle-ekt-602-user-control-cllhpmgfj000ka1886a133r64.jpg" alt="The handle of the Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle (EKT-602) has two buttons, the one above is the lid button and below is the power switch." width="300px" height="200px">

Control: One touch

Indicator Light: Blue LED

Display: No

Temperature Control: No

Presets: No

Keep Warm: 30 minutes

Automatic Shut-Off: Yes

Boil-Dry Protection: Yes

The Elite has a standard one-touch switch with no digital display or temperature control (+1). However, the power switch is awkwardly positioned right below the lid button (-1).

The kettle doesn’t have an indicator light inside the switch like many of its peers. Thankfully, the carafe still has a blue LED ring to let you know the kettle is running (+2).

The kettle has an automatic shutoff feature which will activate when the thermo fuse detects that the temperature has reached boiling point (+2). Keep in mind that this feature will not kick in if you leave the lid open. If you do, however, you still don’t have to worry about overheating because the kettle’s boil-dry protection feature will turn off the kettle when no water is present (+2).

### 7.0 - Ease of Use

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/elite-gourmet-electric-kettle-ekt-602-ease-use-cllhpozpu000la18848pt8ahe.jpg" alt="A person in a grey shirt pouring water from the Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle (EKT-602) into a glass." width="300px" height="200px">

The standard control of the Elite should’ve meant that it was easy to use. However, since the power switch and the lid button were close to one another, we, more than once, accidentally pushed one instead of the other (+0). And we don’t think you’ll be safe from this unnecessary problem.

On the bright side, the carafe weighed only slightly more than 2 lbs. Also, the button placement doesn’t make the handle tricky to hold in any way. The carafe was also sturdy enough to be carried around when filled with water to the max (+2).

The large opening of 3.54 inches allowed us to comfortably pour in water from the tap or any container (+1). The water level markings are in the middle of the carafe for easy viewing and precise decanting (+1).

We found no odd odor during the first boil—a sign of good material quality and upkeep before delivery. The pouring angle between the arm and the kettle was good as well, making the action effortless (+1).

The power base fits firmly below its carafe so the entire thing doesn’t wobble around during boiling (+1). Despite the round shape of the cord, it didn’t wrap the tightest around its storage. However, it did wrap perfectly around in the end, leaving only the plug to stick out.

### 7.0 - Cleaning

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/elite-gourmet-electric-kettle-ekt-602-cleaning-cllhppujx000ma188a9i74fzx.jpg" alt="A person in a blue shirt holding the Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle (EKT-602) by its handle on one hand and the other hand wiping the carafe interior with a piece of tissue." width="300px" height="200px">

Cleaning the Elite is very simple and effortless (+2). Its lid doesn’t get in the way and the opening is large enough for an adult hand to fit through and wipe the interior when necessary (+3). The limescale filter is removable for frequent cleaning and maintenance as well (+2).
