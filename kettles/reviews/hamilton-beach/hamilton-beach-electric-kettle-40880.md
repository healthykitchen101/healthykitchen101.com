The strength of the Hamilton Beach Stainless Steel Electric Kettle (40880) lies in its overall good performance. The durable stainless steel carafe and its affordable price makes this kettle a [winner](https://healthykitchen101.com/kettles/reviews/best/electric-kettles/).

Unfortunately, we couldn’t help but wish for a larger opening to make cleaning the kettle easier. Moreover, some unnecessary extra bottom stands made the carafe slightly wobbly when boiling.

**Things We Like**

*   Stainless steel carafe
*   Fast boiling time
*   Low energy consumption
*   Quiet boiling phase
*   Removable mesh filter

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Small opening
*   Wobbly kettle-to-base assembly

Coming up next, we’ll be reviewing the Hamilton Beach Stainless Steel Electric Kettle (40880) that we bought for $38.09 on Amazon (at the time of writing). Upon unboxing, the kettle got some plus points from us with its stainless steel carafe and spout.

However, the first boil revealed to us a wobbly kettle-to-base assembly and an average boiling time. Of course, we need some more thorough testing before we can give our final verdict on the product.

On a side note, besides the brushed stainless steel version that we chose, there’s a red-painted stainless steel version. There’s also another version that has an LED ring, unlike the two before.

The Hamilton Beach Stainless Steel Electric Kettle performed well in all of our tests, including boiling time, energy consumption, noise level, and keep warm. It didn’t excel at anything but it provided good results matching its specifications and that was everything we could ask for.

### Boiling Time

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/hamilton-beach-electric-kettle-40880-boiling-time-cllkevx92000qa188hdnyhrcm.jpg" alt="1.5 liter of water boiling inside the Hamilton Beach Stainless Steel Electric Kettle (40880). The digital timer displays 07 minutes and 04 seconds." width="300px" height="200px">

Room Temperature: 80°F

Water Volume: 1.5 liters

Boiling Time: 7m 4s

For the common electric kettles (not gooseneck) like the Hamilton Beach, we evaluate the time they take to boil 1.5 liters of water—a middle ground of their capacity. The product took 7 minutes and 4 seconds to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water (80°F/26.7°C) to boiling point (212°F/100°C).

This result was quite fast and matched with the kettle’s 1500 W of power, worthy of a 7.9/10.

### Energy Consumption

Voltage: 114 V

Current: 11.40 A

Power: 1290 W

Energy Consumption: 152 Wh

We used a power meter to measure the Hamilton Beach’s total energy consumption to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water to a rolling boil. The result was 152 Wh which was our standard for a 7.6/10.

### Noise Level

The noise meter displays the maximum sound pressure level to be 72.8 dB. The power meter reads 114 V, 11.40 A, 1.29 kW, 71 Wh, 50 Hz, and 1.0 PF." width="300px" height="200px">

Noise Level: 72.8 dB

During boiling, the Hamilton Beach’s noise level peaked at 72.8 dB while reaching a rolling simmer, which was lower than the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hearing_loss/what_noises_cause_hearing_loss.html#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency,prevent%20noise%2Dinduced%20hearing%20loss.)\-recommended 80 dB. This result earned the kettle an 8.7/10.

### Keep Warm

In the middle is the Hamilton Beach Stainless Steel Electric Kettle (40880) with 1.5 liters of water and two probes inside. On the right is a digital timer displaying 5 minutes on the countdown." width="300px" height="200px">

After 5 Minutes: 202°F / 95°C

Although the Hamilton Beach has a stainless steel carafe, it didn’t retain heat any better than its glass or plastic competitors. The kettle also doesn’t have temperature control for the Keep Warm feature.

After 5 minutes, the temperature dropped from 212°F / 100°C to 202°F / 95°C. This equates to a 7/10 according to our data.

The most desirable design traits of the Hamilton Beach Stainless Steel Electric Kettle for us are its stainless steel carafe and spout. It also has other beneficial features like a removable mesh filter and a water level window. However, it has the detriments of a small opening and wobbly kettle-to-base assembly.

### In the Box

Materials: Cool-touch BPA-free plastic

Type: Cool-touch, anti-slip

The cool-touch handle is made of BPA-free plastic (+3). It has a weird contour for the placement of the open-lid button which we didn’t find particularly convenient nor awkward to carry around. It doesn’t have an anti-slip feature, but feels secure and comfortable on the wrist nonetheless (+4).

### 7.0 - Lid

Materials: BPA-free plastic

Type: Hinged

Open Mechanism: Push-button pop-up

The Hamilton Beach has a hinged lid that pop-ups to an 80° angle with a single push of a button located on the handle (+4). Its exterior and interior are plastic which can be undesirable for someone who doesn’t like their water coming into contact with plastic material (+1). Nonetheless, we found no odd odor during the first boil (+1).

Unlike some other electric kettles we’ve tested, this one doesn’t have a silicone band around the circumference. Nonetheless, the lid still closes tightly (+1).

### 9.0 - Base

Materials: BPA-free plastic

Type: Swivel 360°

Cord Storage: Yes

The Hamilton Beach has a standard BPA-free plastic 360° swivel base that’s sturdy and fits the carafe well enough (+5). At the bottom of the base is the cord storage and also three small anti-slip rubber pads (+4).

### Power Cord

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/hamilton-beach-electric-kettle-40880-power-cord-cllkjliw60017a188ei7o272m.jpg" alt="The two-pronged plug of the Elite Gourmet Electric Glass Kettle (EKT-602)." width="300px" height="200px"><img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/hamilton-beach-electric-kettle-40880-power-cord-1-cllkjmdn30018a1887spqe79q.jpg" alt="Hamilton Beach Electric Kettle (40880) Power Cord 1" width="300px" height="200px">

Type: two-pronged plug

Power: 1500 W

Rated Output: 120 V ~ 60 Hz

Cord Placement: Base

Cord Length: 26.18 in. (66.5 cm)

The Hamilton Beach has a 26.18 inch flat power cord, which is a little short for our liking but should be enough for household use. The cord uses a two-pronged plug which is typically considered not as safe as a three-pronged one. Nonetheless, it should be safe since the power base doesn’t have a metal casing but a plastic one.

The Hamilton Beach Stainless Steel Electric Kettle poses no problem controlling, carrying, filling, and pouring. However, its small opening makes it more difficult to clean than its peers. And the fact that the kettle wobbles, although only slightly, when boiling can be worrisome.

### 6.0 - User Control

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/hamilton-beach-electric-kettle-40880-user-control-cllkjndj70019a1887b81ckve.jpg" alt="The metal black power switch of the Hamilton Beach Stainless Steel Electric Kettle (40880)." width="300px" height="200px">

Control: One touch

Indicator Light: Blue LED

Display: No

Temperature Control: No

Presets: 5

Keep Warm: 30 minutes

Automatic Shut-Off: Yes

Boil-Dry Protection: Yes

The Hamilton Beach has a standard one-touch switch with no digital display or temperature control (+1). Its carafe has a small red indicator light at the front that glows when the kettle’s running (+1).

The power switch is made of metal, painted black, and is positioned at the base of the carafe along the handle. We do have to point out a difference between this and the usual switch is that it flips upward instead of downward.

The kettle has an automatic shutoff feature which will activate when the thermo fuse detects that the temperature has reached boiling point (+2). Keep in mind that this feature will not kick in if you leave the lid open. If you do, however, you still don’t have to worry about overheating because the kettle’s boil-dry protection feature will turn off the kettle when no water is present (+2).

### 7.0 - Ease of Use

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/hamilton-beach-electric-kettle-40880-ease-use-cllkjokno001aa1888alp9519.jpg" alt="A person in a grey shirt pouring water from the Hamilton Beach Stainless Steel Electric Kettle (40880) into a glass." width="300px" height="200px">

Despite its stainless steel carafe, the Hamilton Beach weighs the same as other kettles with a glass carafe. It’s really easy to use, with only two distinctive buttons—one for power and one for opening the lid (+3).

The water level window in the middle of the carafe makes it easy to precisely fill water (+1). Although the carafe’s opening is small, it’s unobstructed so you can still comfortably pour in water from your tap or any container.

The handle contour could be better but it didn’t feel awkward in the hand and still seemed sturdy when we picked the filled-up kettle (+2). It has a good pouring angle between the arm and the kettle, making the action effortless (+1).

The different bottom stands created uneven spaces when placing the carafe onto the power base. This caused the kettle to be slightly wobbly when boiling (-1). It wasn’t to a dangerous degree, but slightly noisy nonetheless.

Due to the flat shape of the cord, it was a bit rigid to wrap around the cord storage, but it was okay after we broke the cord in. After wrapping, the cord sticks out 3.74 inches, including the plug.

### 6.0 - Cleaning

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/hamilton-beach-electric-kettle-40880-cleaning-cllkjpjej001ba188672dc447.jpg" alt="Hamilton Beach Electric Kettle (40880) Cleaning" width="300px" height="200px">

Cleaning the Hamilton Beach is a bit tricky since you can’t fit your hand through the opening to wipe the interior (+0). Thus, you’ll need a clamp to do so and the lid doesn’t get in the way of that (+4). On the other hand, the limescale filter is removable for frequent cleaning and maintenance (+2).
