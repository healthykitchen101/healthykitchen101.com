The Mueller Ultra Electric Kettle (M99S) offers a significantly high performance at an affordable price. Moreover, it has all the design features you’d want in an electric kettle, all of which are high quality.

It also poses no problems when using. If only its handle was a bit slimmer or curved at a more favorable angle to have more space for holding.

**Things We Like**

*   Fast boiling time
*   Low energy consumption
*   Quite when boiling
*   Maintain temperature well after boiling
*   Inexpensive
*   Easy to use

**Things We Don’t Like**

*   Handle not ideally shaped
*   Cord wrap loosely

From what we could find, the Mueller Ultra Electric Kettle (M99S) is the only kettle of this brand, so it has a lot to prove. We bought this product for $27.44 on Amazon (at the time of writing). At first, we thought the kettle had an uncommon design, especially the handle, but quite a fast boiling time. So, let’s wait no more and dive into it!

We were pleasantly surprised with the performance of the Mueller Ultra Electric Kettle across all four of our tests. Compared to many of its competitors, it had a faster boiling time, consumed less energy, was more quiet, and was able to maintain a higher temperature after 5 minutes.

### Boiling Time

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/mueller-ultra-kettle-m99s-boiling-time-cllnig6je0029a18899r0cm2y.jpg" alt="1.5 liter of water boiling inside the Mueller Ultra Kettle (M99S). The digital timer displays 07 minutes and 14 seconds." width="300px" height="200px">

Room Temperature: 80°F

Water Volume: 1.5 liters

Boiling Time: 7m 14s

For the common electric kettles (not gooseneck) like the Mueller, we evaluate the time they take to boil 1.5 liters of water—a middle ground of their capacity. The product took 7 minutes and 14 seconds to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water (80°F/26.7°C) to boiling point (212°F/100°C).

This result was quite fast and comparable to other kettles with the same 1500 W of power in our data, worthy of a 7.8/10.

### Energy Consumption

The Mueller M99S uses 148 Wh to bring 1.5 liters of water to a boil.

Voltage: 113 V

Current: 10.97 A

Power: 1230 W

Energy Consumption: 148 Wh

We used a power meter to measure the Mueller’s total energy consumption to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water to a rolling boil. The result was 148 Wh which was slightly less than its peers and equated to an 8.4/10 according to our data.

### Noise Level

The noise meter displays the maximum sound pressure level to be 70.3 dB. The power meter reads 113 V, 10.97 A, 1.23 kW, 73 Wh, 50 Hz, and 1.0 PF." width="300px" height="200px">

Noise Level: 70.3 dB

During boiling, the Mueller’s noise level peaked at 70.3 dB while reaching a rolling simmer, which was lower than the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hearing_loss/what_noises_cause_hearing_loss.html#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency,prevent%20noise%2Dinduced%20hearing%20loss.)\-recommended 80 dB. This result was very good but not the best we’ve recorded, so we gave it a 9/10.

### Keep Warm

After 5 Minutes: 203°F / 95.5°C

The glass carafe of the Mueller Ultra doesn’t have the best material for heat retention. The kettle also doesn’t have temperature control for the Keep Warm feature.

Nonetheless, the kettle was able to maintain a slightly higher temperature than its similarly designed competitor. After 5 minutes, the temperature only dropped to 203°F / 95.5°C from 212°F / 100°C, which equaled 7.5/10 in our scoreboard.

The Mueller Ultra Electric Kettle has a high build quality and all the desirable features including a mesh filter, an LED ring, water-level markings, and so on. The noteworthy thing about its design is that, despite its uncommon shape, it’s quite standard, which makes its high performance quite peculiar to us.

Capacity: 57.5 fl oz (1.7 L)

Weight: 1.9 oz (53 g)

Materials: Borosilicate glass

Spout: V-shaped

Opening Diameter: 3.1" (8.0 cm)

LED Ring: Blue

Filter: Fixed mesh

Water Level Markings: Yes

Tea Infuser: No

The carafe is made of glass and has a capacity of 1.7 L, 57.48 fl. oz, or 7 cups (+2). It has a large opening, 3.15 inches in diameter, allowing you to comfortably pour in water from your tap or any container (+1).

There are water level markings in the middle of the carafe (+1). The plastic spout of the Mueller has a standard V shape. The limescale filter is positioned by the spout and is removable (+2).

Similar to many other cordless electric kettles, the Mueller’s heating element is positioned inside the bottom of the carafe. There’s a ring of blue LED around the bottom which will illuminate when the kettle’s running, making it easy to spot in the dark (+2).

### 7.0 - Handle

Materials: Cool-touch BPA-free plastic

Type: Cool-touch, anti-slip

The cool-touch handle is made of BPA-free plastic (+3). It doesn’t have an ergonomic contour or anti-slip feature, but feels secure and comfortable on the wrist nonetheless (+4). Quite different from other electric kettles, the power switch of this one is on its handle.

### 7.0 - Lid

Materials: BPA-free plastic

Type: Hinged

Open Mechanism: Push-button pop-up

The Mueller has a hinged lid that pops up to a 75° angle with a single push of a button located in the middle of the lid (+5). This button is cool-touch so you don’t have to worry about scalding yourself because of the steam when opening the lid.

The lid has a plastic exterior and interior which can be undesirable for someone who doesn’t like their water coming into contact with plastic material. Nonetheless, we found no odd odor during the first boil (+1).

Unlike some other electric kettles we’ve tested, this one doesn’t have a silicone band around the circumference. Regardless, the lid still closes tightly (+1).

### 9.0 - Base

The Mueller Ultra Electric Kettle is simply straightforward to use. We had no problem controlling, filling, and pouring with it. However, it had an unfortunate inconvenience due to the handle.

### 7.0 - User Control

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/mueller-ultra-kettle-m99s-user-control-cllnjvchi002pa1887v5z387v.jpg" alt="The power switch located on the handle of the Mueller Ultra Electric Kettle (M99S)." width="300px" height="200px">

Control: One touch

Indicator Light: No

Display: No

Temperature Control: No

Presets: No

Keep Warm: No

Automatic Shut-Off: Yes

Boil-Dry Protection: Yes

The Mueller has a standard one-touch switch located on its handle with no digital display or temperature control (+1). The kettle doesn’t have an indicator light inside the switch like many of its peers. Thankfully, the carafe still has a blue LED ring to let you know the kettle is running (+2).

The kettle has an automatic shutoff feature which will activate when the thermo fuse detects that the temperature has reached boiling point (+2). Keep in mind that this feature will not kick in if you leave the lid open. If you do, however, you still don’t have to worry about overheating because the kettle’s boil-dry protection feature will turn off the kettle when no water is present (+2).

### 8.0 - Ease of Use

<img src="https://cdn.healthykitchen101.com/reviews/images/kettles/mueller-ultra-kettle-m99s-ease-use-cllnjwrew002qa18876xhaud2.jpg" alt="A person in a grey shirt pouring water from the Mueller Ultra Electric Kettle (M99S) into a glass." width="300px" height="200px">

The Mueller is extremely simple to use, with only two distinctive buttons—one for power and one for opening the lid (+2). The power base fits firmly below its carafe so the entire thing doesn’t wobble around during boiling (+1).

The handle seemed sturdy when we picked up the filled kettle(+2). It also has a good pouring angle between the arm and the kettle, making the action effortless (+1).

However, the handle’s curve is a lot closer to the carafe than the average electric kettles. This may lead to some inconveniences for people with big hands like one from our team (-1).

The unobstructed and large opening of 3.54 inches allowed us to comfortably pour in water from the tap or any container (+1). The water level markings are in the middle of the carafe for easy viewing and precise decanting (+1).

With the cord’s round shape, even though it doesn’t doesn't wrap the tightest around its storage, it still fits tightly to the opening. After wrapping, the cord only sticks out 3.74 inches including the plug.

### 7.0 - Cleaning
