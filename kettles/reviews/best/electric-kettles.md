Electric kettles are still the most efficient appliance for making any hot beverage or getting hot water quickly when you need it. Our trusty electric kettle at Healthy Kitchen 101 has been on the ready for rehydrating dried mushrooms, softening noodles, or reconstituting stock cubes—so we know how important its job is.

Most of all, electric kettles are handy for their rapid boiling time in ratio to water volume—faster than a stovetop kettle or even an induction cooktop. An electric kettle trumps a water boiler too because it pours faster, easier, and cordless kettles can be carried to any point.

Hands-on testing has given our team at _Healthy Kitchen 101_ insights and perspectives that we could never anticipate.

We evaluate an electric kettle’s **performance** based on its boiling time, energy consumption, noise level, and ability to keep warm.

For the kettle’s **design**, we check the material, construction, and the features on its carafe, handle, lid, and base.

The design features will dictate how high the kettle’s **usability** is. We assess how easy the user control is, as well as how easy it is to fill, lift, pour, and clean.

How We Picked
-------------

Choosing and ranking the best electric kettles incorporates a number of things. First and foremost is our hands-on experience combined with expert technical knowledge from our test design team. In addition, we also scour user reviews to find out what matters most to people and we use this to devise our scoring table.

Our Top Picks
-------------

The best electric kettle to buy is our pick of the best all-rounder. Other selections will suit different preferences from materials, to design, accessories, and also price.

1\. Best Overall: Cuisinart Electric Kettle 6 Presets CPK-17P1

*   Stainless steel carafe
*   5 preset temperatures
*   Keep Warm function
*   Relatively lightweight
*   Top performance 
*   Intuitive to use

*   Pricey
*   Narrow lid opening

The Cuisinart Stainless Steel Electric Kettle CPK-17P1 PerfecTemp with 6 preset temperatures is our supreme champion. Its most outstanding feature is its excellent ability to keep the water as hot as 209°F / 98.5°C for up to 30 minutes after switching off.

\[159\] Cuisinart Stainless Steel Electric Kettle Keep Warm

In addition, it had the fastest boiling speed in our tests, less than 7 minutes to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water (80°F) to a full rolling boil. It was more energy efficient than most, consuming only 148 Wh for the task.

The stainless steel carafe is not only excellent for keeping the water hot, but also for dampening noise during boiling, resulting in just over 70 dB. It’s also surprisingly light and the handle is textured which makes pouring easy.

The Cuisinart has all the desirable features such as an indicator light, water level markings, and a removable mesh filter—all high quality too. Its distinctive control panel has 6 temperature presets from 160°F to 212°F, making the price well worth it.

We thought, however, a couple of improvements could be a wider carafe opening and a stainless steel underside to the lid instead of plastic.

2\. Best Glass: Mueller Ultra Electric Kettle M99S

*   Fast boiling time
*   Low energy consumption
*   Quite when boiling
*   Maintain temperature well after boiling
*   Inexpensive
*   Easy to use

*   Handle not ideally shaped
*   Cord wrap loosely

The Mueller Ultra Electric Kettle M99S is our best glass option, notably for its performance and attractive price tag. Moreover, it has all the design features you’d want in an electric kettle, all of which are high quality.

\[135\] Mueller Ultra Kettle (M99S) Energy Consumption

We were pleasantly surprised with the performance of the Mueller across all four of our tests. Compared to many of its competitors, it had a faster boiling time than the average 8 minutes, consumed less energy than the common 150 Wh, and was quieter than the usual 75 dB. Also, it could retain considerable heat for up to 5 minutes, maintaining 203°F / 95.5°C.

The Mueller is well-constructed with all desirable features including a mesh filter, an LED ring, water-level markings, and more. Its performance surprised us since everything, besides the uncommon shape, was pretty standard.

The Mueller is simply straightforward to use. We had no problem with the controls, filling or pouring water. However, the handle could be slimmer or curved at a more favorable angle to have more space for holding.

3\. Best Stainless Steel: Secura Electric Kettle SWK-1701DA

*   Cool-touch exterior
*   Double-walled heat retention
*   No plastic contact to water
*   Rapid boiling speed
*   Affordable
*   Large lid opening

*   Energy consumption
*   No water-level markings

In terms of having a stainless steel body, the Secura Kettle SWK-1701DA is even better than the Cuisinart. Its double-wall construction keeps the water hot and prevents accidental burns.

\[230\] Secura Electric Kettle SWK-1701DA Lid 2

There is also no contact between water and plastic parts, which we know some people really appreciate. On top of everything, it only costs a little more than its glass competitors.

The carafe’s large lid opening also makes it extremely easy to fill water and also to clean. However, a silicone band around the lid for tighter seal, a mesh filter, and a water-level window would be nice extras.

Our performance tests confirmed product claims that the double-wall stainless steel helps to boil water faster and retains heat for longer. It took just over 7 minutes to boil 1.5 liters of water and remained at 205°F / 96.5°C after 5 minutes.

As a bonus, the kettle was quiet when boiling, reaching just under 75 dB. However, it consumed 155 Wh, slightly more energy than others.

4\. Best with Tea Infuser: Chefman Electric Kettle with 5 Presets

*   5 different presets
*   Removable tea infuser
*   Low price tag
*   Quite when boiling
*   Removable mesh filter

*   Overly simplified control
*   Slow boiling time
*   Small opening
*   Awkward handle

\[291\] Chefman Electric Kettle 5 Presets Cleaning

The Chefman Electric Kettle with 5 Presets RJ11-17-CTI-RL earned its place on our list for its excellent value at a low price. This included a tea infuser and 5 temperature presets (rare enough) plus a well-designed carafe, pop-up lid, control panel, and power base.

Truth be told, however, the kettle’s performance was average at best. Quiet boiling (only 69 dB) was the key to its acceptable performance score. Other than that, it was slow—over 9 minutes to boil 1.5 liters of water—with mid-range energy consumption and heat retention.

Its value propositions might be enough to convince you, but the handle was awkward to hold and the cord storage didn’t wrap well. Also, the lid opening is a little narrow therefore making it difficult to clean inside.
