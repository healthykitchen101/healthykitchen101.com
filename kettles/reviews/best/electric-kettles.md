Electric kettles are still the most efficient appliance for making any hot beverage or getting hot water quickly when you need it. Our trusty electric kettle at Healthy Kitchen 101 has been on the ready for rehydrating dried mushrooms, softening noodles, or reconstituting  stock cubes—so we know how important its job is.

Most of all, electric kettles are handy for their rapid boiling time in ratio to water volume—faster than a stovetop kettle or even an induction cooktop. An electric kettle trumps a water boiler too because it pours faster, easier, and cordless kettles can be carried to any point.

Hands-on testing has given our team at _Healthy Kitchen 101_ insights and perspectives that we could never anticipate.

We evaluate an electric kettle’s **performance** based on its boiling time, energy consumption, noise level, and ability to keep warm.

For the kettle’s **design**, we check the material, construction, and the features on its carafe, handle, lid, and base.

The design features will dictate how high the kettle’s **usability** is. We assess how easy the user control is, as well as how easy it is to fill, lift, pour, and clean.

How We Picked
-------------

Choosing and ranking the best electric kettles incorporates a number of things. First and foremost is our hands-on experience combined with expert technical knowledge from our test design team. In addition, we also scour user reviews to find out what matters most to people and we use this to devise our scoring table.

The highest scoring kettle is, therefore, the best electric kettle in every aspect. According to our results so far, the Cuisinart CPK-17P1 has the ideal balance of performance to design and usability—which are our three scoring criteria.

Our Top Picks
-------------

The best electric kettle to buy is our pick of the best all-rounder. Other selections will suit different preferences from materials, to design, accessories, and also price.

1\. Best Overall: Cuisinart Electric Kettle 6 Presets CPK-17P1

*   Stainless steel carafe
*   5 preset temperatures
*   Keep Warm function
*   Relatively lightweight
*   Top performance 
*   Intuitive to use

*   Pricey
*   Narrow lid opening

The Cuisinart Stainless Steel Electric Kettle CPK-17P1 PerfecTemp with 6 preset temperatures is our supreme champion. Its most outstanding feature is its excellent ability to keep the water as hot as **209°F / 98.5°C** for up to **30 minutes** after switching off.

\[159\] Cuisinart Stainless Steel Electric Kettle Keep Warm

In addition, it had the **fastest boiling speed** in our tests, less than 7 minutes to bring 1.5 liters of room-temperature water (80°F) to a full rolling boil. It was more energy efficient than most, consuming only 148 Wh for the task.

The stainless steel carafe is not only excellent for keeping the water hot, but also for **dampening noise** during boiling, resulting in just over 70 dB. It’s also surprisingly light and the handle is textured which makes pouring easy.

The Cuisinart has all the desirable features such as an indicator light, water level markings, and a removable mesh filter—all high quality too. Its distinctive control panel has 6 temperature presets from 160°F to 212°F, making the price well worth it.

We thought, however, a couple of improvements could be a wider carafe opening and a stainless steel underside to the lid instead of plastic.

2\. Best Glass: Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300

*   Low price tag
*   Fast boiling time
*   Quiet boiling phase
*   Light weight
*   Easy to use
*   Large capacity

*   Slightly high energy consumption
*   Plastic lid

The Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300 is our best glass option, notably for its performance and attractive price tag. Moreover, it has all the design features you’d want in an electric kettle, all of which are high quality.

\[375\] Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300 Noise Level

We were pleasantly surprised with the performance of the Peach Street across all four of our tests. Compared to many of its competitors, it had a **faster boiling time** than the average 8 minutes, was **much quieter** than the usual 75 dB, and consumed **just slightly more** energy than the common 150 Wh. Also, it could retain considerable heat for up to 5 minutes, maintaining 203°F / 95.5°C.

The Peach Street is well-constructed with all desirable features including a mesh filter, an LED ring, water-level markings, and more. Its performance surprised us since everything was pretty standard.

The Peach Street is simply straightforward to use. We had no problem with the controls, filling or pouring water.

3\. Best Stainless Steel: Secura Electric Kettle SWK-1701DA

*   Cool-touch exterior
*   Double-walled heat retention
*   No plastic contact to water
*   Rapid boiling speed
*   Affordable
*   Large lid opening

*   Energy consumption
*   No water-level markings

In terms of having a stainless steel body, the Secura Kettle SWK-1701DA is even better than the Cuisinart. Its **double-wall** construction keeps the water hot and prevents accidental burns.

\[230\] Secura Electric Kettle SWK-1701DA Lid 2

There is also no contact between water and plastic parts, which we know some people really appreciate. On top of everything, it only costs a little more than its glass competitors.

The carafe’s large lid opening also makes it extremely easy to fill water and also to clean. However, a silicone band around the lid for tighter seal, a mesh filter, and a water-level window would be nice extras.

Our performance tests confirmed product claims that the double-wall stainless steel helps to boil water faster and retains heat for longer. It took **just over 7 minutes** to boil 1.5 liters of water and remained at **205°F / 96.5°C** after 5 minutes.

As a bonus, the kettle was quiet when boiling, reaching just under 75 dB. However, it consumed 155 Wh, slightly more energy than others.

4\. Best with Tea Infuser: Chefman Electric Kettle with 5 Presets

*   5 different presets
*   Removable tea infuser
*   Low price tag
*   Quite when boiling
*   Removable mesh filter

*   Slow boiling time
*   Small opening
*   Awkward handle

\[291\] Chefman Electric Kettle 5 Presets Cleaning

The Chefman Electric Kettle with 5 Presets RJ11-17-CTI-RL earned its place on our list for its **excellent value** at a low price. This included a **tea infuser** and **5 temperature presets** (rare enough) plus a well-designed carafe, pop-up lid, control panel, and power base.

Truth be told, however, the kettle’s performance was average at best. Quiet boiling (only 69 dB) was the key to its acceptable performance score. Other than that, it was slow—over 9 minutes to boil 1.5 liters of water—with mid-range energy consumption and heat retention.

Its value propositions might be enough to convince you, but the handle was awkward to hold and the cord storage didn’t wrap well. Also, the lid opening is a little narrow therefore making it difficult to clean inside.

5\. Best Ceramic: Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle 14745

*   Attractive design
*   Gooseneck spout
*   Rare ceramic carafe
*   Well-priced
*   Tight lid

*   Slightly heavy
*   No filter
*   Loose cord wrap
*   No water-level markings

The Bella Ceramic Gooseneck Electric Kettle 14745 is all about great aesthetics. We chose to feature this kettle for its eye-catching **ceramic carafe** and practical **gooseneck spout**.

\[195\] Bella Ceramic Kettle 14745 Cleaning

Good looks aside, it was slow to boil—over 8 minutes—but energy consumption and noise level were, at least, up to standard at 158 Wh and 73 dB. Unfortunately, our high hopes for heat retention were somewhat dashed seeing the temperature drop to 202°F / 95°C after 5 minutes which was no different from glass kettles.

The ceramic carafe precluded a mesh filter and an LED ring, making it difficult to see in the dark even though it has an indicator light. The power base wasn’t the sturdiest either.

We thought to recommend this kettle for the senior tea enthusiasts. However, the kettle’s on the heavier side, its lid is tight, and its smooth handle lacks extra grip. All things considered, it’s not ideal for pour-over coffee either.

The silver lining here is that the kettle is very easy to clean. Maybe another ceramic electric kettle will take the Bella’s place soon enough.
