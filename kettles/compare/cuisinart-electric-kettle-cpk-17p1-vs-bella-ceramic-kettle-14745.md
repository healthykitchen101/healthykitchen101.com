The Cuisinart Electric Kettle CPK-17P1 is better than the Bella Ceramic Kettle 14745 in every aspect. Nonetheless, the Bella’s visual may appeal to you.

The Bella’s performance score wasn’t too bad but the Cuisinart was able to boil water faster, more quietly, and consumed less energy. In addition to 6 temperature settings, the Cuisinart can also maintain the desired temperature up to 30 minutes afterward.

In terms of design, the Cuisinart CPK-17P1 boasts a sleek stainless steel exterior with a blue backlit water window and a textured handle for extra grip. Conversely, the Bella 14745 features a distinctive ceramic construction with a stylish design, adding a touch of flair to the kitchen.

However, the ceramic material may be more susceptible to breakage compared to the durable stainless steel of the Cuisinart kettle. Additionally, the Bella has a tight lid, smooth handle, and slightly heavier build, making it more difficult to use.
