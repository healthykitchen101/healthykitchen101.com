The Chefman Electric Kettle 5 Presets offers some rare and valuable features that the Cosori Electric Kettle GK172-CO doesnâ€™t. In the end, it all came down to their differences in performance.

The Chefman offers 5 temperature settings, all accessible through a one-touch control interface, as easy to use as the single-setting functionality of the Cosori. It also includes a detachable tea infuser, enhancing its versatility, and is priced only slightly higher than the Cosori.

Both kettles feature an LED ring, but the Chefman's ring changes color based on the selected preset, adding a fun and practical element to its design. Meanwhile, the Cosori has a rare stainless steel inner lid which eliminates any water to plastic contact.

Despite both being glass, the Cosori was slightly quieter when boiling with better heat retention afterward. The Cosori, with its higher power draw, consumed significantly more energy. Unfortunately, the Chefman fell short in terms of boiling speed which was the more important factor in our evaluation.
