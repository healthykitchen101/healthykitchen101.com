The Comfee Electric Kettle CEKG003 and the stainless steel Hamilton Beach Electric Kettle (40880) each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Due to its more thoughtful design however, the Comfee narrowly emerged as the better and cheaper choice.

Both kettles have the same power output, but the Hamilton Beach was slightly faster at boiling water. The Comfee, however, was quieter than the already quiet Hamilton Beach, although its glass material didn’t retain heat as well after boiling and it consumed significantly more electricity.

In terms of design, the Hamilton Beach has a water-level window with a white LED, while the Comfee has water-level markings and a blue LED ring. The Hamilton Beach has unnecessary extra bottom stands that make the carafe slightly wobbly when boiling, whereas the Comfee has less efficient cord storage.

The Comfee’s limescale filter isn’t removable like the Hamilton Beach’s, but this isn’t a major issue. Cleaning is more challenging with the Hamilton Beach unfortunately, due to its smaller lid opening.
