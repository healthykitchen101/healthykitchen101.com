The Hamilton Beach Electric Kettle (40880) is a solid choice for a low-cost stainless steel kettle but it has a few problems that garnered it lower scores than glass Amazon Basics Electric Kettle F-625C.

Performance-wise, the two kettles are very similar. Upon further inspection, the Amazon Basics had slightly slower boiling speed and was noisier but consumed less energy. Disappointingly on the Hamilton Beach’s end however, it had the same level of heat retention after boiling to its opponent.

Design-wise, the Hamilton Beach’s carafe uses a water-level window with a white LED while the Amazon Basics’ glass carafe has water-level markings and a blue LED ring. Although both have a removable limescale filter, the Hamilton Beach’s lid opening is smaller making cleaning a bit more difficult compared to the Amazon Basics.

The Hamilton Beach has some unnecessary extra bottom stands that make the carafe slightly wobbly when boiling. On the other hand, the Amazon Basics was slightly wobbly while boiling due to the coupler not completely fitting.
