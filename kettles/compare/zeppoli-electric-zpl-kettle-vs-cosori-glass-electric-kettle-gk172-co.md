At similar prices, the Zeppoli Electric Kettle ZPL-KETTLE is slightly better than the Cosori Electric Kettle (GK172-CO) in all aspects including performance, design, and usability.

These two glass kettles have high quality design features like water-level markings, an LED ring, a lid button, and a power switch. Additionally, they both have large openings for easy cleaning, although the Cosori lacks a silicone band for better sealing.

One notable feature of the Cosori kettle is its stainless steel inner lid, so thereâ€™s no plastic to water contact. However, unlike the Zeppoli, the Cosori's limescale filter is not removable for frequent maintenance.

At the same power draw, the Zeppoli boils water faster, consumes less energy, is quieter when boiling, and retains heat slightly better than the Cosori afterward. The Zeppoli also costs slightly less than the already inexpensive Cosori.
