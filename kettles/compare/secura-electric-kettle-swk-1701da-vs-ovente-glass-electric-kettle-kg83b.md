As our top stainless steel choice, the double-wall Secura Electric Kettle SWK-1701DA outperforms the Ovente Glass Electric Kettle KG83B, although both have some issues worth noting.

The Secura kettle excels in heat retention due to its double-wall construction, which also ensures safety by remaining cool to the touch during boiling. In contrast, due to its lower power draw, the Ovente is much slower than the Secura. However, the Ovente consumes noticeably less electricity and is quieter during boiling.

The Secura's holed filter is less effective at managing limescale buildup compared to the Ovente's mesh filter. Additionally, the Secura lacks a visible water-level indicator on the exterior, though it has measurement markings inside.

On the other hand, the Ovente has a smaller capacity and less conveniently placed buttons compared to the Secura. Despite its lower price, these drawbacks make the Ovente less desirable than the Secura.
