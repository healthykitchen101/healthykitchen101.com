Having similar designs, the Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300 and the Zeppoli Electric Kettle ZPL-KETTLE also interestingly share the same overall score. However, there are details that go into why we chose the former as our best glass pick and not the latter.

At the same power draw, the Zeppoli is slightly more efficient in terms of boiling speed, energy consumption, and noise level. And, their glass material poses equally good heat retention.

Their design are neigh identical, having all the desirable features including water-level markings, an LED ring, and a removable limescale mesh filter. However, we deemed that the Zeppoli’s flat power cord making it hard to wrap neatly around its storage could be a lasting inconvenience compared to the Peach Street’s round one, especially considering the kettle’s slightly higher price than its competition.
