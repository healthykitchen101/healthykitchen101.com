Although its aesthetic was pleasing, when it comes to proper evaluation, the Bella Ceramic Kettle 14745 falls behind the Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300 significantly. With a lower power draw, the Bella boils water more slowly and noisily, consumes more energy, and doesn’t retain heat as well as the Peach Street.

Design-wise, the Bella has a gooseneck for more precise pouring and a silicone band for its lid making it close more tightly. However, it has no water-level markings, only a maximum volume indicator. Its holed filter also isn’t as effective on limescale as the Peach Street’s mesh filter.

In addition to a flimsy base, the Bella, with its higher price, doesn’t offer as much value as the Peach Street.
