Comparing the Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300 to another kettle of the same material like the Cosori Electric Kettle (GK172-CO) makes it apparent why the former is our best glass pick.

Both kettles have high quality design features like water-level markings, an LED ring, a lid button, and a power switch. They also have similarly large openings for cleaning but the Cosori doesn’t have a silicone band for better sealing.

Standing out from many other kettles, the Cosori has a stainless steel inner lid making the kettle zero contact of hot water to plastic. However, its limescale filter isn’t removable like the Peach Street.

At the same power draw, the Peach Street outshines the Cosori by boiling water more rapidly, consuming less energy, operating more quietly during boiling, and exhibiting slightly better heat retention after boiling. Furthermore, the Peach Street kettle costs even less than the already budget-friendly Cosori option, adding to its appeal.
