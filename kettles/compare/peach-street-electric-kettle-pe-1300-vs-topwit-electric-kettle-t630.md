The Topwit Electric Kettle T630 has some unique features but not all of them are positive. As a result, it doesn’t come anywhere close to being our best glass pick which is the Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300.

At similar prices, the Topwit has a rare capacity of 2 L as opposed to the Peach Street’s more common 1.7 L. Both have water-level markings and an LED ring but the Topwit unfortunately lacks a proper limescale filter, cord storage, and a lid button that the Peach Street has.

With a lower power draw, it wasn’t a surprise that the Topwit has a lower boiling time than the Peach Street. It also has worse heat retention despite also being glass. However, it consumed less energy and was even quieter than the already well-performed Peach Street.
