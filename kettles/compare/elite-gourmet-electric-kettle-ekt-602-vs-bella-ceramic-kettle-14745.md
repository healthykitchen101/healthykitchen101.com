The Bella Ceramic Kettle 14745 may look appealing, but it still falls short in comparison to the subpar glass Elite Gourmet Electric Kettle EKT-602.

The Elite Gourmet has exterior water-level markings, an LED ring, and a removable mesh filter that the Bella lacks. On the downside, the Elite Gourmet has poorly placed buttons that are too close to one another.

The Bella features a gooseneck for precision pouring and a silicone band on the lid for a better seal. Unfortunately, it further fails to justify its higher price with its flimsy base.

Performance was what dragged the Elite Gourmet down. Even considering its lower power draw, the Elite Gourmet's biggest drawback is its slow boiling speed, which is a significant issue for an electric kettle. It consumed more electricity than the Bella as well. On the bright side, it was quieter while boiling and had better heat retention.
