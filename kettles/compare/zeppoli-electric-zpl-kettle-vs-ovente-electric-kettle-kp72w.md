In the comparison between the glass Zeppoli Electric Kettle ZPL-KETTLE and the plastic Ovente Electric Kettle KP72W, the Ovente initially displays some notable advantages, but ultimately falls short due to its drawbacks.

While the Ovente consumes slightly less energy and operates at a similar noise level to the Zeppoli, it suffers from a significantly slower boiling time. Moreover, being made of plastic, the Ovente lacks the heat retention properties and durability of the glass Zeppoli, although it compensates with a lighter weight and lower price point.

In terms of design, the Zeppoli boasts water-level markings and a blue LED ring, whereas the Ovente features a water-level window illuminated by a white LED. Both kettles include removable limescale filters, but the Ovente's smaller lid opening makes cleaning a bit more challenging compared to the Zeppoli.
