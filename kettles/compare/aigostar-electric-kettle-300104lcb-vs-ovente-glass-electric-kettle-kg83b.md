The Aigostar Electric Kettle 300104LCB and the Ovente Electric Kettle KG83B share similar prices and are both equally average among our tested line-up.

The two kettles have high-quality design elements such as water-level markings and LED rings on their carafes. Unfortunately, they also share a non-removable limescale filter and awkward button placement for power switching and lid opening.

With the same power draw, the two kettles tied in terms of boiling speed, energy consumption, and noise level. For some reason however, the Aigostar showed worse heat retention than the Ovente despite also being made of glass.
