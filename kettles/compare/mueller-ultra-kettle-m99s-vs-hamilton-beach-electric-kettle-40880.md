Both the Mueller Ultra Kettle M99S and the Hamilton Beach Electric Kettle (40880) are solid choices with a difference in their material.

In the end, the former won thanks to its better thought out design. The Hamilton Beach has some unnecessary extra bottom stands that make the carafe slightly wobbly when boiling.

Other than that, both kettles have high quality design features including a removable limescale filter. In addition, the Mueller’s glass carafe has water-level markings and a blue LED ring while the Hamilton Beach’s carafe uses a water-level window with a white LED.

With identical power draws, the two kettles exhibited similar boiling speeds. However, the Hamilton Beach consumed more energy and emitted more noise during operation. Also, despite its stainless steel construction, the Hamilton Beach didn’t have as good heat retention.
