The Ovente Electric Kettle KP72W isn’t the best plastic choice but it’s still better than the unique but flawed glass Topwit Electric Kettle T630.

In terms of design features, the Ovente has a water-level window lit by a white LED while the Topwit includes water-level markings and a blue LED.

The plastic construction of the Ovente means it’s less durable than the Topwit but also lighter and cheaper. Its lid opening is a bit smaller but you can still fit your hand through.

The Topwit offers a rare 2 L capacity, compared to the Ovente’s standard 1.7 L. Unfortunately, it lacks a proper limescale filter, cord storage, and a lid button that the Ovente has.

The two kettles share the same performance score but with some segmental differences. The Ovente, with its higher power draw, boiled water slightly faster while consuming the same amount of electricity. However, the Topwit was quieter while boiling and had better heat retention.
