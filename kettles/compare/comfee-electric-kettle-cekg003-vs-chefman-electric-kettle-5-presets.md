The Chefman Electric Kettle 5 Presets loses to the Comfee Electric Kettle CEKG003 in terms of overall scores but it does offer some rare and valuable features that its opponent doesn’t.

The Chefman kettle boasts 5 temperature settings, easily operated through a one-touch control interface, making it just as user-friendly as the single-setting Cosori. It also comes with a detachable tea infuser, adding to its versatility, and is priced slightly above the Comfee.

Both kettles include an LED ring, but the Chefman's ring changes color according to the selected preset, introducing a playful and practical touch to its design. On a different note, the two kettles have cord storage but their cords don’t wrap neatly.

Performance-wise, the Comfee scored better with its faster boiling time thanks to a higher power draw. On the other hand, it consumed significantly more electricity, wasn’t as quiet, and didn’t have as good heat retention as the Chefman.
