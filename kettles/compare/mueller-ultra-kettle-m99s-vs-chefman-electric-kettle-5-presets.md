The Chefman Electric Kettle 5 Presets offers several unique and valuable features that the Mueller Ultra Kettle M99S lacks. However, its overall performance score lowers its comparison to the Mueller.

The Chefman includes 5 temperature settings, accessible via a one-touch control interface, while the Mueller is single-setting. Both kettles have a removable limescale filter and an LED ring, but the Chefmanâ€™s LED ring changes color based on the selected preset, adding both a fun and practical element to its design. Additionally, the Chefman features a detachable tea infuser, enhancing its versatility, while being priced the same as the Mueller.

Despite these features, the Chefman underperforms in boiling speed, energy consumption, and heat retention, though it matches the Mueller in noise level.
