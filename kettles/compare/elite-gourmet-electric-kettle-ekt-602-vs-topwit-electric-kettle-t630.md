The subpar Elite Gourmet Electric Kettle EKT-602 still scored better than the Topwit Electric Kettle T630 despite some unique features that the latter has.

Despite its lower power draw, the Topwit boiled water faster and more quietly while consuming less electricity. It didn’t retain heat as well as the Elite Gourmet afterward though.

Design-wise, both kettles include water-level markings and an LED ring. The Topwit stands out with its rare 2 L capacity, whereas the Topwit Electric Kettle T630 has a standard 1.7 L.

Unfortunately, the Topwit lacks a proper limescale filter, cord storage, and a lid button—features that the Elite Gourmet includes. Meanwhile, the Elite Gourmet suffers from inconvenient button placement.
