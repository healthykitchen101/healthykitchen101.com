The Mueller Ultra Kettle M99S, while not the best in terms of design, is still significantly better than the Dezin Electric Kettle DZ380.

Both kettles have water-level markings and an LED ring, but the Dezin lacks convenient features like cord storage and a lid button. Additionally, the Dezin does not have a proper limescale filter, requiring more frequent cleaning and descaling compared to the Mueller.

Both kettles have similar heat retention with their glass carafes. However, the Dezin has a much slower boiling speed and consumes slightly more electricity, likely due to its lower power draw. On the positive side, the Dezin is top-tier in terms of quiet boiling, even better than the Mueller.
