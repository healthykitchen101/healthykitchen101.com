The Ovente Glass Electric Kettle KG83B can only be described as average compared to the Zeppoli Electric Kettle ZPL-KETTLE.

Even considering its lower power draw, the Ovente was still much slower. Additionally, it was noisier and consumed slightly more energy than the Zeppoli. Moreover, the Ovente doesnâ€™t only have a smaller capacity, but its heat retention was worse as well.

While both kettles boast high-quality design elements such as water-level markings and LED rings on their carafes, there are notable differences between the two. The Ovente falls short in terms of user-friendliness as its limescale filter is not removable and its button placement is less convenient compared to the Zeppoli.

Consequently, despite being priced lower, these drawbacks make the Ovente less desirable than the Zeppoli.
