The Comfee Electric Kettle CEKG003 showed some promising qualities before we got to evaluating some of the newer kettles. And one of the few that outshone it was the Zeppoli Electric Kettle ZPL-KETTLE.

Both kettles boast high-quality design elements, including water-level markings, an LED ring, a lid button, and a power switch. However, the Comfee lacks a removable limescale filter and its cord storage is not as efficient as that of the Zeppoli.

At the same power draw, the Zeppoli was better than the Comfee in every aspect including boiling speed, energy consumption, noise level, and heat retention. To top it all off, the Zeppoli is even cheaper than the already affordable Comfee.
