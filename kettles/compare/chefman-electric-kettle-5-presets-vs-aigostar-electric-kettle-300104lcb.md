Although the Chefman Electric Kettle 5 Presets RJ11-17-CTI-RL scored just one decimal point higher than the Aigostar Electric Kettle 300104LCB overall, it offers some unique valuable features.

The Chefman includes 5 temperature settings, accessible via a one-touch control interface, as easy to use as the Aigostar’s single-setting. Both kettles have a limescale mesh filter and an LED ring, but the Chefman’s LED ring changes color based on the selected preset, adding both a fun and practical element to its design.

Though priced higher, the Chefman additionally features a detachable tea infuser, enhancing its versatility. On the other hand, the Aigostar has an issue with awkward button placement.

With the same power draw, the Chefman boils water faster while consuming more energy than the Aigostar. Despite both being glass, the Chefman had better heat retention while not being as quiet as the Aigostar while boiling.
