Compared to our best glass pick—the Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300, the Ovente Glass Electric Kettle KG83B can only be described as average.

Even considering its lower power draw, the Ovente was still much slower. Moreover, the Ovente doesn’t only have a smaller capacity, but its heat retention was worse as well. On the brightside, it was as quiet and even consumed slightly less energy than the Peach Street.

Both kettles have high quality design features like water-level markings and an LED ring on their carafes. However, the Ovente’s limescale filter isn’t removable and its button placement is more awkward than the Peach Street, so the cheaper price isn’t worth it.
