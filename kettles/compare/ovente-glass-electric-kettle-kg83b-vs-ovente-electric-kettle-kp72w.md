It’s interesting to see two kettles of the same brand getting the same overall score despite their material differences.

The plastic Ovente Electric Kettle KP72W is lighter and cheaper but also less durable than the Ovente Glass Electric Kettle KG83B. In terms of design features, the former uses a water-level window lit by a white LED whereas the latter has water-level markings and a blue LED ring.

Cleaning-wise, the plastic Ovente features a mesh filter that helps reduce the descaling frequency better than the glass’ fixed one. Its lid opening is a bit smaller but you can still fit your hand through.

At the same power output, the KG83B boiled water slower while consuming more energy than the KP72W. On the bright side, it was quieter while boiling and had better heat retention.
