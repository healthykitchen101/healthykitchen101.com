Both the Chefman Electric Kettle 5 Presets RJ11-17-CTI-RL and the Topwit Electric Kettle T630 have some unique features. The winning factors for the Chefman was that its features were actually helpful.

The Chefman kettle boasts 5 temperature settings, easily operated through a one-touch control interface, making it just as user-friendly as the single-setting Topwit. Both kettles include an LED ring, but the Chefman's ring changes color according to the selected preset, introducing a playful and practical touch to its design. It also comes with a detachable tea infuser, adding to its versatility.

The more affordable Topwit boasts an uncommon 2-liter capacity, unlike the Chefman's 1.8 liters. Unfortunately, the Topwit is missing a dedicated limescale filter, cord storage, and a convenient lid button.

Interestingly, the Topwit performed better than the Chefman in boiling water. It was faster, consumed less energy while being quieter. Both kettles being glass, they had the same level of heat retention.
