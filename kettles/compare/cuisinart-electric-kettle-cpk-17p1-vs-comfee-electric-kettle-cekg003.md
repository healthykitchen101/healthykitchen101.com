While the Cuisinart Electric Kettle CPK-17P1 offers superior performance and design, the COMFEE Electric Kettle CEKG003 provides excellent value for those seeking a budget-friendly electric kettle for daily use.

Running the same power draw, the Comfee boils water only slightly slower than the Cuisinart while being just as quiet. It does, however, consume quite a bit more energy. Moreover, the Cuisinart has a keep warm feature to maintain the desired temperature for up to 30 minutes afterward.

Compared to just a simple switch of the Comfee, the Cuisinart is further equipped with six preset temperatures, allowing users to select their desired temperature with ease. Both kettles have water level markings and limescale filter but the Cuisinartâ€™s is removable for easier cleaning.
