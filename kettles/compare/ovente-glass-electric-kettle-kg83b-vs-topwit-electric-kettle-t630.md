The Topwit Electric Kettle T630 has some unique features, but they’re not as good to score better than the just-average Ovente Electric Kettle KG83B.

Design-wise, the Topwit stands out with its rare 2 L capacity, whereas the Ovente has a standard 1.7 L. Both kettles include water-level markings and an LED ring, but the Topwit lacks a proper limescale filter, cord storage, and a lid button—features that the Ovente includes. However, the Ovente, despite being cheaper, suffers from inconvenient button placement.

Even with its higher power draw, the Ovente was slower at boiling water, though it did use the same amount of electricity. Additionally, these two glass kettles have the same subpar heat retention but the Ovente was noisier while in use.
