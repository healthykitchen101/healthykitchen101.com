The plastic Ovente Electric Kettle KP72W and the Bella Ceramic Kettle 14745 stand out from our line up with their materials being different from the common glass. Nonetheless, there can only be one winner.

While the plastic construction of the Ovente makes it less durable than the ceramic Bella, it is also lighter and cheaper. Design-wise, the Ovente includes a water-level window with a white LED and a removable mesh filter, which the Bella lacks.

The Bella offers a gooseneck for precise pouring and a silicone band on the lid for a tighter seal. Unfortunately, the Bella’s base is quite flimsy which indicates low quality.

Performance-wise, the Ovente boiled water faster while consuming less electricity despite its lower power output. It was also quieter while boiling but its glass carafe didn’t retain heat as well as the Bella afterward.
