As our lowest-rated product, the glass Elite Gourmet Electric Kettle (EKT-602) falls well behind the stainless steel Hamilton Beach Electric Kettle 40880.

Due to its lower power consumption, the Elite Gourmet was notably slower in boiling water while consuming more electricity. On a positive note, it outperformed the already quiet Comfee in terms of noise level and exhibited better heat retention despite its glass material.

Design-wise, the Hamilton Beach has a water-level window with a white LED, whereas the Elite Gourmet has water-level markings and a blue LED ring.

The Hamilton Beach has a smaller lid opening and unnecessary extra bottom stands that make the carafe slightly wobbly when boiling but itâ€™s not a big problem. Meanwhile, the Elite Gourmet kettle suffers from buttons positioned too closely together, which can be awkward to use.
