The Aigostar Electric Kettle 300104LCB isn’t bad all things considered but it simply falls behind significantly compared to the Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300—our best glass pick.

Performance-wise, the Aigostar consumed less energy and was slightly quieter than the Peach Street when boiling water. Unfortunately, due to its lower power draw, the former was much slower than the latter which is a major weakness for an electric kettle.

Both kettles have high quality design features like water-level markings and an LED ring on their carafes. However, the Aigostar doesn’t have a silicone band for better sealing and its limescale filter isn’t removable like the Peach Street.

Considering the Peach Street costs only a couple of dollars more, it’s a much more worthwhile choice than the Aigostar.
