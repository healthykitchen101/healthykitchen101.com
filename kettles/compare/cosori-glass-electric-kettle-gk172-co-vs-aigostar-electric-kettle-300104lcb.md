With a slightly higher price, the Cosori Electric Kettle GK172-CO outperforms the Aigostar Electric Kettle 300104LCB a bit in all aspects, including performance, design, and usability.

The two glass kettles feature high-quality design elements, such as water-level markings and an LED ring on their carafes but both their limescale filters aren’t removable. A notable feature of the Cosori kettle is its stainless steel inner lid as opposed to the Aigostar’s plastic one. Meanwhile, the Aigostar has a problem with awkward button placement.

The most significant issue of the Aigostar was its slow boiling speed, which is a major drawback for an electric kettle, even considering its lower power draw. On the bright side, it consumed a lot less electricity, was slightly quieter, and retained heat to the same level as the Cosori.
