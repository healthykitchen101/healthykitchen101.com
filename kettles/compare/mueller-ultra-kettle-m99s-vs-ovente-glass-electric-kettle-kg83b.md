The Ovente Glass Electric Kettle KG83B is best described as average when compared to the Mueller Ultra Kettle M99S.

Even considering its lower power draw, the Ovente was still much slower than the Mueller, not to mention that it consumed slightly more energy. Moreover, the Ovente doesnâ€™t only have a smaller capacity, but its heat retention was worse as well. The silver lining for the kettle was that it was even quieter when boiling.

Both kettles feature high-quality design elements such as water-level markings and LED rings on their carafes, but there are significant differences. The Ovente is less user-friendly, with a non-removable limescale filter and less conveniently placed buttons compared to the Mueller.

Consequently, despite its lower price, these drawbacks make the Ovente less desirable than the Mueller.
