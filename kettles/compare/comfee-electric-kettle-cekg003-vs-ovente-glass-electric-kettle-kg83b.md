Priced lower, the Ovente Glass Electric Kettle KG83B falls short in performance and usability compared to the Comfee Electric Kettle CEKG003.

Both kettles feature high-quality design elements, including water-level markings and LED rings on their carafes. The difference is that the Ovente is less user-friendly due to its awkward button placement while the Comfee’s flat cord doesn’t wrap neatly around the storage.

With a higher power draw, the Comfee boils water in a significantly shorter amount of time. Meanwhile, the Ovente consumed less energy, was quiter, and had better heat retention.
