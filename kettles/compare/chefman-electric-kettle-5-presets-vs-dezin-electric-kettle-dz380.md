Although the Chefman Electric Kettle 5 Presets RJ11-17-CTI-RL has some performance weakness, its unique features allowed it to stand out from the inferior design of the Dezin Electric Kettle DZ380.

The Chefman kettle boasts 5 temperature settings, easily operated through a one-touch control interface, making it just as user-friendly as the single-setting Dezin. Both kettles include an LED ring, but the Chefman's ring changes color according to the selected preset, introducing a playful and practical touch to its design. It also comes with a detachable tea infuser, adding to its versatility.

Unfortunately, the Dezin lacks a proper limescale filter which means it requires more frequent cleaning and descaling. Additionally, the Chefman includes cord storage and a lid button, which the Dezin does not.

Performance-wise, the Chefman was slower at boiling water while consuming more electricity despite a slightly higher power output. Being similarly glass, it was also noisier while boiling and had worse heat retention than the Dezin.
