The Topwit Electric Kettle T630 has some unique features but not all of them are positive. As a result, it lost to the Zeppoli Electric Kettle ZPL-KETTLE.

At a lower price, the Topwit has a rare capacity of 2 L as opposed to the Zeppoliâ€™s more common 1.7 L. Both have water-level markings and an LED ring but the Topwit unfortunately lacks a proper limescale filter, cord storage, and a lid button that the Zeppoli has.

The Topwit was top-tier in terms of quietness when boiling, even better than the excellent score of the Zeppoli. With a lower power draw however, the Topwit consumed more energy and had a slower boiling speed than the Zeppoli. It also had worse heat retention despite also being glass.
