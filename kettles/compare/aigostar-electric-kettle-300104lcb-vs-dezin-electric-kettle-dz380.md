The Aigostar Electric Kettle 300104LCB and the Dezin Electric Kettle DZ380 are quite equal but not in a good way. The Aigostar Electric Kettle 300104LCB isn’t the most high-performing product while the Dezin’s build is lacking.

Both kettles feature water-level markings and an LED ring, but the Dezin is missing standard features such as cord storage and a lid button. It also lacks a proper limescale filter, necessitating more frequent cleaning and descaling. On the other hand, the Aigostar, while cheaper, has its own drawback with awkward button placement.

Despite its higher power draw, the Aigostar was slower at boiling water, though it did consume less electricity. Being similarly made of glass, the Aigostar had worse heat retention than the Topwit but was a bit quieter.
