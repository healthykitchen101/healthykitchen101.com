The Bella Ceramic Kettle 14745, though visually appealing, lacks several important features found in the Comfee Electric Kettle CEKG003. Despite its higher price, the Bella doesn't match the Comfee in value.

Design-wise, the Comfee includes water-level markings, an LED ring, and a fixed mesh filter, which the Bella lacks. However, the Bella offers a gooseneck for precise pouring and a silicone band on the lid for a tighter seal. Unfortunately, the Bellaâ€™s base is quite flimsy.

The Bella's lower power output means it uses less electricity but boils water much slower. In contrast, the Comfee operates more quietly but doesn't retain heat as well.
