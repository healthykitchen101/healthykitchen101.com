When comparing the glass Mueller Ultra Kettle M99S to the plastic Ovente Electric Kettle KP72W, the Ovente initially shows some advantages but ultimately falls short due to its drawbacks.

The Ovente uses slightly less energy and is quieter than the Mueller during boiling. However, it has a much slower boiling time. Additionally, the plastic construction of the Ovente means it lacks the heat retention and durability of the glass Mueller, though it is lighter and cheaper.

Expanding on their designs, both kettles have removable limescale filters. The Mueller includes water-level markings and a blue LED ring, while the Ovente has a water-level window lit by a white LED.
