Although the Bella Ceramic Kettle 14745 poses an attractive aesthetic, its design features are quite lacking compared to the glass Aigostar Electric Kettle 300104LCB.

The Bella includes a gooseneck for precise pouring and a silicone band on the lid for a tighter seal. However, it lacks exterior water-level markings, relying only on an internal maximum volume indicator.

Even though the Bella is more expensive, it doesn't provide as much value as the Aigostar, partly because of its flimsy base. Furthermore, its holed filter is less effective at controlling limescale buildup compared to the Aigostar's mesh filter. However, the Aigostar has its own issue with awkward button placement.

The biggest problem for the Aigostar was its slow boiling speed which is a major weakness for an electric kettle, even considering its lower power draw. Moreover, its heat retention is not good even among similarly glass competitors. On the bright side, it consumed less energy and was quieter than the Bella.
