While the stainless steel Cuisinart CPK-17P1 excels in performance and features, the glass Topwit T630 offers a spacious design and quiet operation.

With a higher power draw, the Cuisinart boiled 1.5 liters of water in a much shorter time while consuming less energy than the Topwit. Its standout feature lies in its ability to maintain temperatures for up to 30 minutes post-boiling. On the other hand, the Topwit excels in providing an exceptionally quiet boiling phase.

The Cuisinart has six preset temperature settings that cater to various beverage preferences while being as easy to control as the Topwit. Both kettles have water level markings and the Topwit should incorporate a more effective limescale filter to reduce the frequency of descaling.
