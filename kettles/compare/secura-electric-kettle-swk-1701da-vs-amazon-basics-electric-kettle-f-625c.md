The stainless steel double-wall Secura Electric Kettle SWK-1701DA scored slightly lower than the glass Amazon Basics Electric Kettle F-625C, but it has noteworthy strengths that made it our top stainless steel pick.

The Secura kettle excelled in heat retention due to its double-wall construction, which also ensures safety by staying cool to the touch during boiling. Additionally, it matched the Amazon Basics in boiling speed and quietness.

However, the Secura kettle lacks a visible water-level indicator on the exterior, although it does have interior measurement markings. Its holed filter is also less effective at managing limescale buildup compared to the removable mesh filter found in the Amazon Basics.
