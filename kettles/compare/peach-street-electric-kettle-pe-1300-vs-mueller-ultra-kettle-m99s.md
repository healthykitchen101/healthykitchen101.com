The Mueller Ultra Kettle (M99S) is our runner up to the Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300 among all of our tested electric glass kettles. Let’s find out why the former lost in this competition.

The Mueller actually has a higher overall performance score thanks to its lower energy consumption. However, the Peach Street was slightly faster at boiling water—the main aspect we care about— and was more quiet doing so.

Being excellent glass kettles, they have similar heat retention. Both kettles have high quality design features like a removable limescale filter, water-level markings, an LED ring, a lid button, and a power switch. Unfortunately, the Mueller’s handle is a little awkwardly shaped, so the Peach Street proved more valuable, especially with its cheaper price tag.
