The CPK-17P1 earns praise for its efficiency, functionality, and modern design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a high-quality electric kettle while the Ovente KG83B is a reliable and budget-friendly option.

Running on 1500 W, the Cuisinart was significantly faster at boiling water. Its six preset temperature settings cater to various beverage preferences while its keep warm feature maintains the temperatures for up to 35 minutes afterward.

The Ovente, on the other hand, consumed only slightly more energy than the Cuisinart with its 1100 W of power. However, it was a lot quieter when boiling.

Both the stainless steel Cuisinart and the glass Ovente have water level markings. However, the Ovente can be improved with a removable limescale filter and better button placement.
