The design of the stainless steel Hamilton Beach Electric Kettle 40880, while not the best, surpasses that of the glass Dezin Electric Kettle DZ380.

In terms of design, the Hamilton Beach has a water-level window with a white LED, while the Aigostar has water-level markings and a blue LED ring. The Hamilton Beach has a smaller lid opening and unnecessary extra bottom stands that make the carafe slightly wobbly when boiling but itâ€™s not a big problem.

Meanwhile, the Dezin lacks a proper limescale filter which means it requires more frequent cleaning and descaling. Additionally, the Hamilton Beach includes cord storage and a lid button, which the Dezin does not.

Thanks to its higher power draw, the Hamilton Beach was significantly faster at boiling water while consuming just a bit more electricity. On the other hand, the Dezin was quieter and had better heat retention despite its glass material.
