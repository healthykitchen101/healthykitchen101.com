The Comfee Electric Kettle CEKG003 was our choice for the best glass pick before the Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300 came. So, why was the Comfee dethroned?

Both kettles have high quality design features like water-level markings, an LED ring, a lid button, and a power switch. However, the Comfee’s limescale filter isn’t removable like the Peach Street. Moreover, its cord doesn’t fit in its storage as well.

At the same power draw, the Peach Street outshines the Comfee with a higher boiling speed, lower energy consumption, quieter operation, and better heat retention. Furthermore, the Peach Street is even cheaper than the already affordable Comfee.
