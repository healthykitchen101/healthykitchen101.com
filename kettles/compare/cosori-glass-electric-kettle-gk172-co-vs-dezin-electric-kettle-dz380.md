The Cosori Electric Kettle GK172-CO wasn’t the best in terms of its design but still much better than the Dezin Electric Kettle DZ380.

While both kettles feature water-level markings and an LED ring, the Dezin lacks some convenient features. The absence of a proper limescale filter in the Dezin kettle means that it requires more frequent cleaning and descaling compared to the Cosori.

The Cosori has a cord storage and a lid button while the Dezin doesn’t. In addition, it has a rare stainless steel inner lid which eliminates any water to plastic contact.

The Dezin consumed less energy, operated more quietly than the Cosori, and had better heat retention, although not by much. To its detriment, its very slow boiling speed garnered it a low score according to our data.
