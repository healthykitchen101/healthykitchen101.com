We don't recommend either the glass Dezin Electric Kettle DZ380 or the Bella Ceramic Kettle 14745. The two have design flaws that make them inconvenient to use, with the Bella being particularly troublesome.

Both kettles have lift-up lids instead of pop-up lids with push buttons. Neither kettle includes a proper mesh limescale filter, a feature commonly found in their peers.

The Dezin has water-level markings and an LED ring, which the Bella lacks. However, it also misses out on cord storage, another standard feature in electric kettles.

On the other hand, the Bella features a rare gooseneck for precision pouring and a silicone band on its lid for a better seal compared to the Dezin. Unfortunately, it suffers from a flimsy base and a heavy carafe.

Performance-wise, the Dezin, with its lower power draw, took longer to boil water than the Bella but consumed less electricity. Despite both kettles being made of glass, the Dezin was quieter during boiling and retained heat better afterward.
