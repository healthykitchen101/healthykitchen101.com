As our lowest-rated product, the Elite Gourmet Electric Kettle (EKT-602) falls far behind the Cosori Electric Kettle GK172-CO.

Even considering its lower power draw, the Elite Gourmet was still much slower while consuming just as much electricity. On the brightside, it scored better than the already quiet Cosori and had better heat retention.

Both kettles boast high-quality design elements, including water-level markings, a removable mesh filter, and an LED ring on their carafes. However, the Elite Gourmet kettle suffers from awkwardly positioned buttons that are too close to each other. Meanwhile, the Cosori features a rare stainless steel inner lid, eliminating any contact between the water and plastic.
