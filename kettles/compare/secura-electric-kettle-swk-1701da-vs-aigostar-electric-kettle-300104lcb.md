Our top stainless steel choice, the double-wall Secura Electric Kettle SWK-1701DA, scored higher than the glass Aigostar Electric Kettle 300104LCB. Despite certain unique strengths, it has some minor drawbacks.

The Secura kettle excels in heat retention thanks to its double-wall construction, which also ensures safety by remaining cool to the touch during boiling. In contrast, the Aigostar's slow boiling speed is a major weakness for an electric kettle, despite its lower power draw. However, the Aigostar consumes noticeably less electricity and is quieter than the Secura during boiling.

Unfortunately, the Secura's holed filter is less effective at managing limescale buildup compared to the Aigostar's mesh filter. Additionally, the Secura lacks a visible water-level indicator on the exterior, though it does have measurement markings inside.
