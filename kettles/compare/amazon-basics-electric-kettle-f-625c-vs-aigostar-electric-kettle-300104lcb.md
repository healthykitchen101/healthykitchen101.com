With a not-too-higher price, the Amazon Basics Electric Kettle F-625C is better than the Aigostar Electric Kettle 300104LCB in all aspects including performance, design, and usability.

Both kettles feature high-quality design elements, such as water-level markings and an LED ring on their carafes. However, the Aigostar’s limescale filter is not removable, unlike the Amazon Basics. On the other hand, the Amazon Basics wobbles a bit while boiling.

Despite both being glass kettles, the Aigostar consumed more energy, was noisier, and had poorer heat retention compared to the Amazon Basics. The most significant issue, however, was the Aigostar’s slow boiling speed, which is a major drawback for an electric kettle, even considering its lower power draw compared to the Amazon Basics.
