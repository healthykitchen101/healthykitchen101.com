Comparing the Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300 and Secura Electric Kettle SWK-1701DA makes for an interesting competition between our best glass pick and our best stainless steel pick. In the end, the latter fell slightly behind due to a few minor weaknesses.

The Secura has better heat retention than the Peach Street thanks to its double-wall design that also makes it safe to touch when boiling. Unfortunately, its slightly slower boiling time, higher energy consumption, and higher noise level dragged down its overall performance score.

Moreover, the Secura lacks a water-level window for measuring from the outside, though it has markings on the inside. Its holed filter also isn’t as effective on limescale as the Peach Street’s mesh filter.
