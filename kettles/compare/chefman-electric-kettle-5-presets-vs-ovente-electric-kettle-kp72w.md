Despite their material differences, the glass Chefman Electric Kettle 5 Presets RJ11-17-CTI-RL and the plastic Ovente Electric Kettle KP72W are quite equal in terms of overall scores. This is because each of them presents a set of strengths and weaknesses unique to their model.

The Chefman includes 5 temperature settings, accessible via a one-touch control, which is as easy to use as the Ovente’s single-setting. It also includes a detachable tea infuser, enhancing its versatility.

Being plastic, the Ovente is lighter and more affordable but it’s not as durable. It has a water-level window illuminated by a white LED. Meanwhile, the Chefman has water level markings and a LED ring that changes color based on the selected preset, adding a fun and practical element to its design.

Both kettles have a removable limescale mesh filter but the Ovente’s smaller lid opening makes cleaning more challenging. The two kettles also have cord storage but the Chefman’s flat cord fits loosely while the Ovente’s is a bit cramped for its round cord. 

At the same power draw, the Ovente was slightly faster at boiling water while consuming a bit less energy. It didn’t have as good heat retention as the Chefman but was, interestingly, a tad quieter.
