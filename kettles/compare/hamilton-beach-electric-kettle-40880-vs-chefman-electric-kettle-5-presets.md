The stainless steel Hamilton Beach Electric Kettle 40880 and the glass Chefman Electric Kettle 5 Presets RJ11-17-CTI-RL are two equal choices each with its own valuable features.

With a higher power output, the Hamilton Beach boiled water faster while consuming less energy. On the other hand, the Chefman was quieter during operation. Interestingly, the two kettles shared the same heat retention despite their material differences.

Design-wise, the Hamilton Beach has a white LED illuminated water-level window while the Chefman has water-level markings and a LED ring that changes color according to the selected preset.

The Chefman kettle boasts 5 temperature settings, easily operated through a one-touch control interface, making it just as user-friendly as the single-setting Hamilton Beach. It also comes with a detachable tea infuser, adding to its versatility, and is priced lower than its opponent.

The Hamilton Beach has unnecessary extra bottom stands that make the carafe slightly wobbly when boiling and a smaller lid opening which makes cleaning a bit more challenging but they’re not big problems. Both kettles have cord storage but their cords don’t wrap neatly.
