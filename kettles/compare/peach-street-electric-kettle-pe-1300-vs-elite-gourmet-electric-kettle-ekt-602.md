The Elite Gourmet Electric Kettle (EKT-602) is our lowest rated product so of course it can’t hold a candle to our best glass pick—the Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300. Nonetheless, it’s still useful to understand what constitutes their differences.

Even considering its lower power draw, the Elite Gourmet was still much slower and consumed much more energy than the Peach Street. On the brightside, it was similarly quiet with equally good heat retention.

Both kettles have high quality design features like water-level markings, a removable mesh filter, and an LED ring on their carafes. However, the Elite Gourmet’s two buttons are awkwardly placed close to one another. On top of everything, the Peach Street is cheaper as well.
