As our lowest-rated product, the Elite Gourmet Electric Kettle (EKT-602) significantly lags behind the Mueller Ultra Kettle M99S, despite its lower price. However, it effectively highlights the differences between a weak and a strong-performing kettle.

Even considering its lower power draw, the Elite Gourmet was still much slower and consumed much more energy than the Mueller. On the brightside, its similar glass carafe had equally good heat retention and was even quieter than the Mueller while boiling.

Both kettles feature high-quality design elements such as water-level markings, a removable mesh filter, and an LED ring on their carafes. However, the Elite Gourmet kettle has two buttons positioned close to each other, which we found awkward to control.
