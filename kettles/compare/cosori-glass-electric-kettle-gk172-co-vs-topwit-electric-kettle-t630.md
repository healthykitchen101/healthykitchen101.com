The Topwit Electric Kettle T630 has some unique features but not all of them are positive. As a result, it lost to the Cosori Electric Kettle GK172-CO in all aspects, including performance, design, and usability.

Design-wise, both have water-level markings and an LED ring. However, the Topwit unfortunately lacks a proper limescale filter, cord storage, and a lid button that the Cosori has.

At a lower price, the Topwit has a rare capacity of 2 L as opposed to the Cosori’s more common 1.7 L.  A notable feature of the Cosori kettle is its stainless steel inner lid as opposed to the Topwit’s plastic one.

Performance-wise, the Cosori had a faster boiling speed thanks to its higher power draw but it consumed significantly more electricity. Moreover, it wasn’t as quiet and its heat retention was as good as the Topwit.
