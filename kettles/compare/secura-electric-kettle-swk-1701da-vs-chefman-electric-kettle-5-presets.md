Both the stainless steel double-walled Secura Electric Kettle SWK-1701DA and the Chefman Electric Kettle 5 Presets offer some interesting and unique features.

The Secura kettle excels in heat retention thanks to its double-wall construction, which also ensures safety by remaining cool to the touch during boiling. Meanwhile, the Chefman offers 5 temperature settings, all accessible through a one-touch control interface.

The Chefman features an LED ring that changes color based on the selected preset, adding a fun and practical element to its design. Additionally, the Chefman includes a detachable tea infuser, enhancing its versatility, and is priced only slightly higher than the Zeppoli.

The Secura lacks a visible water-level indicator on the exterior, though it does have measurement markings inside. Also, its holed filter is less effective at managing limescale buildup compared to the Chefman's removable mesh filter.

Performance-wise, however, the Chefman boiled water more slowly, which is our main evaluating aspect for a kettle. On the bright side, it was quieter when boiling and consumed the same amount of electricity.
