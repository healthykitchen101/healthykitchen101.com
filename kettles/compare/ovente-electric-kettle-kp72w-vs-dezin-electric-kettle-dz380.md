The plastic Ovente Electric Kettle KP72W and the glass Dezin Electric Kettle DZ380 are comparable in their performance. In the end, the former won out thanks to a slightly better design and ease of use.

In terms of design, the Ovente features a water-level window illuminated by a white LED, whereas the Dezin has water-level markings and a blue LED. The Dezin, however, lacks a proper limescale filter, cord storage, and a lid button, all of which the Ovente includes.

While the plastic construction of the Ovente makes it less durable than the Dezin, it is also lighter and cheaper. Its lid opening is somewhat smaller, but still has enough space to fit your hand through.

Both kettles share the same performance score but differ in our specific tests. The Ovente, with its higher power draw, boiled water slightly faster while consuming the same amount of electricity. However, the Dezin was quieter during boiling and showed better heat retention.
