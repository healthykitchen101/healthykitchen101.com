The stainless steel Hamilton Beach Electric Kettle 40880 and the Ovente Electric Kettle KP72W each have their own strengths and weaknesses. In the end, the latter’s drawbacks were what got the best of it.

Looking at the differences in their materials, it’s interesting that the two kettles are similarly shaped. Both kettles have a water-level window illuminated by a white LED and a removable mesh filter. Their lid openings are smaller than the common kettles which makes cleaning a bit more difficult but it’s not a big problem.

Being plastic, the Ovente is lighter and more affordable but it’s not as durable. Meanwhile, the Hamilton Beach has unnecessary extra bottom stands that make the carafe slightly wobbly but not to a dangerous degree.

Due to its higher power draw, the Hamilton Beach boils water significantly faster, though it consumes only slightly more electricity. It was also a bit noisier but with better heat retention than the Ovente.
