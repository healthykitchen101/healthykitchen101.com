Although the Comfee Electric Kettle CEKG003 comes at a slightly higher price, it outperforms the Aigostar Electric Kettle 300104LCB in performance, design, and usability.

Both glass kettles feature high-quality design elements, such as water-level markings and an LED ring on their carafes, but neither has a removable limescale filter. Unfortunately, the Aigostar has an issue with awkward button placement.

The Aigostar's most significant drawback is its slow boiling speed, a major issue for an electric kettle, even considering its lower power draw. On the plus side, it consumed much less electricity, was slightly quieter, and retained heat better than the Comfee.
