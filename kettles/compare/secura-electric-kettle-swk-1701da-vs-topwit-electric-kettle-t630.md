The stainless steel double-wall Secura Electric Kettle SWK-1701DA and the glass Topwit Electric Kettle T630 both have some unique design features. However, the Secura’s made it our best stainless steel choice while the Topwit’s weren’t really useful.

The Secura kettle excels in heat retention thanks to its double-wall construction, which also ensures safety by remaining cool to the touch during boiling. Meanwhile, the Topwit has a rare 2 L capacity and a cheaper price to boot.

Unfortunately, even considering its lower power output, the Topwit's slow boiling speed is a major weakness for an electric kettle. On the bright side, it’s top tier in terms of quietness and consumes noticeably less electricity than the Secura during boiling.

The Secura's holed filter isn’t the most effective but it’s still better than the Topwit which has none. However, the Secura does lack a visible water-level indicator on the exterior that the Topwit has, though it does have measurement markings inside.
