The Amazon Basics Electric Kettle F-625C wasn’t the best in terms of its design but still much better than the Dezin Electric Kettle DZ380.

While both kettles feature water-level markings and an LED ring, the Dezin lacks some convenient features. The absence of a proper limescale filter in the Dezin kettle means that it requires more frequent cleaning and descaling compared to the Amazon Basics.

The Amazon Basics has a cord storage and a lid button while the Dezin doesn’t. Unfortunately, the Amazon Basics kettle has a poor fit with its base coupler, causing it to wobble while boiling.

The Dezin has slightly worse heat retention despite also being glass. Possibly due to its lower power draw, the Dezin boiled water much slower as well. On the bright side, it consumed as little energy as the Amazon Basics while being much quieter when boiling.
