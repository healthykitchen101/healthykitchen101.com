The Elite Gourmet Electric Kettle EKT-602 and the Dezin Electric Kettle DZ380 are both options that we don’t really recommend. The former shows a subpar performance while the latter has a less-than-desirable design.

While both kettles feature water-level markings and an LED ring, the Dezin lacks some convenient features. The absence of a proper limescale filter in the Dezin kettle means that it requires more frequent cleaning and descaling.

The Elite Gourmet has a cord storage and a lid button while the Dezin doesn’t. However, it suffers from inconvenient button placement.

Despite its higher power draw, the Elite Gourmet was slower at boiling water while consuming more electricity. Both being made of glass, the two kettles shared similar noise levels while boiling and heat retention afterward.
