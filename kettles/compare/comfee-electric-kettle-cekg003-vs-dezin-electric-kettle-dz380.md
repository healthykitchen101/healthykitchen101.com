The design of the Comfee Electric Kettle CEKG003, while not the best, surpasses that of the Dezin Electric Kettle DZ380.

Both kettles have water-level markings and an LED ring, but the Dezin lacks several convenient features. Its lack of a proper limescale filter means it requires more frequent cleaning and descaling. Additionally, the Comfee includes cord storage and a lid button, which the Dezin does not.

Despite these drawbacks, the Dezin consumes less energy, operates more quietly, and retains heat better. However, its slow boiling speed led to it scoring lower than the Comfee.
