With a lower price, the Ovente Glass Electric Kettle KG83B suffered from inferiorÂ  performance and usability in comparison with the Cosori Electric Kettle GK172-CO.

The Cosori was only slightly less quiet with slightly worse heat retention and it did consume a lot more electricity. Unfortunately, the Ovente was much slower even considering its lower power draw which really brings down the score.

Both kettles feature high-quality design elements, including water-level markings and LED rings on their carafes, but there are notable differences between them. The Ovente is less user-friendly due to its awkward button placement. Meanwhile, the Cosori has a rare stainless steel inner lid which eliminates any water to plastic contact.
