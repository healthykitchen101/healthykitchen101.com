The stainless steel Hamilton Beach Electric Kettle 40880 and the Aigostar Electric Kettle 300104LCB each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Upon a closer look, the former didn’t have as good a design but a better performance that won out in the end.

In terms of design, the Hamilton Beach has a water-level window with a white LED, while the Aigostar has water-level markings and a blue LED ring. The Hamilton Beach has unnecessary extra bottom stands that make the carafe slightly wobbly when boiling, whereas the Aigostar has awkward button placement

The Aigostar’s mesh filter isn’t removable like the Hamilton Beach but it’s not a big problem. Cleaning is more challenging with the Hamilton Beach unfortunately, due to its smaller lid opening.

Thanks to its higher power draw, the Hamilton Beach was significantly faster at boiling water while consuming just a bit more electricity. Meanwhile, the Aigostar, with its glass material, was quieter but didn’t have as good heat retention.
