The Amazon Basics Electric Kettle F-625C is a solid pick but needs some improvements to be able to catch up to our best glass electric kettle—the Peach Street PE-1300.

At the same power draw, the Amazon Basics boiled water a bit more slowly but consumed slightly less energy. And while still quiet, it’s noticeably noisier than the Peach Street. Moreover, its similar glass carafe doesn’t have as good heat retention as well.

Both kettles have high quality design features including a removable mesh filter, water-level markings, and an LED ring. The Amazon Basics has a silicone band around its underlid for a tighter seal but its base-to-kettle assembly is too wobbly for comfort. To top it all off, the Peach Street costs less than the Amazon Basics, making it the more ideal choice in our book.
