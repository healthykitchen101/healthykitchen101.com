Despite being priced lower, the Ovente Glass Electric Kettle KG83B can only be described as average compared to the Amazon Basics Electric Kettle F-625C.

Even considering its lower power draw, the Ovente was still much slower. On the bright side, it was a lot quieter than the Amazon Basics. Additionally, both of these glass kettles consumed the same amount of electricity and had the same level of heat retention after boiling.

Both kettles feature high-quality design elements, including water-level markings and LED rings on their carafes, but there are notable differences between them. The Ovente is less user-friendly because its limescale filter is not removable, and its button placement is less convenient compared to the Amazon Basics.
