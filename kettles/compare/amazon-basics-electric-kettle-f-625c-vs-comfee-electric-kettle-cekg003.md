The Comfee Electric Kettle CEKG003 was slightly cheaper than the Amazon Basics Electric Kettle F-625C but it scored slightly lower as well.

Both kettles feature high-quality design elements such as water-level markings, an LED ring, a lid button, and a power switch. However, the Comfee lacks a removable limescale filter, and its cord storage is less efficient compared to the Amazon Basics. Conversely, the Amazon Basics kettle has a poor fit with its base coupler, causing it to wobble while boiling.

At the same power draw, the Amazon Basics was better in almost every aspect including boiling speed, energy consumption, and heat retention. The Comfee was a bit quieter when boiling but not by much.
