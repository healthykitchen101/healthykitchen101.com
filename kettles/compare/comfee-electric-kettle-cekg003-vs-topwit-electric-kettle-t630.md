The Topwit Electric Kettle T630 has some unique features, but not all are positive, leading it to fall short compared to the Comfee Electric Kettle CEKG003.

The Topwit uniqueness has nothing to do with its performance that scored better than the Comfee. This was thanks to its quieter boiling and better heat retention afterward. Meanwhile, the Comfee, with a high power draw, had a faster boiling time but consumed too much electricity for its own good.

The more affordable Topwit boasts an uncommon 2-liter capacity, unlike the Comfee's typical 1.7 liters. Both kettles feature water-level indicators and an LED ring. However, the Topwit is missing a dedicated limescale filter, cord storage, and a convenient lid button that come with the Comfee.
