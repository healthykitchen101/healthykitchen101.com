The Bella Ceramic Kettle 14745 features an attractive design but falls short in overall performance compared to the Mueller Ultra Kettle M99S. With lower power output, the Bella boils water more slowly and noisily, consumes more energy, and retains heat less effectively than the Mueller.

Design-wise, the Bella includes a gooseneck for precise pouring and a silicone band on the lid for a tighter seal. However, it lacks exterior water-level markings, relying only on an internal maximum volume indicator.

Despite its higher price, the Bella does not offer the same value as the Mueller, partly due to its flimsy base. Additionally, its holed filter is less effective at managing limescale buildup than the Mueller's mesh filter.
