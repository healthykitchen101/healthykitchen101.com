The Ovente Electric Kettle KG83B didn't score much higher than our lowest-rated product, the Elite Gourmet Electric Kettle EKT-602, for several reasons.

Both kettles boast high-quality design elements, including water-level markings and an LED ring on their carafes. However, they both suffer from awkward placement of the lid and power buttons being too close together. The Elite Gourmet has a slight edge in design with its removable limescale mesh filter, unlike the Ovente's fixed filter.

The Ovente avoided the last place thanks to its average performance. Despite having the same power draw, the Ovente boiled water faster while consuming less energy. Both kettles are made of glass, but the Ovente was quieter during boiling, though it had worse heat retention compared to the Elite Gourmet.
