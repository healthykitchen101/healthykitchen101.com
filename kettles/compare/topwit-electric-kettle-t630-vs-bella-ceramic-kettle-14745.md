The glass Topwit Electric Kettle T630 and the Bella Ceramic Kettle 14745 are both products that we don’t recommend. They all have problems with their design making them inconvenient to use, especially the Bella. Design-wise, the Topwit stands out with its rare 2 L capacity, whereas the Bella has a standard 1.7 L. Both kettles lack a proper mesh limescale filter seen in most of their peers. The Topwit features water-level markings and an LED ring that the Bella lacks. Unfortunately, the Topwit doesn’t have cord storage which is standard in electric kettles. Meanwhile, the Bella features a rare gooseneck for precision pouring. The kettles have a silicone band for its lid, giving it a better seal compared to the Topwit, especially considering both kettles have a lift-up lid instead of a pop-up lid with a push button. Unfortunately, the Bella has a very flimsy base on top of a heavy carafe. Due to its lower power draw, the Topwit took longer to boil water than the Bella but it consumed less electricity. The two kettles showed the same level of heat retention after boiling but the Topwit was quieter during operation.
