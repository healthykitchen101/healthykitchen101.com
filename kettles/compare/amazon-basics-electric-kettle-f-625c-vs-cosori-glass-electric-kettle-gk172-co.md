At similar prices, the Amazon Basics Electric Kettle F-625C is slightly better than the Cosori Electric Kettle (GK172-CO) in performance and usability but not design.

At the same power draw, the Amazon Basics was a bit slower when boiling water. On the other hand, the Cosori consumed significantly more energy although it was slightly quieter. The Amazon Basics also retained heat slightly better despite both kettles being similarly made of glass.

These two kettles boast high-quality design features such as water-level markings, an LED ring, a lid button, and a power switch. They also have large openings that make cleaning easy.

A notable feature of the Cosori kettle is its stainless steel inner lid, ensuring no plastic comes into contact with the water. However, unlike the Amazon Basics kettle, the Cosori's limescale filter is not removable, making frequent maintenance more challenging. On the other hand, the Amazon Basics wobbles a bit while boiling.
