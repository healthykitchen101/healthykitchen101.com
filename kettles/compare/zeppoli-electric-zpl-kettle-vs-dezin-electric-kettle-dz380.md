The Zeppoli Electric Kettle ZPL-KETTLE wasnâ€™t the best in terms of its design but still much better than the Dezin Electric Kettle DZ380.

While both kettles feature water-level markings and an LED ring, the Dezin lacks some convenient features. Specifically, the Dezin does not include cord storage or a lid button. Additionally, the absence of a proper limescale filter in the Dezin kettle means that it requires more frequent cleaning and descaling compared to the Zeppoli.

The two glass carafes pose similar heat retention. Unfortunately, the Dezin had a much slower boiling speed, possible due to its lower power draw. Moreover, it consumed slightly more energy while being a bit noisier as well.
