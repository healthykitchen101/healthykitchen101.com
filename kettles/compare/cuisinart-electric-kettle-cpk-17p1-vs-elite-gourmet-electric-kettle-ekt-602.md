While the CPK-17P1 caters to those seeking premium features and superior build quality, the EKT-602 appeals to users prioritizing affordability and practicality.

Running 1500 W, both kettles have similarly great scores regarding boiling speed, energy consumption, and noise level. However, the Cuisinartâ€™s ability to maintain temperatures for up to 30 minutes gives it a much stronger edge in terms of keeping the water warm.

Both the stainless steel Cuisinart and the glass Elite Gourmet have water level markings. However, the Ovente can be improved with a removable limescale filter and better button placement.
