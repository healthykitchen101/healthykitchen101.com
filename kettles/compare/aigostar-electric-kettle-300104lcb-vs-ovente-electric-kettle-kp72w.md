In terms of overall scores, both the Aigostar Electric Kettle 300104LCB and the plastic Ovente Electric Kettle KP72W are average. This is a shame because the Ovete initially showed some advantages but ultimately fell short due to its drawbacks.

The plastic construction of the Ovente means it’s lighter and cheaper but also less durable than the Aigostar. In terms of design features, the Aigostar includes water-level markings and a blue LED ring, while the Ovente has a water-level window lit by a white LED.

Cleaning-wise, the Ovente’s mesh filter, as opposed to the Aigostar’s fixed one, helps reduce the descaling frequency. Its lid opening is a bit smaller but you can still fit your hand through.

At the same power output, the Aigostar boiled water slower while consuming more energy than the Ovente. Despite their material differences, both have equally bad heat retention although the Aigostar was a tag bid quieter while boiling.
