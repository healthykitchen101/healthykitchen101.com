The Bella Ceramic Kettle 14745 may look appealing, but it falls short in functionality when compared to the Ovente Glass Electric Kettle KG83B 300104LCB.

The Bella features a gooseneck for precision pouring and a silicone band on the lid for a better seal. However, it lacks convenient exterior water-level markings, providing only an internal maximum volume indicator.

Despite its higher price, the Bella doesn't offer as much value as the Ovente, partly due to its flimsy base. Additionally, its holed filter isn't as effective at preventing limescale buildup as the Ovente's mesh filter. On the downside, the Ovente has poorly placed buttons that are too close to one another.

Even considering its lower power draw, the Ovente's biggest drawback is its slow boiling speed, which is a significant issue for an electric kettle. On the positive side, it is more energy-efficient and quieter than the Bella. Both kettles have similarly subpar heat retention despite their different materials.
