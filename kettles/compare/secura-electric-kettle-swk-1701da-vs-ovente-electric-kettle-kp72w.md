The double-wall Secura Electric Kettle SWK-1701DA—our best stainless steel choice—scored higher than the plastic Ovente Electric Kettle KP72W. Nonetheless, their material differences bring up some interesting comparison.

Performance-wise, the Secura boiled water much faster thanks to its higher power draw. On the other hand, the Ovente consumed less electricity and was quieter.

The Secura kettle excels in heat retention thanks to its double-wall construction, which also ensures safety by remaining cool to the touch during boiling. In contrast, being made of plastic, the Ovente compensates with a lighter weight and lower price point.

The Secura's holed filter is less effective at managing limescale buildup compared to the Ovente's removable mesh filter. It also lacks a visible water-level indicator on the exterior, though it does have measurement markings inside. However, the Ovente's smaller lid opening makes cleaning a bit more challenging compared to the Secura.
