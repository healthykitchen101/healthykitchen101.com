The Ovente Electric Kettle KG83B and the Dezin Electric Kettle DZ380 are comparable, but not in a favorable way. The Ovente isn't particularly high-performing, and the Dezin's build quality is subpar.

Both kettles come with water-level markings and an LED ring. However, the Dezin lacks standard features like cord storage, a lid button, and an effective limescale filterâ€”meaning more frequent cleaning and descaling are necessary. On the other hand, the Ovente, while costs slightly less, has an inconvenient button placement.

Despite drawing more power, the Ovente was slower at boiling water, though it used the same amount of electricity. These two kettles are both made of glass and were equally quiet while boiling but the Ovente had worse heat retention compared to the Dezin.
