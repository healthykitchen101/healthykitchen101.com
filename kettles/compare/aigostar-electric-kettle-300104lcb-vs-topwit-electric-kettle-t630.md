The Aigostar Electric Kettle 300104LCB and the Topwit Electric Kettle T630 are quite equal but not in a good way. The Aigostar Electric Kettle 300104LCB isn’t the most high-performing product. On the other hand, the Topwit has some unique features, but not all are positive.

The Topwit offers a rare 2 L capacity, compared to the Aigostar’s standard 1.7 L. Both kettles have water-level markings and an LED ring, but the Topwit lacks a proper limescale filter, cord storage, and a lid button that the Aigostar has. Meanwhile, the Aigostar is cheaper but has its own issue with awkward button placement.

Despite its higher power draw, the Aigostar was slower at boiling water, though it did consume less electricity. Moreover, although both are made of glass, the Aigostar was noisier while boiling and had worse heat retention than the Topwit.
