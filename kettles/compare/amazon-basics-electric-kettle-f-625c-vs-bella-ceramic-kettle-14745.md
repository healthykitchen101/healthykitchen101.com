While the Bella Ceramic Kettle 14745 boasts an attractive design, it has some significant drawbacks compared to the Amazon Basics Electric Kettle F-625C. Despite its higher price, the former fails to offer the same level of value as the latter.

With a lower power output, the Bella boiled water slower while consuming more electricity. On the bright side, it was as quiet and retained heat just as well as the Amazon Basics.

In terms of design features, the Bella offers a gooseneck for precise pouring and a silicone band on its lid for a tighter seal. However, it lacks water-level markings and relies solely on a maximum volume indicator inside.

The Amazon Basics's mesh filter is more effective than the Bella’s holed filter. It also has a more sturdy base but doesn’t fit the kettle perfectly.
