The Cuisinart Electric Kettle CPK-17P1 emerges as a top-tier choice, offering a blend of superior performance, design, and user-friendly features compared to the basic Dezin Electric Kettle DZ380.

With a higher power draw, the Cuisinart boiled water faster while consuming less energy. Moreover, its ability to maintain temperatures for up to 30 minutes post-boiling adds convenience for users who prefer to enjoy hot beverages over an extended period.

The Cuisinart also has six preset settings catering to different types of tea and coffee, all with one-touch operation. On the bright side, the Dezin was much quieter when boiling.

Design-wise, the Dezin lacking a limescale filter requires more frequent cleaning than the Cuisinart. It also doesnâ€™t have the common cord storage.
