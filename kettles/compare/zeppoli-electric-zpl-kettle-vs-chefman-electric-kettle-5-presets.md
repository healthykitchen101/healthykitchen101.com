The Chefman Electric Kettle 5 Presets offers some rare and valuable features that the Zeppoli Electric Kettle ZPL-KETTLE doesn’t. Unfortunately, the former’s performance score really brings down the score comparison between the two.

The Chefman offers 5 temperature settings, all accessible through a one-touch control interface, mirroring the single-setting functionality of the Zeppoli. Both kettles feature an LED ring, but the Chefman's ring changes color based on the selected preset, adding a fun and practical element to its design. Additionally, the Chefman includes a detachable tea infuser, enhancing its versatility, and is priced only slightly higher than the Zeppoli.

However, the Chefman falls short in terms of boiling speed, energy consumption, noise level, and heat retention. Additionally, while both kettles come with a removable limescale filter, the Chefman's smaller lid opening may pose challenges during cleaning.
