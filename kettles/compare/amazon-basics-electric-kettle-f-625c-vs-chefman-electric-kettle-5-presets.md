The Chefman Electric Kettle 5 Presets offers some rare and valuable features that the Amazon Basics Electric Kettle F-625C doesn’t. Unfortunately, the former’s performance score really brings down the score comparison between the two.

The Chefman offers 5 temperature settings, all accessible through a one-touch control interface, as easy to use as the single-setting functionality of the Amazon Basics. It also includes a detachable tea infuser, enhancing its versatility, and is priced only slightly higher than the Amazon Basics.

Both kettles feature an LED ring, but the Chefman's ring changes color based on the selected preset, adding a fun and practical element to its design. Unfortunately, the Amazon Basics is slightly wobbly while boiling due to an ill-fitting coupler.

These two kettles are made of glass so they have similar heat retention properties. However, the Chefman falls short in terms of boiling speed and energy consumption due to its lower power draw. On the bright side, it’s one of the more quiet kettles in our line-up.
