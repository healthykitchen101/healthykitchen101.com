The plastic Ovente Electric Kettle KP72W barely scored higher than the glass Elite Gourmet Electric Kettle EKT-602. Here are the reasons.

While the plastic construction of the Ovente makes it less durable than the Elite Gourmet, it is also lighter and cheaper. As for their features, the Ovente has a water-level window illuminated by a white LED while the Elite Gourmet features water-level markings and a blue LED ring.

Both kettles have removable limescale filters, but the Ovente's smaller lid opening makes cleaning more challenging. On the other hand, the Elite Gourmet suffers from awkward placement of the lid and power buttons being too close together.

At the same power draw, the Elite Gourmet boiled water too slowly and consumed too much electricity compared to the Ovente. At least, it was as quiet while boiling and had better heat retention.
