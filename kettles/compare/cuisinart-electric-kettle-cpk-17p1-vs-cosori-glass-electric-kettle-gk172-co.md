While the Cuisinart CPK-17P1 offers additional features such as keep-warm functionality and a memory function, the CosoriI GK172-CO stands out with its transparent body and LED illumination, providing users with a visually pleasing and convenient brewing experience. When it comes to performance, the Cuisinart is slightly faster in terms of boiling water and slightly less noisy but consumes way less energy than the Cosori.

The Cuisinart has temperature settings ranging from 160°F to 212°F while the Cosori is 120°F to 212°F. However, the former has a keep-warm feature that maintains the desired temperature for up to 30 minutes, appealing to users who prefer convenience and flexibility in their brewing process.

Both kettles have a capacity of 1.7 liters, suitable for households needing larger quantities of hot water. They both also prioritize safety with automatic shut-off functionality and boil-dry protection. 

Depending on preferences and priorities, users can choose between the sleek stainless steel design of the Cuisinart kettle or the modern elegance of the COSORI glass kettle to suit their kitchen aesthetics and brewing needs.
