Although the Bella Ceramic Kettle 14745 features an attractive design, it falls short in several key areas compared to the Cosori Glass Electric Kettle GK172-CO. Despite its higher price, the Bella doesn't deliver the same value as the Cosori.

In terms of design features, the Cosori has water-level markings, an LED ring, and a removable mesh filter that the Bella doesnâ€™t. Meanwhile, the Bella offers a gooseneck for precise pouring and a silicone band on its lid for a tighter seal. Unfortunately, the Bella has a very flimsy base.

With a lower power output, the Bella consumed less electricity but also boiled water much slower. On the other hand, the Cosori was quieter but had worse heat retention.
