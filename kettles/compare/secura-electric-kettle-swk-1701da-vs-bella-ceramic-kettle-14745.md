Our top stainless steel choice—the double-wall Secura Electric Kettle SWK-1701DA is, without a doubt, a better choice than the Bella Ceramic Kettle 14745. Nonetheless, their comparison does make for some interesting points.

The Secura kettle excels in heat retention thanks to its double-wall construction, which also ensures safety by remaining cool to the touch during boiling. Both of these strengths, the Bella doesn’t possess.

The Bella boiled water a bit more slowly while consuming a bit more energy, possibly due to its lower power draw. At least it’s as quiet when boiling as the Secura.

Design-wise, both lack a visible water-level indicator on the exterior. They also share a similar holed filter which isn’t as effective at managing limescale buildup as a mesh one.

The Bella does include a gooseneck for precise pouring and a silicone band on the lid for a tighter seal that the Secura doesn’t. However, we don’t think these features were enough to justify a higher price and inferior performance.
