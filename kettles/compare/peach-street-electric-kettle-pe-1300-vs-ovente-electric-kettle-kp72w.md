Between the glass Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300 and the plastic Ovente Electric Kettle KP72W, the latter has some interesting strengths but in the end, its weaknesses got the best of it.

With a lower power output, the Ovente consumes significantly less energy while being similarly quiet as the Peach Street. Unfortunately, it boils water much slower than its competitor.

Being plastic, the Ovente doesn’t retain heat as well and may not be as durable as the glass Peach Street. However, it’s lighter in weight and also in price.

The Peach Street’s has water-level markings and a blue LED ring while the Ovente’s uses a water-level window with a white LED. Although both have a removable limescale filter, the Ovente’s lid opening is smaller making cleaning a bit more difficult compared to the Peach Street.
