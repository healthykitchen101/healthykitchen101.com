In terms of overall score, the Chefman Electric Kettle 5 Presets RJ11-17-CTI-RL wasn’t much higher than the Elite Gourmet Electric Kettle EKT-602—our lowest-rated product. However, it offers some unique valuable features that really separate it from its opponent.

The Chefman offers 5 temperature settings, easily accessed through a one-touch control, similar in ease of use to the Elite Gourmet's single-setting. Both kettles come with a limescale mesh filter and an LED ring, but the Chefman's LED ring changes color according to the selected preset, adding a fun and practical aspect to its design.

Although it is priced higher, the Chefman also includes a detachable tea infuser, increasing its versatility. In contrast, the Elite Gourmet kettle has buttons that are too closely spaced, making them awkward to use.

At the same power draw, the Chefman boiled water faster while consuming less electricity compared to the Elite Gourmet. It was similarly quieter while boiling but didn’t have as good heat retention as its competitor despite also being made of glass.
