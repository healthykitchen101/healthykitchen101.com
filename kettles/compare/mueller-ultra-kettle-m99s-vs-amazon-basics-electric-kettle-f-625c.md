The cheaper Amazon Basics Electric Kettle F-625C is a solid choice with only a few weaker aspects than the Mueller Ultra Kettle M99S.

At the same power draw, the two kettles showed equal boiling speed. However, the Amazon Basics consumed slightly more energy and was noisier while boiling. Most of all, it didnâ€™t retain heat as well as the Mueller despite also being made of glass.

Talking about design, both kettles boast high-quality elements, such as a removable mesh filter, water-level markings, and an LED ring. The Amazon Basics kettle includes a silicone band around its underlid to ensure a tighter seal that the Mueller lacks. Unfortunately, its score is heavily brought down due to its wobble base-to-kettle assembly.
