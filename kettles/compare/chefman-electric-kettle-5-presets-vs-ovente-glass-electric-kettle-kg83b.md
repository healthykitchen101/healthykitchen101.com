Although the Chefman Electric Kettle 5 Presets RJ11-17-CTI-RL scored only one decimal point higher than the Ovente Electric Kettle KG83B overall, it offers some uniquely valuable features.

The Chefman includes 5 temperature settings, accessible via a one-touch control, which is as easy to use as the Ovente’s single-setting. Both kettles are equipped with a limescale mesh filter and an LED ring, but the Chefman’s LED ring changes color based on the selected preset, adding a fun and practical element to its design.

While the Chefman is priced higher, it includes a detachable tea infuser, enhancing its versatility. In contrast, the Ovente has an issue with awkward button placement.

With the same power draw, the Chefman boils water faster while consuming more energy than the Ovente. Both being similarly made of glass, they shared the same level of heat retention but the Ovente was slightly quieter while boiling.
