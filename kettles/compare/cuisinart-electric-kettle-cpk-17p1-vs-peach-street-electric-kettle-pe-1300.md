While the Cuisinart Electric Kettle CPK-17P1 offers advanced features, the Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300 provides simplicity in design.

Both equipped with 1500 W, the Cuisinart boils water faster while consuming less energy. Plus, it excels at retaining the chosen temperatures thanks to its keep warm feature of up to 30 minutes. On the other hand, the Peach Street is much quieter when boiling.

In terms of design, the Cuisinart CPK-17P1 features a sleek stainless steel exterior with a modern aesthetic, complemented by a comfortable handle, and an intuitive control panel. In contrast, the Peach Street PE-1300 showcases a simple glass build with an LED ring.

Both electric kettles are user-friendly but the Cuisinart goes the extra mile with 5 preset temperature settings. Meanwhile, the Peach Street PE-1300 offers straightforward operation with its single-touch power switch. Both have a limescale filter thatâ€™s removable for cleaning.
