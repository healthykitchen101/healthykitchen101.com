The Topwit Electric Kettle T630 has some unique features but not all of them are positive. As a result, it lost to the Amazon Basics Electric Kettle F-625C.

The two glass kettles consumed the same amount of electricity and had the same level of heat retention. With a lower power draw, the Topwit boiled water more slowly than the Amazon Basics. On the other hand, the Topwit was top-tier in terms of quietness when boiling compared to just a good score from the Amazon Basics.

Both have water-level markings and an LED ring. At a lower price, the Topwit has a rare capacity of 2 L as opposed to the Amazon Basicsâ€™s more common 1.7 L. However, the Topwit unfortunately lacks a proper limescale filter, cord storage, and a lid button that the Amazon Basics has.
