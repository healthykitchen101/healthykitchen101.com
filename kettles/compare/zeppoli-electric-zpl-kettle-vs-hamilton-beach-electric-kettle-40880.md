The Hamilton Beach Electric Kettle (40880) is a solid choice for a low-cost stainless steel kettle but it has a few problems that garnered it lower scores than glass Zeppoli Electric Kettle ZPL-KETTLE.

Having the same power draw, both kettles had quite similar boiling speed. However, the Hamilton Beach consumed more energy and was noisier. Worst of all, it didn’t even retain heat as well as the Zeppoli despite its stainless steel material.

The Hamilton Beach’s carafe uses a water-level window with a white LED while the Zeppoli’s glass carafe has water-level markings and a blue LED ring.

Although both have a removable limescale filter, the Hamilton Beach’s lid opening is smaller making cleaning a bit more difficult compared to the Zeppoli. Moreover, the Hamilton Beach has some unnecessary extra bottom stands that make the carafe slightly wobbly when boiling.
