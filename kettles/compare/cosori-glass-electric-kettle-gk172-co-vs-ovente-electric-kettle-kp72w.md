When comparing the glass Cosori Electric Kettle GK172-CO with the plastic Ovente Electric Kettle KP72W, the Ovente initially presents some notable advantages but ultimately falls short due to its drawbacks.

Design-wise, the Cosori features water-level markings and a blue LED ring, while the Ovente has a water-level window illuminated by a white LED. The Cosori has a rare stainless steel inner lid which eliminates any water to plastic contact.

Being plastic, the Ovente is lighter and more affordable but it’s not as durable. Its mesh filter is removable, unlike the Cosori, but its smaller lid opening makes cleaning more challenging. 

Despite one being glass and the other plastic, both didn’t have good heat retention compared to the average kettles we’ve tested. The Ovente consumed less energy and operated more quietly than the Cosori. However, its very slow boiling speed was a detriment in our tabulation.
