The Cuisinart Electric Kettle CPK-17P1 appeals to users seeking versatility while the Hamilton Beach Electric Kettle 40880 offers a more budget-friendly option.

Both have a stainless steel design and a 1.7-liter capacity. Safety features such as automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection ensure user safety during operation.

The Cuisinart is the winner because its temperature settings ranging from 160°F to 212°F cater to brewing various beverages to perfection. Additionally, the keep-warm feature maintains the desired temperature for up to 30 minutes, appealing to users who prefer convenience and flexibility in their brewing process. To top it all off, it boils water faster, consumes less energy, and is quieter than the Hamilton Beach.
