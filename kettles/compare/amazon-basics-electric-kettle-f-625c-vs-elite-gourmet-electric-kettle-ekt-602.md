As our lowest-rated product, the Elite Gourmet Electric Kettle (EKT-602) is vastly inferior to a quality kettle like the Amazon Basics F-625C. Nonetheless, it effectively highlights the differences between a poorly performing kettle and a strong one.

Even considering its lower power draw, the Elite Gourmet was still much slower and consumed much more energy. On the brightside, it scored better than the already quiet Amazon Basics and had slightly better heat retention.

Both kettles feature high-quality design elements, including water-level markings, a removable mesh filter, and an LED ring on their carafes. In terms of weaknesses,Â  the Elite Gourmet kettle's two buttons are awkwardly positioned close to each other while the Amazon Basics kettle has a poor fit with its base coupler.
