The Cosori Glass Electric Kettle GK172-CO and the stainless steel Hamilton Beach Electric Kettle (40880) are two decent choices with separate strengths and weaknesses of their own. In the end, the former came out on top thanks to a better thought out build at a cheaper price.

With the same power output, both had similarly good boiling speed. The Cosori was slightly quieter than the already good result of the Hamilton Beach but its glass material didn’t retain heat as well after boiling. Unfortunately, it consumed significantly more electricity than its opponent.

Design-wise, the Hamilton Beach has a water-level window with a white LED while the Cosori has water-level markings and a blue LED ring. A notable feature of the Cosori kettle is its stainless steel inner lid as opposed to the Hamilton Beach’s plastic one.

When it comes to descaling, the Cosori’s limescale filter isn’t removable like the Hamilton Beach but it’s not a big problem. As for cleaning however, the Hamilton Beach’s lid opening is smaller, making it a bit more difficult. Moreover, the Hamilton Beach has some unnecessary extra bottom stands that make the carafe slightly wobbly when boiling.
