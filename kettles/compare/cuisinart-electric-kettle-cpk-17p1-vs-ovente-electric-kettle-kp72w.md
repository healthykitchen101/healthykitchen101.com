The stainless steel Cuisinart Electric Kettle CPK-17P1 PerfecTemp is an all round top performer while the plastic Ovente Electric Kettle KP72W has the main benefits of being light in weight and cheap in price.

With a lower power draw, the Ovente was significantly slower than the Cuisinart in terms of boiling speed. On the bright side, the Ovente consumed a similar amount of energy while being just slightly more noisy.

The Cuisinart’s most outstanding feature however, is its ability to maintain temperatures for up to 30 minutes after running. Moreover, its 6 temperature settings are intuitive to use.

In terms of design, the Cuisinart CPK-17P1 showcases a sleek stainless steel exterior as opposed to the Ovente’s plastic material which may be a cause for health concerns and not as long-lasting. Both have a water level window for precise measuring and removable limescale filter for easy cleaning.
