If the Bella Ceramic Kettle 14745 possesses a more appealing visual, then the glass Chefman Electric Kettle 5 Presets RJ11-17-CTI-RL scores better for its versatility and overall value.

The Chefman offers 5 temperature settings, all accessible through a one-touch control interface. It further features an LED ring that changes color based on the selected preset, adding a fun and practical element to its design. Additionally, the Chefman includes a detachable tea infuser and is priced even lower than the Bella.

The Bella has a gooseneck for more precise pouring and a silicone band for its lid making it close more tightly. However, it has no water-level markings like the Chefman, only a maximum volume indicator inside. Its holed filter also isn’t as effective on limescale as the Chefman’s mesh filter. Moreover, the Bella’s carafe is a heavy build on top of a flimsy base.

Performance-wise, the Chefman boiled water more slowly due to its lower power draw. On the bright side, it consumed less electricity and was quieter than the Bella. Despite their material differences, they had the same level of heat retention.
