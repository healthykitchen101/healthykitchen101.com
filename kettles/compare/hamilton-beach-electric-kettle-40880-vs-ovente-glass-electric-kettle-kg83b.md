The stainless steel Hamilton Beach Electric Kettle 40880 and the Ovente Glass Electric Kettle KG83B each have their own pros and cons. Upon closer inspection, the Hamilton Beach may not have as appealing a design, but its superior performance ultimately gives it an edge.

Due to its higher power draw, the Hamilton Beach boils water significantly faster, though it consumes only slightly more electricity. Interestingly, both kettles have similar heat retention despite their different materials, with the Ovente being quieter during boiling.

Design-wise, the Hamilton Beach features a white LED-illuminated water-level window, while the Ovente has water-level markings and a blue LED ring. The Hamilton Beach's extra bottom stands make the carafe slightly wobbly when boiling, whereas the Ovente suffers from awkward button placement.

Additionally, the Ovente’s mesh filter is not removable like the Hamilton Beach’s, though this isn’t a major issue. However, cleaning the Hamilton Beach is more challenging due to its smaller lid opening.
