The Topwit Electric Kettle T630 has some unique features, but not all are positive, leading it to fall short compared to the Mueller Ultra Kettle M99S.

Despite being priced lower, the Topwit offers a rare 2 L capacity, compared to the Muellerâ€™s standard 1.7 L. Both kettles have water-level markings and an LED ring, but the Topwit lacks a proper limescale filter, cord storage, and a lid button that the Mueller has.

The Topwit excelled in quietness when boiling, surpassing even the highly-rated Mueller. However, its lower power draw resulted in higher energy consumption and slower boiling speed than the Mueller. Additionally, despite also being made of glass, it had poorer heat retention.
