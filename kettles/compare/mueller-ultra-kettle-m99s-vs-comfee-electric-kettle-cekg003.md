The Comfee Electric Kettle CEKG003 initially showed promise, but the newer models we reviewed have surpassed it. Despite its cheaper price, one of the few that outshone it was the Mueller Ultra Kettle M99S.

At the same power draw, the Comfee was slightly slower and noisier when boiling water. However, it consumed significantly more electricity than the Mueller. Also, despite being similarly made of glass, it didnâ€™t retain heat as well as its opponent.

Both kettles feature high-quality design elements, such as water-level markings, an LED ring, a lid button, and a power switch. However, the Comfee lacks a removable limescale filter and its cord storage is less efficient compared to the Mueller.
