The lackluster design of the Dezin Electric Kettle DZ380 can’t compare to our best stainless steel choice—the double-wall Secura Electric Kettle SWK-1701DA.

The Dezin does not include cord storage or a lid button. Additionally, it doesn’t even have a proper filter to compare to the Secura’s holed filter, requiring users to clean and descale the kettle more frequently.

The Secura does lack a visible water-level indicator on the exterior that the Dezin has, though it does have measurement markings inside. On the other hand, the Secura kettle excelled in heat retention thanks to its double-wall construction, which also ensured safety by remaining cool to the touch during boiling.

Performance-wise, the Dezin had a slower boiling speed due to its lower power draw compared to the Secura. On the bright side, it consumed less energy and was quieter while boiling.
