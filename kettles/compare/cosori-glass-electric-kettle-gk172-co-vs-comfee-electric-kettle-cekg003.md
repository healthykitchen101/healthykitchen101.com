The Comfee Electric Kettle CEKG003 was slightly cheaper than the Cosori Electric Kettle GK172-CO but it scored slightly lower as well.

At the same power draw, the former had a slower boiling speed, was less quiet when boiling, and had worse heat retention. Both consumed a lot of electricity to the same amount but that was obviously not a strength.

Both kettles feature high-quality design elements such as water-level markings, a mesh filter, an LED ring, and a lid button clearly separated from a power switch. However, the Comfee has a less efficient cord storage. Conversely, the Cosori has a rare stainless steel inner lid which eliminates any water to plastic contact.
