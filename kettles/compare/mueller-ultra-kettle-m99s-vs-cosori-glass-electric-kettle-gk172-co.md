The Mueller Ultra Kettle (M99S) and the Cosori Glass Electric Kettle GK172-CO were nearly tied in our data analysis. The key distinctions between them emerged from our performance assessments.

At the same power draw, the two kettles have similar boiling speed and noise level while boiling. However, the Cosori consumed a lot more energy. Also, the Mueller retained heat better after boiling despite both being glass.

Both kettles offer premium design features, including a removable limescale filter, water-level markings, an LED ring, a lid button, and a power switch. One notable feature of the Cosori kettle is its stainless steel inner lid, so thereâ€™s no plastic to water contact.

However, unlike the Mueller, the Cosori's limescale filter is not removable for frequent maintenance. On the other hand, we noticed that the handle of the Mueller kettle is somewhat awkwardly shaped.
