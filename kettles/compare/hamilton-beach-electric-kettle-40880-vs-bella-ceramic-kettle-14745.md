The stainless steel Hamilton Beach Electric Kettle 40880 and the Bella Ceramic Kettle 14745 each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Upon a closer look, the former outshone the latter in every aspect including performance, design, and usability despite a lower price.

The Bella's lower power output made it boil water much slower but also consumed more electricity. Interestingly, the two kettles shared the same noise level and heat retention despite their material differences.

Design-wise, the Comfee includes a water-level window with a white LED and a fixed mesh filter, which the Bella lacks. However, the Bella offers a gooseneck for precise pouring and a silicone band on the lid for a tighter seal.

Unfortunately, the Bella’s base is quite flimsy which indicates low quality. Meanwhile, the Hamilton Beach has unnecessary extra bottom stands that make the carafe slightly wobbly when boiling and a smaller lid opening which makes cleaning a bit more challenging but they’re not big problems.
