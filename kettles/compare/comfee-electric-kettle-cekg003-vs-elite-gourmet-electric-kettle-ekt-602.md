Ranked as our lowest-rated product, the Elite Gourmet Electric Kettle (EKT-602) significantly lags behind the Comfee Electric Kettle CEKG003.

Due to its lower power consumption, the Elite Gourmet was notably slower in boiling water while using a comparable amount of electricity. On a positive note, it outperformed the already quiet Comfee in terms of noise level and exhibited better heat retention.

Both kettles feature high-quality design elements such as water-level markings, a mesh filter, and an LED ring on their carafes. However, the Elite Gourmet kettle suffers from buttons positioned too closely together, which can be awkward to use. In contrast, the Comfee's flat cord does not fit neatly into its storage compartment.
