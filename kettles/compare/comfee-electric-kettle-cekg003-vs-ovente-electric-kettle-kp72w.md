When comparing the glass Comfee Electric Kettle CEKG003 with the plastic Ovente Electric Kettle KP72W, the Ovente initially presents some notable advantages but ultimately falls short due to its drawbacks.

Being plastic, the Ovente is lighter and more affordable but it’s not as durable. Its mesh filter is removable, unlike the Comfee, but its smaller lid opening makes cleaning more challenging. 

The Comfee features water-level markings and a blue LED ring, while the Ovente has a water-level window illuminated by a white LED. Both kettles have cord storage but the Comfee’s flat cord fits loosely while the Ovente’s is a bit cramped for its round cord.

Performance-wise, the Comfee, with its higher power draw, boils water much faster. In contrast, the Ovente uses less energy, operates more quietly, and retains heat better despite its material.
