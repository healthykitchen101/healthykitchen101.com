With a slightly higher price, the Zeppoli Electric Kettle ZPL-KETTLE is slightly better than the Aigostar Electric Kettle 300104LCB in all aspects including performance, design, and usability.

Both kettles have high quality design features like water-level markings and an LED ring on their carafes. However, the Aigostar’s limescale filter isn’t removable like the Zeppoli.

Although both are glass kettles, the Aigostar consumed more energy, was more noisy, and didn’t retain heat as well as the Zeppoli. The biggest problem, however, was the Aigostar’s slow boiling speed which is a major weakness for an electric kettle, even considering its lower power draw compared to the Zeppoli.
