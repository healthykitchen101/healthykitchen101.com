The design of the Dezin Electric Kettle DZ380 was a huge let down compared to the Peach Street Electric Kettle PE-1300â€”our best glass pick.

Both kettles have water-level markings and an LED ring but the Topwit unfortunately lacks cord storage and a lid button that the Peach Street has. Moreover, not having a proper limescale filter requires the Topwit to be cleaned and descaled more frequently.

Performance-wise, the Dezin consumed slightly less energy while having equally good noise level and heat retention as the Peach Street. However, it had a much slower boiling speed, possible due to its lower power draw.
